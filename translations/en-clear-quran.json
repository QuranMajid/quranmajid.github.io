  "And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his people, “Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow.”[[\u00A0This sûrah\u00A0is named after the cow in this story, which happened at the time of Moses (ﷺ). A rich man was killed by his nephew, his only heir, and the body was thrown at the door of an innocent man. After a long investigation, no one was identified as the killer. Moses (ﷺ) prayed for guidance and was told that the only way to find the killer was to sacrifice a cow and strike the victim with a piece of it. When this was done, the victim spoke miraculously and said who the killer was.]]\u00A0They replied, “Are you mocking us?” Moses responded, “I seek refuge in Allah from acting foolishly!”",
  "They said, “Call upon your Lord to clarify for us what type ˹of cow˺ it should be!” He replied, “Allah says, ‘The cow should neither be old nor young but in between. So do as you are commanded!’”",
  "They said, “Call upon your Lord to specify for us its colour.” He replied, “Allah says, ‘It should be a bright yellow cow—pleasant to see.’”",
  "Again they said, “Call upon your Lord so that He may make clear to us which cow, for all cows look the same to us. Then, Allah willing, we will be guided ˹to the right one˺.”",
  "He replied, “Allah says, ‘It should have been used neither to till the soil nor water the fields; wholesome and without blemish.’” They said, “Now you have come with the truth.” Yet they still slaughtered it hesitantly!",
  "˹This is˺ when a man was killed and you disputed who the killer was, but Allah revealed what you concealed.",
  "So We instructed, “Strike the dead body with a piece of the cow.” This is how ˹easily˺ Allah brings the dead to life, showing you His signs so that you may understand.",
  "Even then your hearts became hardened like a rock or even harder, for some rocks gush rivers; others split, spilling water; while others are humbled in awe of Allah. And Allah is never unaware of what you do.",
  "Do you ˹believers still˺ expect them to be true to you, though a group of them would hear the word of Allah then knowingly corrupt it after understanding it?",
  "When they meet the believers they say, “We believe.” But in private they say ˹to each other˺, “Will you disclose to the believers the knowledge Allah has revealed to you,[[\u00A0i.e., verses prophesizing the coming of the Prophet (ﷺ) in the Torah (including Deuteronomy {18:15}-18 and {33:2}).]]\u00A0so that they may use it against you before your Lord? Do you not understand?”",
  "Do they not know that Allah is aware of what they conceal and what they reveal?",

  "So woe[[\u00A0i.e., warning of a curse or punishment.]]\u00A0to those who distort the Scripture with their own hands then say, “This is from Allah”—seeking a fleeting gain! So woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they have earned.",

  "But no! Those who commit evil and are engrossed in sin will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.",
  "And those who believe and do good will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever.",
  "And ˹remember˺ when We took a covenant from the children of Israel ˹stating˺, “Worship none but Allah; be kind to parents, relatives, orphans and the needy; speak kindly to people; establish prayer; and pay alms-tax.” But you ˹Israelites˺ turned away—except for a few of you—and were indifferent.",
  "And ˹remember˺ when We took your covenant that you would neither shed each other’s blood nor expel each other from their homes, you gave your pledge and bore witness.",
  "But here you are, killing each other and expelling some of your people from their homes, aiding one another in sin and aggression; and when those ˹expelled˺ come to you as captives, you still ransom them—though expelling them was unlawful for you.[[\u00A0The indigenous people of Medina were divided into two warring groups: Al-Aws\u00A0and Al-Khazraj. Some Jewish tribes were allied with the former and others with the latter, which meant that in times of war each of these Jewish tribes had to fight along with their allies against their enemies, including other Jews. When the Prophet (ﷺ) migrated to Medina, he brought about a lasting peace in the city.]]\u00A0Do you believe in some of the Scripture and reject the rest? Is there any reward for those who do so among you other than disgrace in this worldly life and being subjected to the harshest punishment on the Day of Judgment? For Allah is never unaware of what you do.",
  "These are the ones who trade the Hereafter for the life of this world. So their punishment will not be reduced, nor will they be helped.",
  "Indeed, We gave Moses the Book and sent after him successive messengers. And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the holy spirit.[[\u00A0The holy spirit is Gabriel, a mighty angel created from light, whose main duty is to communicate Allah’s messages to prophets.]]\u00A0Why is it that every time a messenger comes to you ˹Israelites˺ with something you do not like, you become arrogant, rejecting some and killing others?",
  "They say, “Our hearts are unreceptive!”[[\u00A0Their hearts are unreceptive because they claim they have enough knowledge already. ]]\u00A0In fact, Allah has condemned them for their disbelief. They have but little faith.",
  "Although they used to pray for victory ˹by means of the Prophet˺ over the polytheists,[[\u00A0lit., the disbelievers. ]]\u00A0when there came to them a Book from Allah which they recognized,[[\u00A0i.e., the Quran.]]\u00A0confirming the Scripture they had ˹in their hands˺, they rejected it. So may Allah’s condemnation be upon the disbelievers.",
  "Miserable is the price they have sold their souls for—denying Allah’s revelation and resenting Allah for granting His grace to whoever He wills of His servants! They have earned wrath upon wrath. And such disbelievers will suffer a humiliating punishment.",
  "When it is said to them: “Believe in what Allah has revealed,” they reply, “We only believe in what was sent down to us,” and they deny what came afterwards, though it is the truth confirming their own Scriptures! Ask ˹them, O \u00A0Prophet˺, “Why then did you kill Allah’s prophets before, if you are ˹truly˺ believers?”",
  "Indeed, Moses came to you with clear proofs, then you worshipped the calf in his absence, acting wrongfully.",
  "And when We took your covenant and raised the mountain above you ˹saying˺, “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and obey,” they answered, “We hear and disobey.” The love of the calf was rooted in their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “How evil is what your ˹so-called˺ belief prompts you to do, if you ˹actually˺ believe ˹in the Torah˺!”",
  "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter with Allah is exclusively for you ˹Israelites˺ out of all humanity, then wish for death if what you say is true!”",
  "But they will never wish for that because of what their hands have done.[[\u00A0i.e., disobeying Allah, killing some of the prophets (including Zachariah and John the Baptist), claiming to have killed Jesus, accusing Mary of adultery, and dealing with usury. See\u00A0{4:153}-158. ]]\u00A0And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers.",
  "You will surely find them clinging to life more eagerly than any other people, even more than polytheists. Each one of them wishes to live a thousand years. But even if they were to live that long, it would not save them from the punishment. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.",
  "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel should know that he revealed this ˹Quran˺ to your heart by Allah’s Will, confirming what came before it—a guide and good news for the believers.”",
  "Whoever is an enemy of Allah, His angels, His messengers, Gabriel, and Michael, then ˹let them know that˺ Allah is certainly the enemy of the disbelievers.",
  "Indeed, We have sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺ clear revelations. ˹But˺ none will deny them except the rebellious.",
  "Why is it that every time they make a covenant, a group of them casts it aside? In fact, most of them do not believe.",
  "Now, when a messenger from Allah has come to them—confirming their own Scriptures—some of the People of the Book cast the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know.",
  "They ˹instead˺ followed the magic promoted by the devils during the reign of Solomon. Never did Solomon disbelieve, rather the devils disbelieved. They taught magic to the people, along with what had been revealed to the two angels, Hârût and Mârût, in Babylon.[[\u00A0The two angels, Hârût and Mârût, were sent to enlighten the people in Babylon so they would not confuse magic tricks with miracles. Still some people abused this knowledge, causing mischief in the land. These practices persisted until the time of Solomon, who himself was falsely accused of utilizing magic to run his kingdom, subdue the jinn, and control the wind.]]\u00A0The two angels never taught anyone without saying, “We are only a test ˹for you˺, so do not abandon ˹your˺ faith.” Yet people learned ˹magic˺ that caused a rift ˹even˺ between husband and wife; although their magic could not harm anyone except by Allah’s Will. They learned what harmed them and did not benefit them—although they already knew that whoever buys into magic would have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed was the price for which they sold their souls, if only they knew!",
  "If only they were faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, there would have been a better reward from Allah, if only they knew!",

Do not say, “Râ’ina.” [Herd us!] But say, “Unẓurna,” [Tend to us!] and listen ˹attentively˺.[[\u00A0Some of the disbelievers used to \u00A0play with words when they addressed the Prophet (ﷺ) in order to ridicule him.

Better words are recommended.]]\u00A0And the disbelievers will suffer a painful punishment.",

The word “Muslim” means “one who submits to Allah.” All of the prophets submitted to Allah and were, therefore, Muslims.]]\u00A0and from our descendants a nation that will submit to you.

  "This was the advice of Abraham—as well as Jacob—to his children, ˹saying˺, “Indeed, Allah has chosen for you this faith; so do not die except in ˹a state of full˺ submission.”",
  "Or did you witness when death came to Jacob? He asked his children, “Who will you worship after my passing?” They replied, “We will ˹continue to˺ worship your God, the God of your forefathers—Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac—the One God. And to Him we ˹all˺ submit.”",
  "That was a community that had already gone before. For them is what they earned and for you is what you have earned. And you will not be accountable for what they have done.",

  "Those who swear not to have intercourse with their wives must wait for four months.[[\u00A0This ruling is called ilâ\u0027. Ilâ\u0027 means that a husband vows not to be intimate with his wife because of a dispute or any other legitimate reason. The verse here says if it is four months or less and the husband keeps his vow, then he does not have to make up for breaking his vow (by feeding ten poor people, or fasting three days), otherwise he will need to make up for breaking his vow. If the vow is made for over four months, the wife has the right to seek divorce after four months. Ilâ\u0027 should be avoided altogether since it deprives the wife of her right to sexual satisfaction. Instead, counselling is a better alternative at the time of dispute. ]]\u00A0If they change their mind, then Allah is certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",

If he chooses to stay with her after the first two counts of divorce then divorces her a third time, the marriage is terminated at the end of her third waiting period. The wife will have to marry and divorce another man before she can be remarried to her ex-husband (see\u00A0{2:230}).

  "O believers! When you contract a loan for a fixed period of time, commit it to writing. Let the scribe maintain justice between the parties. The scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught them to write. They will write what the debtor dictates, bearing Allah in mind and not defrauding the debt. If the debtor is incompetent, weak, or unable to dictate, let their guardian dictate for them with justice. Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness—so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her.[[\u00A0Generally speaking, there is a difference between witnessing and giving testimony before a judge. Verse {2:282} talks about witnessing a debt contract, not giving testimony. To fully understand the context of this verse, we need to keep in mind that 1500 years ago women did not normally participate in business transactions or travel with trading caravans and, therefore, not every woman had the expertise to witness a debt contract. Even if two women were available at the time of signing the contract, perhaps the primary witness might not be able to recall the details of the contract or appear before a judge because of compelling circumstances such as pregnancy or delivery. In any of these cases, the second woman will be a back-up. Some scholars maintain that one woman can be sufficient as a witness so long as she is reliable. As for giving testimony, a ruling can be made based on available testimony, regardless of the number or gender of the witnesses. For example, the beginning of Ramaḍân is usually confirmed by the sighting of the new moon, regardless of the gender of the person who sights the moon. Also the highest form of witness in Islam is for someone to testify they heard a narration (or ḥadîth) from the Prophet (ﷺ). An authentic ḥadîth\u00A0is accepted by all Muslims regardless of the gender of the narrator. Moreover, if a husband accuses his wife of adultery and he has no witnesses, each spouse must testify five times that they are telling the truth and the other side is lying. Both testimonies are equal (see\u00A0{24:6}-10). In some cases, only women’s testimony is accepted while men’s testimony is rejected, such as testifying regarding a woman’s pregnancy or virginity. ]]\u00A0The witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. You must not be against writing ˹contracts˺ for a fixed period—whether the sum is small or great. This is more just ˹for you˺ in the sight of Allah, and more convenient to establish evidence and remove doubts. However, if you conduct an immediate transaction among yourselves, then there is no need for you to record it, but call upon witnesses when a deal is finalized. Let no harm come to the scribe or witnesses. If you do, then you have gravely exceeded ˹your limits˺. Be mindful of Allah, for Allah ˹is the One Who˺ teaches you. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.",
  "If you are on a journey and a scribe cannot be found, then a security can be taken.

Abu Sufyân, commander of the Meccan army, sent a man to discourage the Muslims from following the Meccans. Although the man falsely claimed that the Meccans were mobilizing to launch a decisive attack on Medina, the Prophet became more determined to chase them away.

Unlike any previous faith, Islam puts a limit on the number of wives a man can have. Under certain circumstances, a Muslim man may marry up to four wives as long as he is able to provide for them and maintain justice among them—otherwise it is unlawful. With the exception of Jesus Christ and John the Baptist (neither of whom were married), almost all religious figures in the Bible had more than one wife. According to the Bible, Solomon (ﷺ) had 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kings {11:3}) and his father, David (ﷺ), had many wives and concubines (2 Samuel {5:13}). ]]\u00A0or those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession.[[\u00A0A bondwoman is a female slave that a man owned either through purchase or taking her captive in war—a common ancient practice in many parts of the world. Islam opened the door for ending slavery by making it an act of charity to free slaves. Many sins (such as breaking one’s oath, unintentional killing, and intercourse with one’s wife during the day of fasting in Ramaḍân) can be atoned by freeing a slave. According to Islamic teachings, no free person can be enslaved. Islam also improved the condition of slaves. It was unlawful to separate a mother from her child. Children born to a slave-master were deemed free, and their mother would gain her freedom upon the death of her master. With regards to slaves, Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ) says, “Feed them from what you eat, clothe them from what you wear, and do not overwhelm them with work unless you assist them.” He (ﷺ) also says, “Whoever kills his slave will be killed and whoever injures his slave will be injured.” In recent times, slavery has been outlawed in all countries—including the Muslim world. ]]\u00A0This way you are less likely to commit injustice.",

If she is a daughter, she will get half of the share of her brother, since he—unlike his sister—has to provide for the family and pay a dowry at the time of his marriage. More than a male’s share. For example, if a man leaves $24 000 and six sons, two brothers, a wife, and a mother. The wife will get one-eighth ($3000), the mother one-sixth ($4000), each of the sons will receive about $2 833 and the two brothers will not get anything. An equal share. This is in the case of siblings from the mother’s side (mentioned in verse 12 of this sûrah). ]]\u00A0If you leave only two ˹or more˺ females, their share is two-thirds of the estate. But if there is only one female, her share will be one-half. Each parent is entitled to one-sixth if you leave offspring.[[\u00A0Offspring” here means any number of children—male or female.]]\u00A0But if you are childless and your parents are the only heirs, then your mother will receive one-third.[[\u00A0And the father will take the rest of the estate.]]\u00A0But if you leave siblings, then your mother will receive one-sixth[[\u00A0Although the existence of siblings reduces the mother’s share from one-third to one-sixth, siblings themselves do not receive a share of inheritance and the rest of the estate goes to the father. ]]—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts.[[\u00A0Debts as well as any other financial obligations (such as funeral expenses, unfulfilled vows, or unpaid dowry) have to be repaid before the fulfilment of bequests, then the estate can be distributed among the heirs.

But if you have children, then your wives will receive one-eighth of your estate—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts.

But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,[[\u00A0The verse discusses a group of people who nominally became Muslims and secretly supported the enemies of Muslims.

And whoever kills a believer unintentionally must free a believing slave and pay blood-money to the victim’s family—unless they waive it charitably. But if the victim is a believer from a hostile people, then a believing slave must be freed. And if the victim is from a people bound with you in a treaty, then blood-money must be paid to the family along with freeing a believing slave. Those who are unable, let them fast two consecutive months—as a means of repentance to Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",

  "When you ˹O Prophet˺ are ˹campaigning˺ with them and you lead them in prayer, let one group of them pray with you—while armed. When they prostrate themselves, let the other group stand guard behind them.

  "O \u00A0my people! Enter the Holy Land which Allah has destined for you ˹to enter˺. And do not turn back or else you will become losers.”",
  "They replied, “O Moses! There is an enormously powerful people there, so we will never ˹be able to˺ enter it until they leave. If they do, then we will enter!”",
  "Two God-fearing men—who had been blessed by Allah—said, “Surprise them through the gate. If you do, you will certainly prevail. Put your trust in Allah if you are ˹truly˺ believers.”",
  "˹Yet˺ they said, “O Moses! ˹Still˺ we will never enter as long as they remain there. So go—both you and your Lord—and fight; we are staying right here!”",
  "Moses pleaded, “My Lord! I have no control over anyone except myself and my brother. So set us apart from the rebellious people.”",
  "Allah replied, “Then this land is forbidden to them for forty years, during which they will wander through the land. So do not grieve for the rebellious people.”",
  "Relate to them in truth ˹O Prophet˺ the story of Adam’s two sons—how each offered a sacrifice: Abel’s offering was accepted while Cain’s was not. So Cain threatened, “I will kill you!” His brother replied, “Allah only accepts ˹the offering˺ of the sincerely devout.",
  "If you raise your hand to kill me, I will not raise mine to kill you, because I fear Allah—the Lord of all worlds.",
  "I want to let you bear your sin against me along with your other sins, then you will be one of those destined to the Fire. And that is the reward of the wrongdoers.”",
  "Yet Cain convinced himself to kill his brother, so he killed him—becoming a loser.",
  "Then Allah sent a crow digging ˹a grave˺ in the ground ˹for a dead crow˺, in order to show him how to bury the corpse of his brother. He cried, “Alas! Have I ˹even˺ failed to be like this crow and bury the corpse of my brother?” So he became regretful.[[\u00A0In Islam, regret for doing something wrong is essential for repentance. But in the case of Cain, his regret was not for killing his brother, but for failing to bury his corpse to hide the evidence of his crime. Therefore, his regret was not intended as a step towards repentance. ]]\u00A0",
  "That is why We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever takes a life—unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity.[[\u00A0Although this is addressed to the Children of Israel, it is applicable to everyone at all times. ]]\u00A0˹Although˺ Our messengers already came to them with clear proofs, many of them still transgressed afterwards through the land.",
  "Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land. This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.[[\u00A0This ruling (called ḥirâbah) applies to crimes committed by armed individuals or groups against civilians—Muslim or non-Muslim. Different punishments apply depending on the severity of the crime:In the case of murder or rape, offenders are to be executed.In the case of armed robbery, offenders’ right hands and left feet are to be cut off.In the case of terrorizing innocent people, offenders are to be jailed in exile.Penalties for lesser offences are left for the judge to decide. ]]",
  "As for those who repent before you seize them, then know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
  "O believers! Be mindful of Allah and seek what brings you closer to Him and struggle in His Way, so you may be successful.",
  "As for the disbelievers, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over ˹and offer it all˺ to ransom themselves from the punishment of the Day of Judgment, it would never be accepted from them. And they will suffer a painful punishment.",
  "They will be desperate to get out of the Fire but they will never be able to. And they will suffer an everlasting punishment.",
  "As for male and female thieves, cut off their hands for what they have done—a deterrent from Allah. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.[[\u00A0In Islam, strict conditions must be met for punishments to be carried out. For example, for someone to be punished for theft, the thief must be a sane adult who knows that theft is forbidden, the crime has to be proven either by confession or the testimony of two reliable eyewitnesses, the stolen item has to be of value and taken secretly from a safe place, and the owner has to claim it. Otherwise, the punishment is not applied. Islamic punishments apply neither in non-Muslim countries nor in Muslim countries where Sharî’ah\u00A0is not fully applied. Moreover, the punishment is only applicable in a society where the needs of the poor are adequately met (i.e., they receive alms-tax, charity, or welfare) and where theft is more out of desire than necessity. It is worth mentioning that ’Umar ibn Al-Khaṭṭâb, Islam’s 2nd\u00A0Caliph, suspended this punishment for one year due to widespread famine.]]",
  "But whoever repents after their wrongdoing and mends their ways, Allah will surely turn to them in forgiveness. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
  "Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah ˹alone˺? He punishes whoever He wills and forgives whoever He wills. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.",
  "O Messenger! Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—those who say, “We believe” with their tongues, but their hearts are in disbelief. Nor those among the Jews who eagerly listen to lies, attentive to those who are too arrogant to come to you. They distort the Scripture, taking rulings out of context, then say, “If this is the ruling you get ˹from Muḥammad˺, accept it. If not, beware!” Whoever Allah allows to be deluded, you can never be of any help to them against Allah. It is not Allah’s Will to purify their hearts. For them is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.",
  "They eagerly listen to falsehood and consume forbidden gain.[[\u00A0i.e., bribes and interest.]]\u00A0So if they come to you ˹O Prophet˺, either judge between them or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they cannot harm you whatsoever. But if you judge between them, then do so with justice. Surely Allah loves those who are just.",
  "But why do they come to you for judgment when they ˹already˺ have the Torah containing Allah’s judgment, then they turn away after all? They are not ˹true˺ believers.",
  "Indeed, We revealed the Torah, containing guidance and light, by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, made judgments for Jews. So too did the rabbis and scholars judge according to Allah’s Book, with which they were entrusted and of which they were made keepers. So do not fear the people; fear Me! Nor trade my revelations for a fleeting gain. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the disbelievers.",
  "We ordained for them in the Torah, “A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth—and for wounds equal retaliation.” But whoever waives it charitably, it will be atonement for them. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the wrongdoers.",
  "Then in the footsteps of the prophets, We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah—a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.",
  "So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed in it. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the rebellious.",
  "We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ this Book with the truth, as a confirmation of previous Scriptures and a supreme authority on them. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires over the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have ordained a code of law and a way of life. If Allah had willed, He would have made you one community, but His Will is to test you with what He has given ˹each of˺ you. So compete with one another in doing good. To Allah you will all return, then He will inform you ˹of the truth˺ regarding your differences.",
  "And judge between them ˹O Prophet˺ by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires. And beware, so they do not lure you away from some of what Allah has revealed to you. If they turn away ˹from Allah’s judgment˺, then know that it is Allah’s Will to repay them for some of their sins, and that many people are indeed rebellious.",
  "Is it the judgment of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance they seek? Who could be a better judge than Allah for people of sure faith?",
  "O believers! Take neither Jews nor Christians as guardians—they are guardians of each other.[[\u00A0Wali\u00A0means guardian, caretaker, protector, provider, ally, etc. The Prophet (ﷺ) for example says, “A woman should not get married without a wali.”—that is a guardian such as her father to represent her in the marriage and make sure she receives her full rights. The verse forbids Muslims from allying with the Jews and Christians (or anyone else) conspiring to persecute Muslims. On the other hand, as long as non-Muslims are not at war with Muslims or persecuting them, the Quran ({60:8}) commands Muslims to be kind and gracious to them. ]]\u00A0Whoever does so will be counted as one of them. Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",
  "You see those with sickness in their hearts racing for their guardianship, saying ˹in justification˺, “We fear a turn of fortune will strike us.” But perhaps Allah will bring about ˹your˺ victory or another favour by His command, and they will regret what they have hidden in their hearts.",
  "˹Only then,˺ the believers will ask ˹one another˺, “Are these the ones who swore solemn oaths by Allah that they were with you?” Their deeds have been in vain, so they have become losers.",
  "O believers! Whoever among you abandons their faith, Allah will replace them with others who love Him and are loved by Him. They will be humble with the believers but firm towards the disbelievers, struggling in the Way of Allah; fearing no blame from anyone. This is the favour of Allah. He grants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.",
  "Your only guardians are Allah, His Messenger, and fellow believers—who establish prayer and pay alms-tax\u00A0with humility.",
  "Whoever allies themselves with Allah, His Messenger, and fellow believers, then it is certainly Allah’s party that will prevail.",
  "O believers! Do not seek the guardianship of those given the Scripture before you and the disbelievers who have made your faith a mockery and amusement. And be mindful of Allah if you are ˹truly˺ believers.",
  "When you call to prayer, they mock it in amusement. This is because they are a people without understanding.",
  "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! Do you resent us only because we believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed before—while most of you are rebellious?”",
  "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Shall I inform you of those who deserve a worse punishment from Allah ˹than the rebellious˺? It is those who earned Allah’s condemnation and displeasure—some being reduced to apes and pigs[[\u00A0Literally or metaphorically.

  "˹Some among˺ the Jews said, “Allah is tight-fisted.”[[\u00A0lit., Allah’s Hand is tied up ˹with greed˺. ]]\u00A0May their fists be tied and they be condemned for what they said. Rather, He is open-handed, giving freely as He pleases. That which has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ from your Lord will only cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief. We have stirred among them hostility and hatred until the Day of Judgment. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, Allah puts it out. And they strive to spread corruption in the land. And Allah does not like corruptors.",
  "Had the People of the Book only been faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, We would have certainly absolved them of their sins and admitted them into the Gardens of Bliss.",

You have nothing to stand on unless you observe the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.” And your Lord’s revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ will only cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief.

  "Indeed, the believers, Jews, Sabians[[\u00A0See\u00A0footnote for {2:62}. ]]\u00A0and Christians—whoever ˹truly˺ believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.",
  "Indeed, We took a covenant from the Children of Israel and sent them messengers. Whenever a messenger came to them with what they did not desire, they denied some and killed others.",
  "They thought there would be no consequences, so they turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. Yet Allah turned to them in forgiveness ˹after their repentance˺, but again many became blind and deaf. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.",
  "Those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have certainly fallen into disbelief. The Messiah ˹himself˺ said, “O Children of Israel! Worship Allah—my Lord and your Lord.” Whoever associates others with Allah ˹in worship˺ will surely be forbidden Paradise by Allah. Their home will be the Fire. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers.",
  "Those who say, “Allah is one in a Trinity,” have certainly fallen into disbelief. There is only One God. If they do not stop saying this, those who disbelieve among them will be afflicted with a painful punishment.",
  "Will they not turn to Allah in repentance and seek His forgiveness? And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
  "The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. ˹Many˺ messengers had ˹come and˺ gone before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They both ate food.[[\u00A0i.e., they were in need of food for nourishment. According to some scholars, this implies that Jesus and his mother had to relieve themselves after the food had been digested. Almighty Allah is far above depending on food or having to go to the restroom.]]\u00A0See how We make the signs clear to them, yet see how they are deluded ˹from the truth˺!",

  "The disbelievers among the Children of Israel were condemned in the revelations of David and Jesus, son of Mary. That was for their disobedience and violations.",
  "They did not forbid one another from doing evil. Evil indeed was what they did!",
  "You see many of them taking the disbelievers[[\u00A0i.e., the pagans.]]\u00A0as allies. Truly wicked are their misdeeds, which have earned them Allah’s wrath. And they will be in everlasting torment.",

  "Eat of the good, lawful things provided to you by Allah. And be mindful of Allah in Whom you believe.",
  "Allah will not call you to account for your thoughtless oaths, but He will hold you accountable for deliberate oaths. The penalty for a broken oath is to feed ten poor people from what you normally feed your own family, or to clothe them, or to free a bondsperson. But if none of this is affordable, then you must fast three days. This is the penalty for breaking your oaths. So be mindful of your oaths. This is how Allah makes things clear to you, so perhaps you will be grateful.",
  "O believers! Intoxicants, gambling, idols, and drawing lots for decisions[[\u00A0See\u00A0footnote for {5:3}.]]\u00A0are all evil of Satan’s handiwork. So shun them so you may be successful.",

  "There is no blame on those who believe and do good for what they had consumed before ˹the prohibition˺, as long as they fear Allah, have faith, and do what is good; then they believe and act virtuously, then become fully mindful ˹of Allah˺ and do righteous deeds.

  "O believers! Allah will surely test you with game within the reach of your hands and spears to distinguish those who fear Him in secret. Whoever transgresses from now on will suffer a painful punishment.",
  "O \u00A0believers! Do not kill game while on pilgrimage. Whoever kills game intentionally must compensate by offering its equivalence—as judged by two just men among you—to be offered at the Sacred House, or by feeding the needy, or by fasting so that they may taste the consequences of their violations. Allah has forgiven what has been done. But those who persist will be punished by Allah. And Allah is Almighty, capable of punishment.",
  "It is lawful for you to hunt and eat seafood, as a provision for you and for travellers. But hunting on land is forbidden to you while on pilgrimage. Be mindful of Allah to Whom you all will be gathered.",

  "O believers! Do not ask about any matter which, if made clear to you, may disturb you. But if you inquire about what is being revealed in the Quran, it will be made clear to you.

  "But no! ˹They only say this˺ because the truth they used to hide will become all too clear to them. Even if they were to be sent back, they would certainly revert to what they were forbidden. Indeed they are liars!",
  "They insisted, “There is nothing beyond this worldly life and we will never be resurrected.”",
  "But if only you could see when they will be detained before their Lord! He will ask ˹them˺, “Is this ˹Hereafter˺ not the truth?” They will cry, “Absolutely, by our Lord!” He will say, “Then taste the punishment for your disbelief.”",
  "Losers indeed are those who deny the meeting with Allah until the Hour takes them by surprise, then they will cry, “Woe to us for having ignored this!” They will bear ˹the burden of˺ their sins on their backs. Evil indeed is their burden!",
  "This worldly life is no more than play and amusement, but far better is the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?",

  "Only the attentive will respond ˹to your call˺. As for the dead, Allah will raise them up, then to Him they will ˹all˺ be returned.",
  "They ask, “Why has no ˹other˺ sign been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah certainly has the power to send down a sign”—though most of them do not know.",
  "All living beings roaming the earth and winged birds soaring in the sky are communities like yourselves.[[\u00A0Allah has created living beings (like animals, birds, and fish) just like He created human beings.

  "Why did they not humble themselves when We made them suffer? Instead, their hearts were hardened, and Satan made their misdeeds appealing to them.",

  "Who does more wrong than the one who fabricates lies against Allah or claims, “I have received revelations!”—although nothing was revealed to them—or the one who says, “I can reveal the like of Allah’s revelations!”?

Historically, the Bible was not translated into Arabic until centuries after the Prophet (ﷺ). Even if an Arabic translation of the Bible existed at his time, he (ﷺ) could not have copied it because he could not read or write. From an Islamic point of view, similarities stem from the fact that both scriptures came originally from the same source—divine revelation. For more details, see\u00A0the Introduction.]]\u00A0and We make this ˹Quran˺ clear for people who know.",

  "Had Allah willed, they would not have been polytheists. We have not appointed you as their keeper, nor are you their maintainer.",
  "˹O believers!˺ Do not insult what they invoke besides Allah or they will insult Allah spitefully out of ignorance. This is how We have made each people’s deeds appealing to them. Then to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them of what they used to do.",
  "They swear by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a sign were to come to them, they would certainly believe in it. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Signs are only with Allah.” What will make you ˹believers˺ realize that even if a sign were to come to them, they still would not believe?",
  "We turn their hearts and eyes away ˹from the truth˺ as they refused to believe at first, leaving them to wander blindly in their defiance.",
  "Even if We had sent them the angels, made the dead speak to them, and assembled before their own eyes every sign ˹they demanded˺, they still would not have believed—unless Allah so willed. But most of them are ignorant ˹of this˺.",
  "And so We have made for every prophet enemies—devilish humans and jinn—whispering to one another with elegant words of deception. Had it been your Lord’s Will, they would not have done such a thing. So leave them and their deceit,",

  "Do not eat of what is not slaughtered in Allah’s Name. For that would certainly be ˹an act of˺ disobedience.

  "Can those who had been dead, to whom We gave life and a light with which they can walk among people, be compared to those in complete darkness from which they can never emerge?[[\u00A0The Quran often compares disbelief to death and blindness whereas belief is compared to life and the ability to see.]]\u00A0That is how the misdeeds of the disbelievers have been made appealing to them.",

And fulfil your covenant with Allah. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will be mindful.",
  "Indeed, that is My Path—perfectly straight. So follow it and do not follow other ways, for they will lead you away from His Way. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will be conscious ˹of Allah˺.”",

  "But they rejected him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and drowned those who rejected Our signs. They were certainly a blind people.",
  "And to the people of ’Âd We sent their brother Hûd. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. Will you not then fear Him?”",
  "The disbelieving chiefs of his people responded, “We surely see you as a fool, and we certainly think you are a liar.”",

  "They said, “Have you come to us so that we would worship Allah alone and abandon what our forefathers used to worship? Then bring us what you threaten us with, if what you say is true!”",
  "He said, “You will certainly be subjected to your Lord’s torment and wrath. Do you dispute with me regarding the so-called gods which you and your forefathers have made up—a practice Allah has never authorized? Then wait! I too am waiting with you.”",
  "So We saved him and those with him by Our mercy and uprooted those who denied Our signs. They were not believers.",
  "And to the people of Thamûd We sent their brother Ṣâliḥ. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. A clear proof has come to you from your Lord: this is Allah’s she-camel as a sign to you. So leave her to graze ˹freely˺ on Allah’s land and do not harm her, or else you will be overcome by a painful punishment.",
  "Remember when He made you successors after ’Âd and established you in the land—˹and˺ you built palaces on its plains and carved homes into mountains. So remember Allah’s favours, and do not go about spreading corruption in the land.”",
  "The arrogant chiefs of his people asked the lowly who believed among them, “Are you certain that Ṣâliḥ has been sent by his Lord?” They replied, “We certainly believe in what he has been sent with.”",

  "Then they killed the she-camel—defying their Lord’s command—and challenged ˹Ṣâliḥ˺, “Bring us what you threaten us with, if you are ˹truly˺ one of the messengers.”",
  "Then an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them, and they fell lifeless in their homes.",
  "So he turned away from them, saying, “O my people! Surely I conveyed to you my Lord’s message and gave you ˹sincere˺ advice, but you do not like ˹sincere˺ advisors.”",
  "And ˹remember˺ when Lot scolded ˹the men of˺ his people, ˹saying,˺ “Do you commit a shameful deed that no man has ever done before?",
  "You lust after men instead of women! You are certainly transgressors.”",
  "But his people’s only response was to say, “Expel them from your land! They are a people who wish to remain chaste!”",
  "So We saved him and his family except his wife, who was one of the doomed.",
  "We poured upon them a rain ˹of brimstone˺. See what was the end of the wicked!",
  "And to the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu’aib. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. A clear proof has already come to you from your Lord. So give just measure and weight, do not defraud people of their property, nor spread corruption in the land after it has been set in order. This is for your own good, if you are ˹truly˺ believers.",
  "And do not lie in ambush on every road—threatening and hindering those who believe in Allah from His Path and striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked. Remember when you were few, then He increased you in number. And consider the fate of the corruptors!",

  "The arrogant chiefs of his people threatened, “O Shu’aib! We will certainly expel you and your fellow believers from our land, unless you return to our faith.” He replied, “Even if we hate it?",
  "We would surely be fabricating a lie against Allah if we were to return to your faith after Allah has saved us from it. It does not befit us to return to it unless it is the Will of Allah, our Lord. Our Lord has encompassed everything in ˹His˺ knowledge. In Allah we trust. Our Lord! Judge between us and our people with truth. You are the best of those who judge.”",
  "The disbelieving chiefs of his people threatened, “If you follow Shu’aib, you will surely be losers!”",
  "Then an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them and they fell lifeless in their homes.",
  "Those who rejected Shu’aib were ˹wiped out˺ as if they had never lived there. Those who rejected Shu’aib were the true losers.",
  "He turned away from them, saying, “O my people! Indeed, I have delivered to you the messages of my Lord and gave you ˹sincere˺ advice. How can I then grieve for those who chose to disbelieve?”",
  "Whenever We sent a prophet to a society, We afflicted its ˹disbelieving˺ people with suffering and adversity, so perhaps they would be humbled.",
  "Then We changed their adversity to prosperity until they flourished and argued ˹falsely˺, “Our forefathers ˹too˺ had been visited by adversity and prosperity.”[[\u00A0They argued that life has its ups and downs and, therefore, they did not perceive adversity as a punishment or prosperity as a test—arguing that the same thing happened to their ancestors. ]]\u00A0So We seized them by surprise, while they were unaware.",
  "Had the people of those societies been faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, We would have overwhelmed them with blessings from heaven and earth. But they disbelieved, so We seized them for what they used to commit.",
  "Did the people of those societies feel secure that Our punishment would not come upon them by night while they were asleep?",
  "Or did they feel secure that Our punishment would not come upon them by day while they were at play?",
  "Did they feel secure against Allah’s planning? None would feel secure from Allah’s planning except the losers.",
  "Is it not clear to those who take over the land after ˹the destruction of˺ its former residents that—if We will—We can punish them ˹too˺ for their sins and seal their hearts so they will not hear ˹the truth˺?",
  "We have narrated to you ˹O Prophet˺ some of the stories of those societies. Surely, their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but still they would not believe in what they had already denied. This is how Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers.",
  "We did not find most of them true to their covenant. Rather, We found most of them truly rebellious.",
  "Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. See what was the end of the corruptors!",
  "And Moses said, “O Pharaoh! I am truly a messenger from the Lord of all worlds,",
  "obliged to say nothing about Allah except the truth. Indeed, I have come to you with clear proof from your Lord, so let the children of Israel go with me.”",
  "Pharaoh said, “If you have come with a sign, then bring it if what you say is true.”",
  "So Moses threw down his staff and—behold!—it became a real snake.",
  "Then he drew his hand ˹out of his collar˺ and it was ˹shining˺ white for all to see.",
  "The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, “He is indeed a skilled magician,",
  "who seeks to drive you from your land.” ˹So Pharaoh asked,˺ “What do you propose?”",
  "They replied, “Let him and his brother wait and send mobilizers to all cities",
  "to bring you every clever magician.”",
  "The magicians came to Pharaoh, saying, “Shall we receive a ˹suitable˺ reward if we prevail?”",
  "He replied, “Yes, and you will certainly be among those closest to me.”",
  "They asked, “O Moses! Will you cast, or shall we be the first to cast?”",
  "Moses said, “You first.” So when they did, they deceived the eyes of the people, stunned them, and made a great display of magic.",
  "Then We inspired Moses, “Throw down your staff,” and—behold!—it devoured the objects of their illusion!",
  "So the truth prevailed and their illusions failed.",
  "So Pharaoh and his people were defeated right there and put to shame.",
  "And the magicians fell down, prostrating.",
  "They declared, “We ˹now˺ believe in the Lord of all worlds—",
  "the Lord of Moses and Aaron.”",
  "Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? This must be a conspiracy you devised in the city to drive out its people, but soon you will see.",
  "I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.”",
  "They responded, “Surely to our Lord we will ˹all˺ return.",
  "Your rage towards us is only because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us. Our Lord! Shower us with perseverance, and let us die while submitting ˹to You˺.”[[\u00A0lit., as Muslims.]]\u00A0",
  "The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people protested, “Are you going to leave Moses and his people free to spread corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods?” He responded, “We will kill their sons and keep their women.[[\u00A0As we did before the birth of Moses. ]]\u00A0We will completely dominate them.”",
  "Moses reassured his people, “Seek Allah’s help and be patient. Indeed, the earth belongs to Allah ˹alone˺. He grants it to whoever He chooses of His servants. The ultimate outcome belongs ˹only˺ to the righteous.”",
  "They complained, “We have always been oppressed—before and after you came to us ˹with the message˺.” He replied, “Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land to see what you will do.”",
  "Indeed, We afflicted Pharaoh’s people with famine and shortage of crops so they might come back ˹to their senses˺.",
  "In times of prosperity, they said, “This is what we deserve,” but in adversity, they blamed it on Moses and those with him.[[\u00A0In psychology, this is called self-serving bias and scapegoating.]]\u00A0Surely all is destined by Allah. Yet most of them did not know.",
  "They said, “No matter what sign you may bring to deceive us, we will never believe in you.”",
  "So We plagued them with floods, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood—all as clear signs, but they persisted in arrogance and were a wicked people.",
  "When tormented, they pleaded, “O Moses! Pray to your Lord on our behalf, by virtue of the covenant He made with you. If you help remove this torment from us, we will certainly believe in you and let the Children of Israel go with you.”",
  "But as soon as We removed the torment from them—until they met their inevitable fate[[\u00A0i.e., their drowning in the sea.]]—they broke their promise.",
  "So We inflicted punishment upon them, drowning them in the sea for denying Our signs and being heedless of them.",
  "And ˹so˺ We made the oppressed people successors of the eastern and western lands, which We had showered with blessings. ˹In this way˺ the noble Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel for what they had endured. And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people constructed and what they established.",
  "We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came upon a people devoted to idols. They demanded, “O Moses! Make for us a god like their gods.” He replied, “Indeed, you are a people acting ignorantly!",
  "What they follow is certainly doomed to destruction and their deeds are in vain.”",
  "He added, “Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah, while He has honoured you above the others?”",
  "And ˹remember˺ when We rescued you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment—killing your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord.",
  "We appointed for Moses thirty nights then added another ten—completing his Lord’s term of forty nights. Moses commanded his brother Aaron, “Take my place among my people, do what is right, and do not follow the way of the corruptors.”",
  "When Moses came at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he asked, “My Lord! Reveal Yourself to me so I may see You.” Allah answered, “You cannot see Me! But look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, only then will you see Me.” When his Lord appeared to the mountain, He levelled it to dust and Moses collapsed unconscious. When he recovered, he cried, “Glory be to You! I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.”",
  "Allah said, “O Moses! I have ˹already˺ elevated you above all others by My messages and speech.[[\u00A0Allah reminds Moses that even though his request to see Allah was denied, he has already been favoured by Allah over the people of his time through prophethood and direct communication with the Almighty. ]]\u00A0So hold firmly to what I have given you and be grateful.”",
  "We wrote for him on the Tablets ˹the fundamentals˺ of everything; commandments and explanations of all things. ˹We commanded,˺ “Hold to this firmly and ask your people to take the best of it.[[\u00A0To follow the commandments that generate more rewards than others, to put grace before justice, etc. ]]\u00A0I will soon show ˹all of˺ you the home of the rebellious.[[\u00A0This could either mean the ruins of destroyed nations or the Hellfire which is the home of the wicked. ]]",
  "I will turn away from My signs those who act unjustly with arrogance in the land. And even if they were to see every sign, they still would not believe in them. If they see the Right Path, they will not take it. But if they see a crooked path, they will follow it. This is because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.",
  "The deeds of those who deny Our signs and the meeting ˹with Allah˺ in the Hereafter will be in vain. Will they be rewarded except for what they have done?”",
  "In the absence of Moses, his people made from their ˹golden˺ jewellery an idol of a calf that made a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to the ˹Right˺ Path? Still they took it as a god and were wrongdoers.",
  "Later, when they were filled with remorse and realized they had gone astray, they cried, “If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we will certainly be losers.”",
  "Upon Moses’ return to his people, ˹totally˺ furious and sorrowful, he said, “What an evil thing you committed in my absence! Did you want to hasten your Lord’s torment?” Then he threw down the Tablets and grabbed his brother by the hair, dragging him closer. Aaron pleaded, “O son of my mother! The people overpowered me and were about to kill me. So do not ˹humiliate me and˺ make my enemies rejoice, nor count me among the wrongdoing people.”",
  "Moses prayed, “My Lord! Forgive me and my brother! And admit us into Your mercy. You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”",
  "Those who worshipped the calf will certainly be afflicted with Allah’s wrath as well as disgrace in the life of this world. This is how We reward those who invent falsehood.",
  "But those who commit evil, then repent and become ˹true˺ believers, your Lord will certainly be All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.",
  "When Moses’ anger subsided, he took up the Tablets whose text contained guidance and mercy for those who stand in awe of their Lord.",
  "Moses chose seventy men from among his people for Our appointment and, when they were seized by an earthquake,[[\u00A0For asking Moses to make Allah visible to them.]]\u00A0he cried, “My Lord! Had You willed, You could have destroyed them long ago, and me as well. Will You destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This is only a test from You—by which You allow whoever you will to stray and guide whoever You will. You are our Guardian. So forgive us and have mercy on us. You are the best forgiver.",
  "Ordain for us what is good in this life and the next. Indeed, we have turned to You ˹in repentance˺.” Allah replied, “I will inflict My torment on whoever I will. But My mercy encompasses everything. I will ordain mercy for those who shun evil, pay alms-tax, and believe in Our revelations.",
  "“˹They are˺ the ones who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whose description they find in their Torah and the Gospel.[[\u00A0Some Muslim scholars cite Deuteronomy {18:15}-18 and {33:2}, Isaiah 42, and John {14:16} as examples of the description of Prophet Muḥammad in the Bible. However, Bible scholars interpret these verses differently. The name of Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ) appears several times in the Gospel of Barnabas, which is deemed apocryphal by Christian authorities. ]]\u00A0He commands them to do good and forbids them from evil, permits for them what is lawful and forbids to them what is impure, and relieves them from their burdens and the shackles that bound them. ˹Only˺ those who believe in him, honour and support him, and follow the light sent down to him will be successful.”",
  "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! I am Allah’s Messenger to you all. To Him ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He gives life and causes death.” So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah and His revelations. And follow him, so you may be ˹rightly˺ guided.",
  "There are some among the people of Moses who guide with the truth and establish justice accordingly.",
  "We divided them into twelve tribes—each as a community. And We revealed to Moses, when his people asked for water, “Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed out. Each tribe knew its drinking place. We shaded them with clouds and sent down to them manna and quails,[[\u00A0Manna (heavenly bread) and quails (chicken-like birds) sustained the children of Israel in the wilderness after they left Egypt.]]\u00A0˹saying˺, “Eat from the good things We have provided for you.” They ˹certainly˺ did not wrong Us, but wronged themselves.",
  "And ˹remember˺ when it was said to them, “Enter this city ˹of Jerusalem˺ and eat from wherever you please. Say, ‘Absolve us,’ and enter the gate with humility. We will forgive your sins, ˹and˺ We will multiply the reward for the good-doers.”",
  "But the wrongdoers among them changed the words they were commanded to say. So We sent down a punishment from the heavens upon them for their wrongdoing.",
  "Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ about ˹the people of˺ the town which was by the sea, who broke the Sabbath.[[\u00A0The people of Aylah, an ancient town by the Red Sea, were forbidden to catch fish on the Sabbath. However, on Saturdays fish were everywhere, whereas on weekdays no fish were seen. To get around the prohibition, some decided to lay their nets on Fridays and collect the fish caught in their nets on Sundays. Those opposed to this practice were divided into two groups: one group tried to convince the offenders to honour the Sabbath, but soon gave up when their advice was not taken seriously. The second group was persistent in giving advice to the Sabbath-breakers. Eventually, the Sabbath-breakers were punished whereas the other two groups were saved. ]]\u00A0During the Sabbath, ˹abundant˺ fish would come to them clearly visible, but on other days the fish were never seen. In this way We tested them for their rebelliousness.",
  "When some of ˹the righteous among˺ them questioned ˹their fellow Sabbath-keepers˺, “Why do you ˹bother to˺ warn those ˹Sabbath-breakers˺ who will either be destroyed or severely punished by Allah?” They replied, “Just to be free from your Lord’s blame, and so perhaps they may abstain.”",
  "When they ignored the warning they were given, We rescued those who used to warn against evil and overtook the wrongdoers with a dreadful punishment for their rebelliousness.",
  "But when they stubbornly persisted in violation, We said to them, “Be disgraced apes!”[[\u00A0Literally or metaphorically. See\u00A0footnote for {2:65}.]]\u00A0",
  "And ˹remember, O \u00A0Prophet,˺ when your Lord declared that He would send against them others who would make them suffer terribly until the Day of Judgment. Indeed, your Lord is swift in punishment, but He is certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
  "We dispersed them through the land in groups—some were righteous, others were less so. We tested them with prosperity and adversity, so perhaps they would return ˹to the Right Path˺.",
  "Then they were succeeded by other generations who inherited the Scripture. They indulged in unlawful gains, claiming, “We will be forgiven ˹after all˺.” And if similar gain came their way, they would seize it. Was a covenant not taken from them in the Scripture that they would not say anything about Allah except the truth? And they were already well-versed in its teachings. But the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?",
  "As for those who firmly abide by the Scripture and establish prayer—surely We never discount the reward of those acting righteously.",
  "And ˹remember˺ when We raised the mountain over them as if it were a cloud and they thought it would fall on them.[[\u00A0The mountain was raised over their heads when Moses came to them with the teachings of the Torah and was met with defiance. So the mountain was raised as a miracle and a display of Allah’s infinite power over them. ]]\u00A0˹We said,˺ “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which\u00A0We have given you and observe its teachings so perhaps you will become mindful ˹of Allah˺.”",
  "And ˹remember˺ when your Lord brought forth from the loins of the children of Adam their descendants and had them testify regarding themselves. ˹Allah asked,˺ “Am I not your Lord?” They replied, “Yes, You are! We testify.” ˹He cautioned,˺ “Now you have no right to say on Judgment Day, ‘We were not aware of this.’",
  "Nor say, ‘It was our forefathers who had associated others ˹with Allah in worship˺ and we, as their descendants, followed in their footsteps. Will you then destroy us for the falsehood they invented?’”",
  "This is how We make our signs clear, so perhaps they will return ˹to the Right Path˺.",
  "And relate to them ˹O Prophet˺ the story of the one to whom We gave Our signs, but he abandoned them, so Satan took hold of him, and he became a deviant.[[\u00A0Bal’am ibn Ba’ûrâ\u0027 was a scholar who lived at the time of Moses (ﷺ) but later deviated from the truth.]]",
  "If We had willed, We would have elevated him with Our signs, but he clung to this life—following his evil desires. His example is that of a dog: if you chase it away, it pants, and if you leave it, it ˹still˺ pants. This is the example of the people who deny Our signs.[[\u00A0Regardless of whether they are warned or not, still they will not believe.]]\u00A0So narrate ˹to them˺ stories ˹of the past˺, so perhaps they will reflect.",
  "What an evil example of those who denied Our signs! They ˹only˺ wronged their own souls.",
  "Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. And whoever He leaves to stray, they are the ˹true˺ losers.",
  "Indeed, We have destined many jinn and humans for Hell. They have hearts they do not understand with, eyes they do not see with, and ears they do not hear with. They are like cattle. In fact, they are even less guided! Such ˹people˺ are ˹entirely˺ heedless.",
  "Allah has the Most Beautiful Names. So call upon Him by them, and keep away from those who abuse His Names.[[\u00A0Those who twist Allah’s Names then use them to call false gods. For example, Allât, a name of one of the idols was derived from Allah\u00A0(the One God), Al-’Uzza\u00A0was derived from Al-’Azîz\u00A0(the Almighty), and Manât\u00A0was derived from Al-Mannân\u00A0(the Bestower).]]\u00A0They will be punished for what they used to do.",
  "And among those We created is a group that guides with the truth and establishes justice accordingly.",
  "As for those who deny Our signs, We will gradually draw them to destruction in ways they cannot comprehend.",
  "I ˹only˺ delay their end for a while, but My planning is flawless.",
  "Have they not ever given it a thought? Their fellow man[[\u00A0i.e., Muḥammad (ﷺ).]]\u00A0is not insane. He is only sent with a clear warning.",
  "Have they ever reflected on the wonders of the heavens and the earth, and everything Allah has created, and that perhaps their end is near? So what message after this ˹Quran˺ would they believe in?",
  "Whoever Allah allows to stray, none can guide, leaving them to wander blindly in their defiance.",
  "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the Hour, “When will it be?” Say, “That knowledge is only with my Lord. He alone will reveal it when the time comes. It is too tremendous for the heavens and the earth and will only take you by surprise.” They ask you as if you had full knowledge of it. Say, “That knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know.”",
  "Say, “I have no power to benefit or protect myself, except by the Will of Allah. If I had known the unknown, I would have benefited myself enormously, and no harm would have ever touched me. I am only a warner and deliverer of good news for those who believe.”",
  "He is the One Who created you from a single soul, then from it made its spouse so he may find comfort in her. After he had been united with her, she carried a light burden that developed gradually. When it grew heavy, they prayed to Allah, their Lord, “If you grant us good offspring, we will certainly be grateful.”",
  "But when He granted their descendants good offspring, they associated false gods in what He has given them. Exalted is Allah above what they associate ˹with Him˺!",
  "Do they associate ˹with Allah˺ those ˹idols˺ which cannot create anything, but are in fact created;",
  "which cannot help them, or even help themselves?",
  "And if you ˹idolaters˺ call upon them for guidance, they cannot respond to you. It is all the same whether you call them or remain silent.",
  "Those ˹idols˺ you invoke besides Allah are created beings like yourselves. So call upon them and see if they will answer you, if your claims are true!",
  "Do they have feet to walk with? Or hands to hold with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Call upon your associate-gods and conspire against me without delay!",
  "“Indeed, my Protector is Allah Who has revealed this Book. For He ˹alone˺ protects the righteous.",
  "But those ˹false gods˺ you call besides Him can neither help you nor even themselves.”",
  "If you ˹idolaters˺ call them to guidance, they cannot hear. And you ˹O Prophet˺ may see them facing towards you, but they cannot see.",
  "Be gracious, enjoin what is right, and turn away from those who act ignorantly.",
  "If you are tempted by Satan, then seek refuge with Allah. Surely He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
  "Indeed, when Satan whispers to those mindful ˹of Allah˺, they remember ˹their Lord˺ then they start to see ˹things˺ clearly.",
  "But the devils persistently plunge their ˹human˺ associates[[\u00A0lit., their brothers.]]\u00A0deeper into wickedness, sparing no effort.",
  "If you ˹O Prophet˺ do not bring them a sign ˹which they demanded˺, they ask, “Why do you not make it yourself?” Say, “I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord. This ˹Quran˺ is an insight from your Lord—a guide and a mercy for those who believe.”",
  "When the Quran is recited, listen to it attentively and be silent, so you may be shown mercy.",
  "Remember your Lord inwardly with humility and reverence and in a moderate tone of voice, both morning and evening. And do not be one of the heedless.",
  "Surely those ˹angels˺ nearest to your Lord are not too proud to worship Him. They glorify Him. And to Him they prostrate.",
  "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the spoils of war. Say, “Their distribution is decided by Allah and His Messenger. So be mindful of Allah, settle your affairs, and obey Allah and His Messenger if you are ˹true˺ believers.”",
  "The ˹true˺ believers are only those whose hearts tremble at the remembrance of Allah, whose faith increases when His revelations are recited to them, and who put their trust in their Lord.",
  "˹They are˺ those who establish prayer and donate from what We have provided for them.",
  "It is they who are the true believers. They will have elevated ranks, forgiveness, and an honourable provision from their Lord.",
  "Similarly, when your Lord brought you ˹O Prophet˺ out of your home for a just cause, a group of believers was totally against it.",
  "They disputed with you about the truth after it had been made clear, as if they were being driven to death with their eyes wide open.",
  "˹Remember, O \u00A0believers,˺ when Allah promised ˹to give˺ you the upper hand over either target, you wished to capture the unarmed party.[[\u00A0After many years of persecution in Mecca, the Prophet (ﷺ) and many of his early followers decided to emigrate secretly to Medina, about 250 miles to the north, leaving behind their homes and valuables, which were soon taken over by the pagans of Mecca. To avenge \u00A0this financial loss, the Prophet (ﷺ) decided to capture an unarmed Meccan trade caravan headed by Abu Sufyân, a Meccan chief. Eventually, the caravan escaped, but the Meccans mobilized an army of over 1000 well-armed soldiers, more than three times the size of the Muslim force. Many Muslims had hoped to capture the caravan without having to meet the Meccan army in battle. Although the Muslims were vastly outnumbered and lightly-armed, they still won this decisive battle. ]]\u00A0But it was Allah’s Will\u00A0to establish the truth by His Words and uproot the disbelievers;",
  "to firmly establish the truth and wipe out falsehood—even to the dismay of the wicked.",
  "˹Remember˺ when you cried out to your Lord for help, He answered, “I will reinforce you with a thousand angels—followed by many others.”[[\u00A0Five thousand angels in total, as mentioned in {3:125}. ]]",
  "And Allah made this a sign of victory and reassurance to your hearts. Victory comes only from Allah. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
  "˹Remember˺ when He caused drowsiness to overcome you, giving you serenity.[[\u00A0This happened the night before the battle. ]]\u00A0And He sent down rain from the sky to purify you, free you from Satan’s whispers, strengthen your hearts, and make ˹your˺ steps firm.",
  "˹Remember, O \u00A0Prophet,˺ when your Lord revealed to the angels, “I am with you. So make the believers stand firm. I will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.”",
  "This is because they defied Allah and His Messenger. And whoever defies Allah and His Messenger, then ˹know that˺ Allah is surely severe in punishment.",
  "That ˹worldly punishment˺ is yours, so taste it! Then the disbelievers will suffer the torment of the Fire.",
  "O believers! When you face the disbelievers in battle, never turn your backs to them.",
  "And whoever does so on such an occasion—unless it is a manoeuvre or to join their own troops—will earn the displeasure of Allah, and their home will be Hell. What an evil destination!",
  "It was not you ˹believers˺ who killed them, but it was Allah Who did so. Nor was it you ˹O Prophet˺ who threw ˹a handful of sand at the disbelievers˺,[[\u00A0Before the battle, the Prophet (ﷺ) threw a handful of sand at the disbelievers and prayed for their defeat. ]]\u00A0but it was Allah Who did so, rendering the believers a great favour. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
  "As such, Allah frustrates the evil plans of the disbelievers.",
  "If you ˹Meccans˺ sought judgment, now it has come to you. And if you cease, it will be for your own good. But if you persist, We will persist. And your forces—no matter how numerous they might be—will not benefit you whatsoever. For Allah is certainly with the believers.",
  "O believers! Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from him while you hear ˹his call˺.",
  "Do not be like those who say, “We hear,” but in fact they are not listening.",
  "Indeed, the worst of all beings in the sight of Allah are the ˹wilfully˺ deaf and dumb, who do not understand.[[\u00A0This refers metaphorically to the disbelievers who fail to see and hear the truth.]]",
  "Had Allah known any goodness in them, He would have certainly made them hear. ˹But˺ even if He had made them hear, they would have surely turned away heedlessly.",
  "O believers! Respond to Allah and His Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life. And know that Allah stands between a person and their heart, and that to Him you will all be gathered.",
  "Beware of a trial that will not only affect the wrongdoers among you. And know that Allah is severe in punishment.",
  "Remember when you had been vastly outnumbered and oppressed in the land,[[\u00A0i.e., Mecca.]]\u00A0constantly in fear of attacks by your enemy, then He sheltered you, strengthened you with His help, and provided you with good things so perhaps you would be thankful.",
  "O believers! Do not betray Allah and the Messenger, nor betray your trusts knowingly.",
  "And know that your wealth and your children are only a test and that with Allah is a great reward.",
  "O believers! If you are mindful of Allah, He will grant you a standard ˹to distinguish between right and wrong˺, absolve you of your sins, and forgive you. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.",
  "And ˹remember, O \u00A0Prophet,˺ when the disbelievers conspired to capture, kill, or exile you. They planned, but Allah also planned. And Allah is the best of planners.",
  "Whenever Our revelations are recited to them, they challenge ˹you˺, “We have already heard ˹the recitation˺. If we wanted, we could have easily produced something similar. This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but ancient fables!”",
  "And ˹remember˺ when they prayed, “O Allah! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones upon us from the sky or overcome us with a painful punishment.”",
  "But Allah would never punish them while you ˹O Prophet˺ were in their midst. Nor would He ever punish them if they prayed for forgiveness.",
  "And why should Allah not punish them while they hinder pilgrims from the Sacred Mosque, claiming to be its rightful guardians? None has the right to guardianship except those mindful ˹of Allah˺, but most pagans do not know.",
  "Their prayer at the Sacred House was nothing but whistling and clapping. So taste the punishment for your disbelief.",
  "Surely the disbelievers spend their wealth to hinder others from the Path of Allah. They will continue to spend to the point of regret. Then they will be defeated and the disbelievers will be driven into Hell,",
  "so Allah may separate the evil from the good. He will pile up the evil ones all together and then cast them into Hell. They are the ˹true˺ losers.",
  "Tell the disbelievers that if they desist, their past will be forgiven. But if they persist, then they have an example in those destroyed before them.",
  "Fight against them until there is no more persecution—and ˹your˺ devotion will be entirely to Allah. But if they desist, then surely Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.",
  "And if they do not comply, then know that Allah is your Protector. What an excellent Protector, and what an excellent Helper!",
  "Know that whatever spoils you take, one-fifth is for Allah and the Messenger, his close relatives, orphans, the poor, and ˹needy˺ travellers, if you ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and what We revealed to Our servant on that decisive day when the two armies met ˹at Badr˺. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.",
  "˹Remember˺ when you were on the near side of the valley, your enemy on the far side, and the caravan was below you. Even if the two armies had made an appointment ˹to meet˺, both would have certainly missed it.[[\u00A0The battle was not planned since the Muslim force was after the caravan. Had the two armies made plans to meet in battle at that time and place, they both probably would have missed each other. ]]\u00A0Still it transpired so Allah may establish what He had destined—that those who were to perish and those who were to survive might do so after the truth had been made clear to both. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
  "˹Remember, O \u00A0Prophet,˺ when Allah showed them in your dream as few in number. Had He shown them to you as many, you ˹believers˺ would have certainly faltered and disputed in the matter. But Allah spared you ˹from that˺. Surely He knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.",
  "Then when your armies met, Allah made them appear as few in your eyes, and made you appear as few in theirs, so Allah may establish what He had destined. And to Allah ˹all˺ matters will be returned ˹for judgment˺.",
  "O believers! When you face an enemy, stand firm and remember Allah often so you may triumph.",
  "Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not dispute with one another, or you would be discouraged and weakened. Persevere! Surely Allah is with those who persevere.",
  "Do not be like those ˹pagans˺ who left their homes arrogantly, only to be seen by people and to hinder others from Allah’s Path. And Allah is Fully Aware of what they do.",
  "And ˹remember˺ when Satan made their ˹evil˺ deeds appealing to them, and said, “No one can overcome you today. I am surely by your side.” But when the two forces faced off, he cowered and said, “I have absolutely nothing to do with you. I certainly see what you do not see. I truly fear Allah, for Allah is severe in punishment.”",
  "˹Remember˺ when the hypocrites and those with sickness in their hearts said, “These ˹believers˺ are deluded by their faith.” But whoever puts their trust in Allah, surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
  "If only you could see when the angels take the souls of the disbelievers, beating their faces and backs, ˹saying,˺ “Taste the torment of burning!",
  "This is ˹the reward˺ for what your hands have done. And Allah is never unjust to ˹His˺ creation.”",
  "Their fate is that of the people of Pharaoh and those before them—they all disbelieved in Allah’s signs, so Allah seized them for their sins. Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful, severe in punishment.",
  "This is because Allah would never discontinue His favour to a people until they discontinue their faith. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
  "That was the case with Pharaoh’s people and those before them—they all rejected the signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them for their sins and drowned Pharaoh’s people. They were all wrongdoers.",
  "Indeed, the worst of all beings in the sight of Allah are those who persist in disbelief, never to have faith—",
  "˹namely˺ those with whom you ˹O Prophet˺ have entered into treaties, but they violate them every time, not fearing the consequences.",
  "If you ever encounter them in battle, make a fearsome example of them, so perhaps those who would follow them may be deterred.",
  "And if you ˹O Prophet˺ see signs of betrayal by a people, respond by openly terminating your treaty with them. Surely Allah does not like those who betray.",
  "Do not let those disbelievers[[\u00A0Who survived the Battle of Badr. ]]\u00A0think they are not within reach. They will have no escape.",
  "Prepare against them what you ˹believers˺ can of ˹military˺ power and cavalry to deter Allah’s enemies and your enemies as well as other enemies unknown to you but known to Allah. Whatever you spend in the cause of Allah will be paid to you in full and you will not be wronged.",
  "If the enemy is inclined towards peace, make peace with them. And put your trust in Allah. Indeed, He ˹alone˺ is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
  "But if their intention is only to deceive you, then Allah is certainly sufficient for you. He is the One Who has supported you with His help and with the believers.",
  "He brought their hearts together. Had you spent all the riches in the earth, you could not have united their hearts. But Allah has united them. Indeed, He is Almighty, All-Wise.",
  "O \u00A0Prophet! Allah is sufficient for you and for the believers who follow you.",
  "O Prophet! Motivate the believers to fight. If there are twenty steadfast among you, they will overcome two hundred. And if there are one hundred of you, they will overcome one thousand of the disbelievers, for they are a people who do not comprehend.",
  "Now Allah has lightened your burden, for He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there are a hundred steadfast among you, they will overcome two hundred. And if there be one thousand, they will overcome two thousand, by Allah’s Will. And Allah is with the steadfast.",
  "It is not fit for a prophet that he should take captives until he has thoroughly subdued the land. You ˹believers˺ settled with the fleeting gains of this world,[[\u00A0i.e., ransom. ]]\u00A0while Allah’s aim ˹for you˺ is the Hereafter. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
  "Had it not been for a prior decree from Allah,[[\u00A0The decree that ransoming captives will be allowed. ]]\u00A0you would have certainly been disciplined with a tremendous punishment for whatever ˹ransom˺ you have taken.",
  "Now enjoy what you have taken, for it is lawful and good. And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
  "O Prophet! Tell the captives in your custody, “If Allah finds goodness in your hearts, He will give you better than what has been taken from you, and forgive you. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”",
  "But if their intention is only to betray you ˹O Prophet˺, they sought to betray Allah before. But He gave you power over them. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
  "Those who believed, emigrated, and strived with their wealth and lives in the cause of Allah, as well as those who gave them shelter and help—they are truly guardians of one another. As for those who believed but did not emigrate, you have no obligations to them until they emigrate. But if they seek your help ˹against persecution˺ in faith, it is your obligation to help them, except against people bound with you in a treaty. Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.",
  "As for the disbelievers, they are guardians of one another. And unless you ˹believers˺ act likewise, there will be great oppression and corruption in the land.",
  "Those who believed, migrated, and struggled in the cause of Allah, and those who gave ˹them˺ shelter and help, they are the true believers. They will have forgiveness and an honourable provision.",
  "And those who later believed, migrated, and struggled alongside you, they are also with you. But only blood relatives are now entitled to inherit from one another,\u00A0as ordained by Allah. Surely Allah has ˹full˺ knowledge of everything.[[\u00A0This verse ended a previous ruling that allowed inheritance between Muslims from Mecca (Al-Muhâjirûn, the Emigrants) and Muslims from Medina (Al-Anṣâr, the Helpers). Now, only relatives can inherit from one another, whereas non-heirs can receive a share through bequest, up to one third of the estate. See\u00A0{4:7}, 11-13, 32-33, and 176. ]]",
  "˹This is˺ a discharge from all obligations,[[\u00A0This sûrah, which is perceived as a continuation of the previous sûrah, begins by openly terminating the peace treaties constantly violated by the pagans. The believers are urged to march forth with the Prophet (ﷺ) for the Battle of Tabûk in the summer of 9 A.H./631 C.E. Hypocrites are exposed and their false excuses are refuted. Muslims are reminded of how Allah turned the believers’ initial defeat into sweeping victory at the Battle of Ḥunain and how Allah saved His Messenger (ﷺ) from the pagans during his migration to Medina. Allah’s acceptance of repentance is echoed throughout the sûrah, hence its title.]]\u00A0by Allah and His Messenger, to the polytheists you ˹believers˺ have entered into treaties with:",

Since this constitutes a declaration of war, it would not be fitting to open with the mention of Allah’s compassion and mercy.]]",
  "A declaration from Allah and His Messenger ˹is made˺ to all people on the day of the greater pilgrimage[[\u00A0The 10th\u00A0of Ⱬul-Ḥijjah, a significant day in the greater pilgrimage (ḥajj).

The treaty was violated by the Meccans in 8 A.H/630 C.E. ]]\u00A0So, as long as they are true to you, be true to them. Indeed Allah loves those who are mindful ˹of Him˺.",

  "They do not honour the bonds of kinship or treaties with the believers. It is they who are the transgressors.",

  "Do you ˹pagans˺ consider providing the pilgrims with water and maintaining the Sacred Mosque as equal to believing in Allah and the Last Day and struggling in the cause of Allah? They are not equal in Allah’s sight. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",
  "Those who have believed, emigrated, and strived in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives are greater in rank in the sight of Allah. It is they who will triumph.",

  "O believers! Do not take your parents and siblings as trusted allies if they choose disbelief over belief. And whoever of you does so, they are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers.",
  "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If your parents and children and siblings and spouses and extended family and the wealth you have acquired and the trade you fear will decline and the homes you cherish—˹if all these˺ are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and struggling in His Way, then wait until Allah brings about His Will. Allah does not guide the rebellious people.”",
  "Indeed Allah has given you ˹believers˺ victory on many battlefields, even at the Battle of Ḥunain[[\u00A0After the Muslims’ victory in Mecca in 8 A.H/630 C.E., almost all Arab tribes pledged allegiance to the Prophet (ﷺ) except some tribes such as Hawâzin and Thaqîf. Both tribes decided to attack the Muslims, so the Prophet (ﷺ) led an army of 12 000 soldiers to attack the two tribes. Since that was the largest Muslim army ever mobilized, some Muslims expressed their conviction that such an army could not be defeated. However, on the way to battle, the Muslim army was ambushed and most soldiers fled, except for the Prophet (ﷺ) and a few loyalists. Eventually, the Muslims were re-organized and won a decisive battle. ]]\u00A0when you took pride in your great numbers, but they proved of no advantage to you. The earth, despite its vastness, seemed to close in on you, then you turned back in retreat.",
  "Then Allah sent down His reassurance[[\u00A0lit., tranquility. ]]\u00A0upon His Messenger and the believers, and sent down forces[[\u00A0i.e., angels. ]]\u00A0you could not see, and punished those who disbelieved. Such was the reward of the disbelievers.",
  "Then afterwards Allah will turn in grace to whoever He wills.[[\u00A0i.e., Allah will accept those who embrace Islam. Almost all of Arabia became Muslim before the death of Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ) in 11 A.H./632 C.E. ]]\u00A0And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",

  "Fight those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, nor comply with what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, nor embrace the religion of truth from among those who were given the Scripture,[[\u00A0To fully understand this verse we need to bear in mind that Quranic verses are of two types. General verses talk about belief in Allah, good manners, and acts of worship. Specific verses, such\u00A0as this verse, were revealed in regards to particular situations. This sûrah\u00A0came at a time when the pagans of Arabia (and their allies) repeatedly violated treaties they had signed with the Prophet (ﷺ). Muslims had to fight for the survival of their newly established state in Medina. So this verse discusses dealing with those who violated their agreements and attacked the Muslims. Offenders were fought, unless they stopped their aggression. If they chose not to accept Islam, they were obligated to pay Jizya-tax.]]\u00A0until they pay the tax,[[\u00A0Taxation systems have existed since ancient times. There are several references in the Old Testament (e.g., Ezra {4:20}). In the New Testament, Jesus allows paying taxes to Caesar (Luke {20:25}). Under Islamic rule, all individuals had financial obligations—Muslims paid zakâh\u00A0(2.5% of their savings) and non-Muslims (ⱬimmîs) were required to pay jizyah\u00A0(tax for protection from foreign enemies). The jizyah\u00A0was an average of one dinar (4.25 g of gold) annually. Women, children, the elderly, the clergy, the poor, and those who were unable to work were exempt. Those who opted to join the army were also exempt. Poor ⱬimmîs\u00A0were supported financially by the state. Muslim rulers refunded the jizyah\u00A0if they failed to protect their non-Muslim subjects.]]\u00A0willingly submitting, fully humbled.",
  "The Jews say, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” while the Christians say, “The Messiah is the son of Allah.” Such are their baseless assertions, only parroting the words of earlier disbelievers. May Allah condemn them! How can they be deluded ˹from the truth˺?",
  "They have taken their rabbis and monks as well as the Messiah, son of Mary, as lords besides Allah,[[\u00A0When ’Adi ibn Ḥâtim, a companion of the Prophet (ﷺ), heard this verse, he said, “But the Jews and Christians do not worship their rabbis and monks!” The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, “Do the rabbis and monks not forbid the permissible and permit the forbidden, and they obey them?” ’Adi answered, “Yes, they do.” The Prophet (ﷺ) concluded, “This is how they worship them.” Collected by At-Tirmiⱬi.]]\u00A0even though they were commanded to worship none but One God.

  "Reallocating the sanctity of ˹these˺ months[[\u00A0The sacred months are the 11th, 12th, 1st, and 7th\u00A0of the Islamic calendar.

They adjust the sanctity one year and uphold it in another, only to maintain the number of months sanctified by Allah, violating the very months Allah has made sacred. Their evil deeds have been made appealing to them. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.",
  "O believers! What is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of Allah, you cling firmly to ˹your˺ land?[[\u00A0The fast pace of the spread of Islam in Arabia in the 7th\u00A0century was intimidating to the world’s two superpowers of that time: the Romans and Persians. The Prophet (ﷺ) received the news that a Roman army was being mobilized to launch an attack on the newly established Muslim state in Medina, so he announced that he was going to march to Tabûk, located over 700 miles to the north, to meet the Romans in the summer of 9 A.H./631 C.E. It was a time of hardship because of the scorching heat, the long distance, and the financial situation of the Muslims. Although the Prophet (ﷺ) was able to mobilize over 30 000 Muslims for battle, many others did not join the army with or without valid excuses. Eventually, the Roman forces were discouraged from fighting and fled to Damascus and other cities under Roman rule. Therefore, the Prophet (ﷺ) returned to Medina with a feeling of triumph. With a new power now emerging in Arabia, many tribes started to switch their alliances from Caesar to the Prophet (ﷺ). ]]\u00A0Do you prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter? The enjoyment of this worldly life is insignificant compared to that of the Hereafter.",

  "˹It does not matter˺ if you ˹believers˺ do not support him, for Allah did in fact support him when the disbelievers drove him out ˹of Mecca˺ and he was only one of two.

He accompanied the Prophet (ﷺ) during his emigration from Mecca to Medina after years of persecution at the hands of the Meccan pagans. ]]\u00A0“Do not worry; Allah is certainly with us.” So Allah sent down His serenity upon the Prophet, supported him with forces you ˹believers˺ did not see, and made the word of the disbelievers lowest, while the Word of Allah is supreme.

  "No one would ask for exemption except those who have no faith in Allah or the Last Day, and whose hearts are in doubt, so they are torn by their doubts.",
  "Had they ˹really˺ intended to march forth, they would have made preparations for it. But Allah disliked that they should go, so He let them lag behind, and it was said ˹to them˺, “Stay with those ˹helpless˺ who remain behind.”",

The new mosque, commonly referred to as Masjid Aḍ-Ḍirâr\u00A0(Mosque of Harm), was intended to attract other hypocrites and reduce the number of Muslims who prayed at Qubâ\u0027. The hypocrites who built the mosque also anticipated the arrival of Abu ’Âmer with Roman forces to expel the Prophet (ﷺ) and Muslims out of Medina. Upon a request from these hypocrites, the Prophet (ﷺ) had planned to visit the new mosque once he returned from Tabûk, but verses 107-110 of this sûrah\u00A0were revealed, warning the Prophet (ﷺ) against that mosque.

  "˹Consider˺ the Day We will gather them all together then say to those who associated others ˹with Allah in worship˺, “Stay in your places—you and your associate-gods.” We will separate them from each other, and their associate-gods will say, “It was not us that you worshipped!",

Jonah’s people became convinced that they were going to be destroyed when he left them and they saw signs of the imminent torment, so they felt remorseful and cried out for forgiveness before the coming of the punishment. Therefore, Allah accepted their repentance and the torment was retracted. ]]\u00A0When they believed, We lifted from them the torment of disgrace in this world and allowed them enjoyment for a while.[[\u00A0i.e., until the end of their term. ]]\u00A0",

  "And it was said, “O earth! Swallow up your water. And O \u00A0sky! Withhold ˹your rain˺.” The floodwater receded and the decree was carried out. The Ark rested on Mount Judi, and it was said, “Away with the wrongdoing people!”",
  "Noah called out to his Lord, saying, “My Lord! Certainly my son is ˹also˺ of my family, Your promise is surely true, and You are the most just of all judges!”",
  "Allah replied, “O Noah! He is certainly not of your family—he was entirely of unrighteous conduct. So do not ask Me about what you have no knowledge of! I warn you so you do not fall into ignorance.”",
  "Noah pleaded, “My Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking You about what I have no knowledge of, and unless You forgive me and have mercy on me, I will be one of the losers.”",
  "It was said, “O Noah! Disembark with Our peace and blessings on you and some of the descendants of those with you. As for the others, We will allow them ˹a brief˺ enjoyment, then they will be touched with a painful punishment from Us.”",
  "This is one of the stories of the unseen, which we reveal to you ˹O Prophet˺. Neither you nor your people knew it before this. So be patient! Surely the ultimate outcome belongs ˹only˺ to the righteous.",
  "And to the people of ’Âd We sent their brother Hûd. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. You do nothing but fabricate lies ˹against Allah˺.",
  "O \u00A0my people! I do not ask you for any reward for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from the One Who created me. Will you not then understand?",
  "And O \u00A0my people! Seek your Lord’s forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance. He will shower you with rain in abundance, and add strength to your strength. So do not turn away, persisting in wickedness.”",
  "They argued, “O Hûd! You have not given us any clear proof, and we will never abandon our gods upon your word, nor will we believe in you.",
  "All we can say is that some of our gods have possessed you with evil.” He said, “I call Allah to witness, and you too bear witness, that I ˹totally˺ reject whatever you associate",
  "with Him ˹in worship˺. So let all of you plot against me without delay!",
  "I have put my trust in Allah—my Lord and your Lord. There is no living creature that is not completely under His control.[[\u00A0lit., there is no moving creature that He does not hold by its forelock. ]]\u00A0Surely my Lord’s Way is perfect justice.[[\u00A0lit., my Lord is on the Straight Path.]]",
  "But if you turn away, I have already delivered to you what I have been sent with. My Lord will replace you with others. You are not harming Him in the least. Indeed, my Lord is a ˹vigilant˺ Keeper over all things.”",
  "When Our command came, We rescued Hûd and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us, saving them from a harsh torment.",
  "That was ’Âd. They denied the signs of their Lord, disobeyed His messengers, and followed the command of every stubborn tyrant.",
  "They were followed by a curse in this world, as they will be on the Day of Judgment. Surely ’Âd denied their Lord. So away with ’Âd, the people of Hûd.",
  "And to the people of Thamûd We sent their brother Ṣâliḥ. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. He ˹is the One Who˺ produced you from the earth and settled you on it. So seek His forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance. Surely my Lord is Ever Near, All-Responsive ˹to prayers˺.”",
  "They argued, “O Ṣâliḥ! We truly had high hopes in you before this.[[\u00A0They believed that Ṣâliḥ had the potential to be their future leader.\u00A0]]\u00A0How dare you forbid us to worship what our forefathers had worshipped? We are certainly in alarming doubt about what you are inviting us to.”",
  "He responded, “O my people! Consider if I stand on a clear proof from my Lord and He has blessed me with a mercy from Him. Who could help me against Allah if I were to disobey Him? You would only contribute to my doom.",
  "And O \u00A0my people! This she-camel of Allah is a sign for you.[[\u00A0The she-camel came out of a mountain as a sign for them. ]]\u00A0So leave her to graze ˹freely˺ on Allah’s earth and do her no harm, or a swift punishment will overtake you!”",
  "But they killed her, so he warned ˹them˺, “You have ˹only˺ three ˹more˺ days to enjoy life in your homes—this is an unfailing promise!”",
  "When Our command came, We saved Ṣâliḥ and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us and spared them the disgrace of that Day. Surely your Lord ˹alone˺ is the All-Powerful, Almighty.",
  "And the ˹mighty˺ blast overtook the wrongdoers, so they fell lifeless in their homes,",
  "as if they had never lived there. Surely Thamûd denied their Lord, so away with Thamûd!",
  "And surely Our messenger-angels came to Abraham with good news ˹of a son˺. They greeted ˹him with˺, “Peace!” And he replied, “Peace ˹be upon you˺!” Then it was not long before he brought ˹them˺ a ˹fat,˺ roasted calf.",
  "And when he saw that their hands did not reach for the food, he became suspicious and fearful of them.[[\u00A0In ancient Middle Eastern culture, if a guest refused to eat the food provided by their host, it was a sign of ill-will. ]]\u00A0They reassured ˹him˺, “Do not be afraid! We are ˹angels˺ sent ˹only˺ against the people of Lot.”",
  "And his wife was standing by, so she laughed,[[\u00A0She laughed after her husband was assured that the guests intended no harm or when she heard the news of the imminent destruction of the sinful people of Lot. ]]\u00A0then We gave her good news of ˹the birth of˺ Isaac, and, after him, Jacob.",
  "She wondered, “Oh, my! How can I have a child in this old age, and my husband here is an old man? This is truly an astonishing thing!”",
  "They responded, “Are you astonished by Allah’s decree? May Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you, O \u00A0people of this house. Indeed, He is Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.”",
  "Then after the fear had left Abraham, and the good news had reached him, he began to plead with Us for the people of Lot.",
  "Truly, Abraham was forbearing, tender-hearted, and ever turning ˹to his Lord˺.",
  "˹The angels said,˺ “O Abraham! Plead no more! Your Lord’s decree has already come, and they will certainly be afflicted with a punishment that cannot be averted!”",
  "When Our messenger-angels came to Lot, he was distressed and worried by their arrival.[[\u00A0Since the angels came in the form of handsome men, Lot was worried for the dignity and safety of his guests among his people—not knowing that they were angels. ]]\u00A0He said, “This is a terrible day.”",
  "And ˹the men of˺ his people—who were used to shameful deeds—came to him rushing. He pleaded, “O my people! Here are my daughters[[\u00A0Single women of his community.]]\u00A0˹for marriage˺—they are pure for you. So fear Allah, and do not humiliate me by disrespecting my guests. Is there not ˹even˺ a single right-minded man among you?”",
  "They argued, “You certainly know that we have no need for your daughters. You already know what we desire!”",
  "He responded, “If only I had the strength ˹to resist you˺ or could rely on a strong supporter.”",
  "The angels said, “O Lot! We are the messengers of your Lord. They will never reach you. So travel with your family in the dark of night, and do not let any of you look back, except your wife. She will certainly suffer the fate of the others.[[\u00A0Lot’s wife disbelieved in his message. It is believed that she is the one who informed the people of Lot’s handsome guests. ]]\u00A0Their appointed time is the morning. Is the morning not near?”",
  "When Our command came, We turned the cities upside down and rained down on them clustered stones of baked clay,",

  "And to the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu’aib. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. And do not give short measure and weight. I do see you in prosperity now, but I truly fear for you the torment of an overwhelming Day.",

  "So seek your Lord’s forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance. Surely my Lord is Most Merciful, All-Loving.”",
  "They threatened, “O Shu’aib! We do not comprehend much of what you say, and surely we see you powerless among us. Were it not for your clan, we would have certainly stoned you, for you are nothing to us.”",

  "So do not be in doubt ˹O Prophet˺ about what those ˹pagans˺ worship. They worship nothing except what their forefathers worshipped before ˹them˺. And We will certainly give them their share ˹of punishment˺ in full, without any reduction.",

  "Indeed, in the story of Joseph and his brothers there are lessons for all who ask.",
  "˹Remember˺ when they said ˹to one another˺, “Surely Joseph and his brother ˹Benjamin˺ are more beloved to our father than we, even though we are a group of so many.[[\u00A0Unlike Joseph’s other brothers, Benjamin was Joseph’s full brother. They lost their mother at a young age, so their half-brothers thought that their father loved them more.]]\u00A0Indeed, our father is clearly mistaken.",

  "They said, “O our father! Why do you not trust us with Joseph, although we truly wish him well?",
  "Send him out with us tomorrow so that he may enjoy himself and play. And we will really watch over him.”",
  "He responded, “It would truly sadden me if you took him away with you, and I fear that a wolf may devour him while you are negligent of him.”",
  "They said, “If a wolf were to devour him, despite our strong group, then we would certainly be losers!”",
  "And so, when they took him away and decided to throw him into the bottom of the well, We inspired him: “˹One day˺ you will remind them of this deed of theirs while they are unaware ˹of who you are˺.”",
  "Then they returned to their father in the evening, weeping.",
  "They cried, “Our father! We went racing and left Joseph with our belongings, and a wolf devoured him! But you will not believe us, no matter how truthful we are.”",
  "And they brought his shirt, stained with false blood.[[\u00A0They stained Joseph’s shirt with blood from a sheep, but forgot to tear his shirt. So Jacob became suspicious when he saw the intact shirt. ]]\u00A0He responded, “No! Your souls must have tempted you to do something ˹evil˺. So ˹I can only endure with˺ beautiful patience![[\u00A0i.e., patience without complaining. ]]\u00A0It is Allah’s help that I seek to bear your claims.”",
  "And there came some travellers, and they sent their water-boy who let down his bucket into the well. He cried out, “Oh, what a great find! Here is a boy!” And they took him secretly ˹to be sold˺ as merchandise, but Allah is All-Knowing of what they did.",
  "They ˹later˺ sold him for a cheap price, just a few silver coins—only wanting to get rid of him.[[\u00A0Other possible translations: 1. “… so little did they value him.” 2. “… they had no interest in him.” In any case, they wanted to sell him immediately before someone claimed him. According to some Quran commentators, it was Joseph’s brothers who sold him to the travellers after he was picked up from the well. The verse states that Joseph was sold for a few worthless coins. Ironically, in {12:88} Joseph’s brothers came to him after he became Egypt’s Chief Minister, begging for supplies and saying that the only money they could afford was a few worthless coins. This is when Joseph revealed his true identity to them. ]]\u00A0",
  "The man from Egypt[[\u00A0Potiphar, the Chief Minister of Egypt (Al-’Azîz). ]]\u00A0who bought him said to his wife, “Take good care of him, perhaps he may be useful to us or we may adopt him as a son.” This is how We established Joseph in the land, so that We might teach him the interpretation of dreams. Allah’s Will always prevails, but most people do not know.",
  "And when he reached maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. This is how We reward the good-doers.",
  "And the lady, in whose house he lived, tried to seduce him. She locked the doors ˹firmly˺ and said, “Come to me!” He replied, “Allah is my refuge! It is ˹not right to betray˺ my master, who has taken good care of me. Indeed, the wrongdoers never succeed.”",
  "She advanced towards him, and he would have done likewise, had he not seen a sign from his Lord.[[\u00A0Joseph (ﷺ) received warning against fornication either through divine inspiration or a vision of his father. ]]\u00A0This is how We kept evil and indecency away from him, for he was truly one of Our chosen servants.",
  "They raced for the door and she tore his shirt from the back, only to find her husband at the door. She cried, “What is the penalty for someone who tried to violate your wife, except imprisonment or a painful punishment?”",
  "Joseph responded, “It was she who tried to seduce me.” And a witness from her own family testified: “If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth and he is a liar.",
  "But if it is torn from the back, then she has lied and he is truthful.”",
  "So when her husband saw that Joseph’s shirt was torn from the back, he said ˹to her˺, “This must be ˹an example˺ of the cunning of you ˹women˺! Indeed, your cunning is so shrewd!",
  "O \u00A0Joseph! Forget about this. And you ˹O wife˺! Seek forgiveness for your sin.[[\u00A0She was urged to seek forgiveness from her husband. ]]\u00A0It certainly has been your fault.”",
  "Some women of the city gossiped, “The Chief Minister’s wife is trying to seduce her slave-boy. Love for him has plagued her heart. Indeed, we see that she is clearly mistaken.”[[\u00A0The women’s only objection was because the wife of the Chief Minister was in love with someone raised in her house like a son. ]]",
  "When she heard about their gossip,[[\u00A0lit., ‘their cunning’ because the women themselves were probably interested in Joseph. ]]\u00A0she invited them and set a banquet for them. She gave each one a knife, then said ˹to Joseph˺, “Come out before them.” When they saw him, they were so stunned ˹by his beauty˺ that they cut their hands,[[\u00A0The women were cutting fruit, and when Joseph came out they were so impressed by his beauty that they sliced through the fruit and into their hands without knowing.]]\u00A0and exclaimed, “Good God! This cannot be human; this must be a noble angel!”",
  "She said, “This is the one for whose love you criticized me! I did try to seduce him but he ˹firmly˺ refused. And if he does not do what I order him to, he will certainly be imprisoned and ˹fully˺ disgraced.”[[\u00A0The women tried to convince him to obey the Chief Minister’s wife, so Joseph prayed to Allah to keep him away from them. ]]\u00A0",
  "Joseph prayed, “My Lord! I would rather be in jail than do what they invite me to. And if You do not turn their cunning away from me, I might yield to them and fall into ignorance.”",
  "So his Lord responded to him, turning their cunning away from him. Surely He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
  "And so it occurred to those in charge, despite seeing all the proofs ˹of his innocence˺, that he should be imprisoned for a while.[[\u00A0To stop women from being charmed by Joseph’s beauty, or to put an end to the rumours, or to keep him away from the Minister’s wife. ]]\u00A0",
  "And two other servants went to jail with Joseph. One of them said, “I dreamt I was pressing wine.” The other said, “I dreamt I was carrying ˹some˺ bread on my head, from which birds were eating.” ˹Then both said,˺ “Tell us their interpretation, for we surely see you as one of the good-doers.”",
  "Joseph replied, “I can even tell you what kind of meal you will be served before you receive it. This ˹knowledge˺ is from what my Lord has taught me. I have shunned the faith of a people who disbelieve in Allah and deny the Hereafter.",
  "I follow the faith of my fathers: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is not ˹right˺ for us to associate anything with Allah ˹in worship˺. This is part of Allah’s grace upon us and humanity, but most people are not grateful.",
  "O \u00A0my fellow-prisoners! Which is far better: many different lords or Allah—the One, the Supreme?",
  "Whatever ˹idols˺ you worship instead of Him are mere names which you and your forefathers have made up[[\u00A0Meaning, “You call them gods while in fact they are not gods.” ]]—a practice Allah has never authorized. It is only Allah Who decides. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That is the upright faith, but most people do not know.",
  "“O my fellow-prisoners! ˹The first˺ one of you will serve wine to his master, and the other will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head. The matter about which you inquired has been decided.”",
  "Then he said to the one he knew would survive, “Mention me in the presence of your master.[[\u00A0The King of Egypt. ]]” But Satan made him forget to mention Joseph to his master, so he remained in prison for several years.",
  "And ˹one day˺ the King[[\u00A0In the Bible (the Book of Genesis), this ruler is referred to as a pharaoh, while in the Quran he is referred to as a king. Typically, Egypt was ruled by pharaohs, but there existed a brief period in Egyptian history in which Egypt was ruled by the Hyksos invaders (1700-1550 B.C.E.). Hyksos rulers were called kings, not pharaohs. Joseph entered Egypt during the reign of the Hyksos, who used to appoint some foreigners to prominent positions in Egypt. According to The Jewish Encyclopedia, “Those who regard the Joseph stories as historical generally hold that the Pharaoh by whom Joseph was made the practical ruler of Egypt was one of the Hyksos kings.” Joseph,\u00A0The Jewish Encyclopedia, Volume VII (London: Funk and Wagnalls Company, 1916), p. 252.]]\u00A0said, “I dreamt of seven fat cows eaten up by seven skinny ones; and seven green ears of grain and ˹seven˺ others dry. O \u00A0chiefs! Tell me the meaning of my dream if you can interpret dreams.”",
  "They replied, “These are confused visions and we do not know the interpretation of such dreams.”",
  "˹Finally,˺ the surviving ex-prisoner remembered ˹Joseph˺ after a long time and said, “I will tell you its interpretation, so send me forth ˹to Joseph˺.”",
  "˹He said,˺ “Joseph, O \u00A0man of truth! Interpret for us ˹the dream of˺ seven fat cows eaten up by seven skinny ones; and seven green ears of grain and ˹seven˺ others dry, so that I may return to the people and let them know.”",
  "Joseph replied, “You will plant ˹grain˺ for seven consecutive years, leaving in the ear whatever you will harvest, except for the little you will eat.",
  "Then after that will come seven years of great hardship which will consume whatever you have saved, except the little you will store ˹for seed˺.",
  "Then after that will come a year in which people will receive abundant rain and they will press ˹oil and wine˺.”",
  "The King ˹then˺ said, “Bring him to me.” When the messenger came to him, Joseph said, “Go back to your master and ask him about the case of the women who cut their hands. Surely my Lord has ˹full˺ knowledge of their cunning.”",
  "The King asked ˹the women˺, “What did you get when you tried to seduce Joseph?” They replied, “Allah forbid! We know nothing indecent about him.” Then the Chief Minister’s wife admitted, “Now the truth has come to light. It was I who tried to seduce him, and he is surely truthful.",
  "From this, Joseph should know that I did not speak dishonestly about him in his absence, for Allah certainly does not guide the scheming of the dishonest.",
  "And I do not seek to free myself from blame, for indeed the soul is ever inclined to evil, except those shown mercy by my Lord. Surely my Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”",
  "The King said, “Bring him to me. I will employ him exclusively in my service.” And when Joseph spoke to him, the King said, “Today you are highly esteemed and fully trusted by us.”",
  "Joseph proposed, “Put me in charge of the store-houses of the land, for I am truly reliable and adept.”",
  "This is how We established Joseph in the land to settle wherever he pleased. We shower Our mercy on whoever We will, and We never discount the reward of the good-doers.",
  "And the reward of the Hereafter is far better for those who are faithful and are mindful ˹of Allah˺.",
  "And Joseph’s brothers came and entered his presence. He recognized them but they were unaware of who he really was.",
  "When he had provided them with their supplies, he demanded, “Bring me your brother on your father’s side.[[\u00A0i.e., Benjamin. When Joseph hosted his half-brothers, they told him the number of people in their household for future supplies.]]\u00A0Do you not see that I give full measure and I am the best of hosts?",
  "But if you do not bring him to me ˹next time˺, I will have no grain for you, nor will you ever come close to me again.”",
  "They promised, “We will try to convince his father to let him come. We will certainly do ˹our best˺.”",
  "Joseph ordered his servants to put his brothers’ money back into their saddlebags so that they would find it when they returned to their family and perhaps they would come back.",
  "When Joseph’s brothers returned to their father, they pleaded, “O our father! We have been denied ˹further˺ supplies. So send our brother with us so that we may receive our measure, and we will definitely watch over him.”",
  "He responded, “Should I trust you with him as I once trusted you with his brother ˹Joseph˺? But ˹only˺ Allah is the best Protector, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.”",
  "When they opened their bags, they discovered that their money had been returned to them. They argued, “O our father! What more can we ask for? Here is our money, fully returned to us. Now we can buy more food for our family. We will watch over our brother, and obtain an extra camel-load of grain. That load can be easily secured.”",
  "Jacob insisted, “I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn oath by Allah that you will certainly bring him back to me, unless you are totally overpowered.” Then after they had given him their oaths, he concluded, “Allah is a Witness to what we have said.”",
  "He then instructed ˹them˺, “O my sons! Do not enter ˹the city˺ all through one gate, but through separate gates.[[\u00A0He told them that every three or four of them should enter through a different gate. His desire was to protect them from envy and harm.]]\u00A0I cannot help you against ˹what is destined by˺ Allah in the least. It is only Allah Who decides. In Him I put my trust. And in Him let the faithful put their trust.”",
  "Then when they entered as their father had instructed them, this did not help them against ˹the Will of˺ Allah whatsoever. It was just a desire in Jacob’s heart which he satisfied. He was truly blessed with ˹great˺ knowledge because of what We had taught him, but most people have no knowledge.",
  "When they entered Joseph’s presence, he called his brother ˹Benjamin˺ aside, and confided ˹to him˺, “I am indeed your brother ˹Joseph˺! So do not feel distressed about what they have been doing.”",
  "When Joseph had provided them with supplies, he slipped the royal cup into his brother’s bag. Then a herald cried, “O people of the caravan! You must be thieves!”",
  "They asked, turning back, “What have you lost?”",
  "The herald ˹along with the guards˺ replied, “We have lost the King’s measuring cup. And whoever brings it will be awarded a camel-load ˹of grain˺. I guarantee it.”",
  "Joseph’s brothers replied, “By Allah! You know well that we did not come to cause trouble in the land, nor are we thieves.”",
  "Joseph’s men asked, “What should be the price for theft, if you are lying?”",
  "Joseph’s brothers responded, “The price will be ˹the enslavement of˺ the one in whose bag the cup is found. That is how we punish the wrongdoers.”",
  "Joseph began searching their bags before that of his brother ˹Benjamin˺, then brought it out of Benjamin’s bag. This is how We inspired Joseph to plan. He could not have taken his brother under the King’s law, but Allah had so willed. We elevate in rank whoever We will. But above those ranking in knowledge is the One All-Knowing.",
  "˹To distance themselves,˺ Joseph’s brothers argued, “If he has stolen, so did his ˹full˺ brother before.”[[\u00A0Joseph was falsely accused of theft when he was young.]]\u00A0But Joseph suppressed his outrage—revealing nothing to them—and said ˹to himself˺, “You are in such an evil position,[[\u00A0He meant: I did not steal anything, nor did my brother ˹Benjamin˺. You are the real thieves; you stole me from my father and threw me into the well. ]]\u00A0and Allah knows best ˹the truth of˺ what you claim.”",
  "They appealed, “O Chief Minister! He has a very old father, so take one of us instead. We surely see you as one of the good-doers.”",
  "Joseph responded, “Allah forbid that we should take other than the one with whom we found our property. Otherwise, we would surely be unjust.”",
  "When they lost all hope in him, they spoke privately. The eldest of them said, “Do you not know that your father had taken a solemn oath by Allah from you, nor how you failed him regarding Joseph before? So I am not leaving this land until my father allows me to, or Allah decides for me. For He is the Best of Judges.",
  "Return to your father and say, ‘O our father! Your son committed theft. We testify only to what we know. We could not guard against the unforeseen.[[\u00A0We did not know when we gave you our solemn oath that our brother was going to steal. ]]",
  "Ask ˹the people of˺ the land where we were and the caravan we travelled with. We are certainly telling the truth.’”",
  "He cried, “No! Your souls must have tempted you to do something ˹evil˺. So ˹I am left with nothing but˺ beautiful patience![[\u00A0i.e., patience without complaining. ]]\u00A0I trust Allah will return them all to me. Surely He ˹alone˺ is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.”",
  "He turned away from them, lamenting, “Alas, poor Joseph!” And his eyes turned white out of the grief he suppressed.[[\u00A0Jacob (ﷺ) cried for so long that he became very weak-sighted. Some scholars suggest that he lost his sight completely. This does not contradict Jacob’s beautiful patience because he did not complain to anyone, but expressed his sorrow only to Allah. ]]",
  "They said, “By Allah! You will not cease to remember Joseph until you lose your health or ˹even˺ your life.”",
  "He replied, “I complain of my anguish and sorrow only to Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know.",
  "O \u00A0my sons! Go and search ˹diligently˺ for Joseph and his brother. And do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah, for no one loses hope in Allah’s mercy except those with no faith.”",
  "When they entered Joseph’s presence, they pleaded, “O Chief Minister! We and our family have been touched with hardship, and we have brought only a few worthless coins, but ˹please˺ give us our supplies in full and be charitable to us. Indeed, Allah rewards the charitable.”",
  "He asked, “Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?”",
  "They replied ˹in shock˺, “Are you really Joseph?” He said, “I am Joseph, and here is my brother ˹Benjamin˺! Allah has truly been gracious to us. Surely whoever is mindful ˹of Allah˺ and patient, then certainly Allah never discounts the reward of the good-doers.”",
  "They admitted, “By Allah! Allah has truly preferred you over us, and we have surely been sinful.”",
  "Joseph said, “There is no blame on you today. May Allah forgive you! He is the Most Merciful of the merciful!",
  "Go with this shirt of mine and cast it over my father’s face, and he will regain his sight. Then come back to me with your whole family.”",
  "When the caravan departed ˹from Egypt˺, their father said ˹to those around him˺, “You may think I am senile, but I certainly sense the smell of Joseph.”",
  "They replied, “By Allah! You are definitely still in your old delusion.”",
  "But when the bearer of the good news arrived, he cast the shirt over Jacob’s face, so he regained his sight. Jacob then said ˹to his children˺, “Did I not tell you that I truly know from Allah what you do not know?”",
  "They begged, “O our father! Pray for the forgiveness of our sins. We have certainly been sinful.”",
  "He said, “I will pray to my Lord for your forgiveness.[[\u00A0Jacob (ﷺ) delayed the prayer for his children to be forgiven until pre-dawn, which is a blessed time for supplication. ]]\u00A0He ˹alone˺ is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”",
  "When they entered Joseph’s presence, he received his parents ˹graciously˺ and said, “Enter Egypt, Allah willing, in security.”",
  "Then he raised his parents to the throne, and they all fell down in prostration to Joseph,[[\u00A0Joseph’s parents and his eleven brothers prostrated before him out of respect, not as an act of worship. This was permissible in their tradition, but in Islam, Muslims prostrate only to Allah. ]]\u00A0who then said, “O my dear father! This is the interpretation of my old dream. My Lord has made it come true. He was truly kind to me when He freed me from prison, and brought you all from the desert after Satan had ignited rivalry between me and my siblings.[[\u00A0Joseph (ﷺ) did not mention how Allah saved him from the well because he did not want to embarrass his brothers after forgiving them. ]]\u00A0Indeed my Lord is subtle in fulfilling what He wills. Surely He ˹alone˺ is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.”",
  "“My Lord! You have surely granted me authority and taught me the interpretation of dreams. ˹O˺ Originator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Guardian in this world and the Hereafter. Allow me to die as one who submits[[\u00A0lit., as a Muslim.]]\u00A0and join me with the righteous.”",
  "That is from the stories of the unseen which We reveal to you ˹O Prophet˺. You were not present when they ˹all˺[[\u00A0This includes Joseph’s brothers, the travellers who picked him up from the well and sold him into slavery, and the Chief Minister’s wife and other women in the city.]]\u00A0made up their minds, and when they plotted ˹against Joseph˺.",
  "And most people will not believe—no matter how keen you are—",
  "even though you are not asking them for a reward for this ˹Quran˺. It is only a reminder to the whole world.",
  "How many signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by with indifference!",
  "And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating others with Him ˹in worship˺.",
  "Do they feel secure that an overwhelming torment from Allah will not overtake them, or that the Hour will not take them by surprise when they least expect ˹it˺?",
  "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “This is my way. I invite to Allah with insight—I and those who follow me. Glory be to Allah, and I am not one of the polytheists.”",
  "We only sent before you ˹O Prophet˺ men inspired by Us from among the people of each society. Have the deniers not travelled through the land to see what was the end of those ˹destroyed˺ before them? And surely the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?",
  "And when the messengers despaired and their people thought the messengers had been denied help, Our help came to them ˹at last˺. We then saved whoever We willed, and Our punishment is never averted from the wicked people.",
  "In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of reason. This message cannot be a fabrication, rather ˹it is˺ a confirmation of previous revelation, a detailed explanation of all things, a guide, and a mercy for people of faith.",
  "Alif-Lãm-Mĩm-Ra. These are the verses of the Book. What has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ from your Lord is the truth, but most people do not believe.",
  "It is Allah Who has raised the heavens without pillars—as you can see—then established Himself on the Throne. He has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. He conducts the whole affair. He makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.",
  "And He is the One Who spread out the earth and placed firm mountains and rivers upon it, and created fruits of every kind in pairs.[[\u00A0Males and females, sweet and bitter, etc. ]]\u00A0He covers the day with night. Surely in this are signs for those who reflect.",
  "And on the earth there are ˹different˺ neighbouring tracts, gardens of grapevines, ˹various˺ crops, palm trees—some stemming from the same root, others standing alone. They are all irrigated with the same water, yet We make some taste better than others. Surely in this are signs for those who understand.",
  "˹Now,˺ if anything should amaze you ˹O Prophet˺, then it is their question: “When we are reduced to dust, will we really be raised as a new creation?” It is they who have disbelieved in their Lord. It is they who will have shackles around their necks. And it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.",
  "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ to hasten the torment rather than grace, though there have ˹already˺ been ˹many˺ torments before them. Surely your Lord is full of forgiveness for people, despite their wrongdoing, and your Lord is truly severe in punishment.",
  "The disbelievers say, “If only a sign could be sent down to him from his Lord.” You ˹O Prophet˺ are only a warner. And every people had a guide.",
  "Allah knows what every female bears and what increases and decreases in the wombs.[[\u00A0He knows whether the egg will be fertilized or not, whether the baby will be born before or after nine months, whether the pregnancy will end with delivery or miscarriage, and whether there will be one baby or more. ]]\u00A0And with Him everything is determined with precision.",
  "˹He is the˺ Knower of the seen and the unseen—the All-Great, Most Exalted.",
  "It is the same ˹to Him˺ whether any of you speaks secretly or openly, whether one hides in the darkness of night or goes about in broad daylight.",
  "For each one there are successive angels before and behind, protecting them by Allah’s command. Indeed, Allah would never change a people’s state ˹of favour˺ until they change their own state ˹of faith˺. And if it is Allah’s Will to torment a people, it can never be averted, nor can they find a protector other than Him.",
  "He is the One Who shows you lightning, inspiring ˹you with˺ hope and fear,[[\u00A0Hope of rain and fear of torment. ]]\u00A0and produces heavy clouds.",
  "The thunder glorifies His praises, as do the angels in awe of Him. He sends thunderbolts, striking with them whoever He wills. Yet they dispute about Allah. And He is tremendous in might.",
  "Calling upon Him ˹alone˺ is the truth. But those ˹idols˺ the pagans invoke besides Him ˹can˺ never respond to them in any way. ˹It is˺ just like someone who stretches out their hands to water, ˹asking it˺ to reach their mouths, but it can never do so. The calls of the disbelievers are only in vain.",
  "To Allah ˹alone˺ bow down ˹in submission˺[[\u00A0lit., prostrate. Meaning, all beings submit to His Will.]]\u00A0all those in the heavens and the earth—willingly or unwillingly—as do their shadows, morning and evening.",
  "Ask ˹them, O \u00A0Prophet˺, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?” Say, “Allah!” Ask ˹them˺, “Why ˹then˺ have you taken besides Him lords who cannot even benefit or protect themselves?” Say, “Can the blind and the sighted be equal? Or can darkness and light be equal?”[[\u00A0Blindness and darkness are commonly used as an analogy for disbelief, whereas the ability to see and light refer to true faith in Allah.]]\u00A0Or have they associated with Allah partners who ˹supposedly˺ produced a creation like His, leaving them confused between the two creations? Say, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Supreme.”",
  "He sends down rain from the sky, causing the valleys to flow, each according to its capacity. The currents then carry along rising foam, similar to the slag produced from metal that people melt in the fire for ornaments or tools. This is how Allah compares truth to falsehood. The ˹worthless˺ residue is then cast away, but what benefits people remains on the earth. This is how Allah sets forth parables.",
  "Those who respond to ˹the call of˺ their Lord will have the finest reward. As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to ransom themselves. They will face strict judgment, and Hell will be their home. What an evil place to rest!",
  "Can the one who knows that your Lord’s revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ is the truth be like the one who is blind? None will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason.",
  "˹They are˺ those who honour Allah’s covenant, never breaking the pledge;",
  "and those who maintain whatever ˹ties˺ Allah has ordered to be maintained, stand in awe of their Lord, and fear strict judgment.",
  "And ˹they are˺ those who endure patiently, seeking their Lord’s pleasure,[[\u00A0lit., seeking their Lord’s Face.]]\u00A0establish prayer, donate from what We have provided for them—secretly and openly—and respond to evil with good. It is they who will have the ultimate abode:",
  "the Gardens of Eternity, which they will enter along with the righteous among their parents, spouses, and descendants. And the angels will enter upon them from every gate, ˹saying,˺",
  "“Peace be upon you for your perseverance. How excellent is the ultimate abode!”",
  "And those who violate Allah’s covenant after it has been affirmed, break whatever ˹ties˺ Allah has ordered to be maintained, and spread corruption in the land—it is they who will be condemned and will have the worst abode.[[\u00A0i.e., the Hellfire. ]]\u00A0",
  "Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. And the disbelievers become prideful of ˹the pleasures of˺ this worldly life. But the life of this world, compared to the Hereafter, is nothing but a fleeting enjoyment.",
  "The disbelievers say, “If only a sign could be sent down to him from his Lord.”[[\u00A0The disbelievers demanded a tangible miracle such as the staff of Moses.]]\u00A0Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Indeed, Allah leaves to stray whoever He wills, and guides to Himself whoever turns to Him—",
  "those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Surely in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find comfort.",
  "Those who believe and do good, for them will be bliss and an honourable destination.”",
  "And so We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ to a community, like ˹We did with˺ earlier communities, so that you may recite to them what We have revealed to you. Yet they deny the Most Compassionate.[[\u00A0See\u00A0{17:110} and {25:60}.]]\u00A0Say, “He is my Lord! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. In Him I put my trust, and to Him I turn ˹in repentance˺.”",
  "If there were a recitation that could cause mountains to move, or the earth to split, or the dead to speak, ˹it would have been this Quran˺. But all matters are by Allah’s Will.

And disasters will continue to afflict the disbelievers or strike close to their homes for their misdeeds, until Allah’s promise comes to pass. Surely Allah never fails in His promise.",
  "Other messengers had already been ridiculed before you, but I delayed the disbelievers ˹for a while˺ then seized them. And how ˹horrible˺ was My punishment!",
  "Is ˹there any equal to˺ the Vigilant One Who knows what every soul commits? Yet the pagans have associated others with Allah ˹in worship˺. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Name them! Or do you ˹mean to˺ inform Him of something He does not know on the earth? Or are these ˹gods˺ just empty words?” In fact, the disbelievers’ falsehood has been made so appealing to them that they have been turned away from the Path. And whoever Allah leaves to stray will be left with no guide.",
  "For them is punishment in this worldly life, but the punishment of the Hereafter is truly far worse. And none can shield them from Allah.",
  "The description of the Paradise promised to the righteous is that under it rivers flow; eternal is its fruit as well as its shade. That is the ˹ultimate˺ outcome for the righteous. But the outcome for the disbelievers is the Fire!",
  "˹The believers among˺ those who were given the Scripture rejoice at what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺, while some ˹disbelieving˺ factions deny a portion of it. Say, “I have only been commanded to worship Allah, associating none with Him ˹in worship˺. To Him I invite ˹all˺, and to Him is my return.”",
  "And so We have revealed it as an authority in Arabic. And if you were to follow their desires after ˹all˺ the knowledge that has come to you, there would be none to protect or shield you from Allah.",
  "We have certainly sent messengers before you ˹O Prophet˺ and blessed them with wives and offspring. It was not for any messenger to bring a sign without Allah’s permission. Every destined matter has a ˹set˺ time.",

  "Do they not see that We gradually reduce their land from its borders? Allah decides—none can reverse His decision. And He is swift in reckoning.",
  "Those ˹disbelievers˺ before them ˹secretly˺ planned, but Allah has the ultimate plan. He knows what every soul commits. And the disbelievers will soon know who will have the ultimate outcome.",
  "The disbelievers say, “You ˹Muḥammad˺ are no messenger.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah is sufficient as a Witness between me and you, as is whoever has knowledge of the Scripture.”",
  "Alif-Lãm-Ra. ˹This is˺ a Book which We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ so that you may lead people out of darkness and into light, by the Will of their Lord, to the Path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy—",

  "We have not sent a messenger except in the language of his people to clarify ˹the message˺ for them. Then Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise.",
  "Indeed, We sent Moses with Our signs, ˹ordering him,˺ “Lead your people out of darkness and into light, and remind them of Allah’s days ˹of favour˺.” Surely in this are signs for whoever is steadfast, grateful.",
  "˹Consider˺ when Moses said to his people, “Remember Allah’s favour upon you when He rescued you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment—slaughtering your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord.",

  "Moses added, “If you along with everyone on earth were to be ungrateful, then ˹know that˺ Allah is indeed Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.”",
  "Have you not ˹already˺ received the stories of those who were before you: the people of Noah, ’Âd, Thamûd, and those after them? Only Allah knows how many they were. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they put their hands over their mouths[[\u00A0This can mean that the disbelievers bit their own hands in rage, or they covered their own mouths mockingly, or that they put their hands over their messengers’ mouths to silence them.]]\u00A0and said, “We totally reject what you have been sent with, and we are certainly in alarming doubt about what you are inviting us to.”",
  "Their messengers asked ˹them˺, “Is there any doubt about Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? He is inviting you in order to forgive your sins, and delay your end until your appointed term.”[[\u00A0It is out of Allah’s mercy that He does not hasten your punishment but delays your death until your destined time.]]\u00A0They argued, “You are no more than humans like us! You ˹only˺ wish to turn us away from what our forefathers worshipped. So bring us some compelling proof.”",
  "Their messengers said to them, “We are ˹indeed˺ only humans like you, but Allah favours whoever He chooses of His servants. It is not for us to bring you any proof without Allah’s permission. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.",

  "The disbelievers then threatened their messengers, “We will certainly expel you from our land, unless you return to our faith.” So their Lord revealed to them, “We will surely destroy the wrongdoers,",

  "And both sides called for judgment, so every stubborn tyrant was doomed.",
  "Awaiting them is Hell, and they will be left to drink oozing pus,",

  "The parable of the deeds of those who disbelieve in their Lord is that of ashes fiercely blown away by wind on a stormy day. They will gain nothing from what they have earned. That is ˹truly˺ the farthest one can stray.",
  "Have you not seen that Allah created the heavens and the earth for a reason? If He wills, He can eliminate you and produce a new creation.",
  "And that is not difficult for Allah ˹at all˺.",
  "They will all appear before Allah, and the lowly ˹followers˺ will appeal to the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “We were your ˹dedicated˺ followers, so will you ˹then˺ protect us from Allah’s torment in any way?” They will reply, “Had Allah guided us, we would have guided you. ˹Now˺ it is all the same for us whether we suffer patiently or impatiently, there is no escape for us.”",
  "And Satan will say ˹to his followers˺ after the judgment has been passed, “Indeed, Allah has made you a true promise.\u00A0I too made you a promise, but I failed you. I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves. I cannot save you, nor can you save me. Indeed, I denounce your previous association of me with Allah ˹in loyalty˺. Surely the wrongdoers will suffer a painful punishment.”",
  "Those who believe and do good will be admitted into Gardens, under which rivers flow—to stay there forever by the Will of their Lord—where they will be greeted with “Peace!”",
  "Do you not see how Allah compares a good word to a good tree? Its root is firm and its branches reach the sky,",
  "˹always˺ yielding its fruit in every season by the Will of its Lord. This is how Allah sets forth parables for the people, so perhaps they will be mindful.",
  "And the parable of an evil word is that of an evil tree, uprooted from the earth, having no stability.",
  "Allah makes the believers steadfast with the firm Word ˹of faith˺[[\u00A0That there is only one God worthy of worship. ]]\u00A0in this worldly life and the Hereafter. And Allah leaves the wrongdoers to stray. For Allah does what He wills.",

  "And Allah sets forth a parable of two men: one of them is dumb, incapable of anything. He is a burden on his master. Wherever he is sent, he brings no good. Can such a person be equal to the one who commands justice and is on the Straight Path?[[\u00A0The two parables emphasize that Almighty Allah masterfully conducts the affairs of the heavens and the earth, whereas false gods are incapable of anything.

  "Do not be like the woman who ˹foolishly˺ unravels her yarn after it is firmly spun, by taking your oaths as a means of deceiving one another in favour of a stronger group. Surely Allah tests you through this. And on the Day of Judgment He will certainly make your differences clear to you.",
  "Had Allah willed, He could have easily made you one community ˹of believers˺, but He leaves to stray whoever He wills and guides whoever He wills.[[\u00A0He guides those who are sincere in their quest for guidance.]]\u00A0And you will certainly be questioned about what you used to do.",

This journey came as a comfort for the Prophet after several years of hardship and persecution, which included a 3-year siege by Meccan pagans, who drove the Muslims out of the city and forbade anyone from trading, marrying, or feeding them. This was followed by the “Year of Sadness,” which included the death of the Prophet’s uncle Abu Ṭâlib, the major defender of Muḥammad (ﷺ) despite his disbelief in his message, as well as the death of the Prophet’s beloved wife Khadîjah. The Prophet was carried overnight by a noble steed (called Burâq) from Mecca to Jerusalem where he met some earlier prophets and led them in prayer. He was later carried to the heavens (this journey is called Al-Mi’râj, or the Ascension) where he received direct orders from Allah to observe five daily prayers. The Ascension is referred to in {53:13}–18.]]\u00A0Indeed, He[[\u00A0i.e., Allah.]]\u00A0alone is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.",

The youths slept for 300 years, plus nine (300 solar years equal 309 lunar years). ]]\u00A0were ˹the only˺ wonders of Our signs?",
  "˹Remember˺ when those youths took refuge in the cave, and said, “Our Lord! Grant us mercy from Yourself and guide us rightly through our ordeal.”",
  "So We caused them to fall into a dead sleep[[\u00A0lit., We cast a cover of ˹deep˺ sleep over their ears.]]\u00A0in the cave for many years,",
  "then We raised them so We may show which of the two groups would make a better estimation of the length of their stay.[[\u00A0The People of the Cave themselves disagreed on how long they had slept in the cave. See\u00A0{18:19}.]]\u00A0",
  "We relate to you ˹O Prophet˺ their story in truth. They were youths who truly believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.",
  "And We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and declared, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never call upon any god besides Him, or we would truly be uttering an outrageous lie.”",
  "˹Then they said to one another,˺ “These people of ours have taken gods besides Him. Why do they not produce a clear proof of them? Who then does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah?",
  "Since you have distanced yourselves from them and what they worship besides Allah, take refuge in the cave. Your Lord will extend His mercy to you and accommodate you in your ordeal.”",
  "And you would have seen the sun, as it rose, inclining away from their cave to the right, and as it set, declining away from them to the left, while they lay in its open space.[[\u00A0While they slept in the open space of the cave, fresh air blew through the cave, but they were protected from the heat of the sun.]]\u00A0That is one of the signs of Allah. Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. But whoever He leaves to stray, you will never find for them a guiding mentor.",
  "And you would have thought they were awake,[[\u00A0This is because, during their long sleep, their eyes were open, their hair grew long, and their bodies rolled over to the right and left to prevent bedsores.]]\u00A0though they were asleep. We turned them over, to the right and left, while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance. Had you looked at them, you would have certainly fled away from them, filled with horror.",
  "And so We awakened them so that they might question one another. One of them exclaimed, “How long have you remained ˹asleep˺?” Some replied, “Perhaps a day, or part of a day.” They said ˹to one another˺, “Your Lord knows best how long you have remained. So send one of you with these silver coins of yours to the city, and let him find which food is the purest, and then bring you provisions from it. Let him be ˹exceptionally˺ cautious, and do not let him give you away.",
  "For, indeed, if they find out about you, they will stone you ˹to death˺, or force you back into their faith, and then you will never succeed.”",
  "That is how We caused them to be discovered so that their people might know that Allah’s promise ˹of resurrection˺ is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour.[[\u00A0Their antique silver coins gave them away.

  "Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others will say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” ˹only˺ guessing blindly.

  "And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his young assistant, “I will never give up until I reach the junction of the two seas, even if I travel for ages.”[[\u00A0It is reported in an authentic narration collected by Bukhâri that a man approached Moses after he gave a talk and asked him, “Who is the most knowledgeable person on earth?” Moses responded, “That would be me!” So Allah revealed to Moses that he should not have said this and there was in fact someone who was more knowledgeable than him. Moses was commanded to travel to meet this man, named Al-Khaḍir, at the junction of the two seas (which could be the northern part of Sinai between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, or the Southern part of Sinai where the Rea Sea splits into the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba). ]]",
  "But when they ˹finally˺ reached the point where the seas met, they forgot their ˹salted˺ fish, and it made its way into the sea, slipping away ˹wondrously˺.",
  "When they had passed further, he said to his assistant, “Bring us our meal! We have certainly been exhausted by today’s journey.”",
  "He replied, “Do you remember when we rested by the rock? ˹That is when˺ I forgot the fish. None made me forget to mention this except Satan. And the fish made its way into the sea miraculously.”[[\u00A0Another possible translation: “The ˹salted˺ fish must have made its way into the sea. How strange!”]]",
  "Moses responded, “That is ˹exactly˺ what we were looking for.”[[\u00A0Moses was given a sign: when he and his assistant Joshua (or Yûsha’ ibn Nûn) lost their food (a salted fish), this would be the place where they would find the man of knowledge.]]\u00A0So they returned, retracing their footsteps.",
  "There they found a servant of Ours, to whom We had granted mercy from Us and enlightened with knowledge of Our Own.",
  "Moses said to him, “May I follow you, provided that you teach me some of the right guidance you have been taught?”",
  "He said, “You certainly cannot be patient ˹enough˺ with me.",
  "And how can you be patient with what is beyond your ˹realm of˺ knowledge?”",
  "Moses assured ˹him˺, “You will find me patient, Allah willing, and I will not disobey any of your orders.”",
  "He responded, “Then if you follow me, do not question me about anything until I ˹myself˺ clarify it for you.”",
  "So they set out, but after they had boarded a ship, the man made a hole in it. Moses protested, “Have you done this to drown its people? You have certainly done a terrible thing!”",
  "He replied, “Did I not say that you cannot have patience with me?”",
  "Moses pleaded, “Excuse me for forgetting, and do not be hard on me.”",
  "So they proceeded until they came across a boy, and the man killed him. Moses protested, “Have you killed an innocent soul, who killed no one? You have certainly done a horrible thing.”",
  "He answered, “Did I not tell you that you cannot have patience with me?”",
  "Moses replied, “If I ever question you about anything after this, then do not keep me in your company, for by then I would have given you enough of an excuse.”",
  "So they moved on until they came to the people of a town. They asked them for food, but the people refused to give them hospitality. There they found a wall ready to collapse, so the man set it right. Moses protested, “If you wanted, you could have demanded a fee for this.”",
  "He replied, “This is the parting of our ways. I will explain to you what you could not bear patiently.",
  "“As for the ship, it belonged to some poor people, working at sea. So I intended to damage it, for there was a ˹tyrant˺ king ahead of them who seizes every ˹good˺ ship by force.",
  "“And as for the boy, his parents were ˹true˺ believers, and we[[\u00A0This is the royal ‘we’.]]\u00A0feared that he would pressure them into defiance and disbelief.",
  "So we hoped that their Lord would give them another, more virtuous and caring in his place.",
  "“And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and under the wall was a treasure that belonged to them, and their father had been a righteous man. So your Lord willed that these children should come of age and retrieve their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. I did not do it ˹all˺ on my own. This is the explanation of what you could not bear patiently.”[[\u00A0The Prophet (ﷺ) commented on the story, “I wish Moses had been more patient so we can learn more from that wise man.”]]\u00A0",
  "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about Ⱬul-Qarnain. Say, “I will relate to you something of his narrative.”[[\u00A0This is the story of a righteous king who travelled far and wide. He is titled Ⱬul-Qarnain (lit., the man of the two horns) because of his journeys to the far east and far west (or the two horns/points of sunrise and sunset). Some believe Ⱬul-Qarnain was Alexander the Great, but this is not sound since Alexander the Great was a polytheist. Many scholars believe it was Abu Kuraib Al-Ḥamiri, a righteous king from Yemen.]]",
  "Surely We established him in the land, and gave him the means to all things.",
  "So he travelled a course,",
  "until he reached the setting ˹point˺ of the sun, which appeared to him to be setting in a spring of murky water, where he found some people. We said, “O Ⱬul-Qarnain! Either punish them or treat them kindly.”",
  "He responded, “Whoever does wrong will be punished by us, then will be returned to their Lord, Who will punish them with a horrible torment.",
  "As for those who believe and do good, they will have the finest reward, and we will assign them easy commands.”",
  "Then he travelled a ˹different˺ course",
  "until he reached the rising ˹point˺ of the sun. He found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter from it.[[\u00A0They either had no clothes or homes to protect them from the sun. ]]",
  "So it was. And We truly had full knowledge of him.",
  "Then he travelled a ˹third˺ course",
  "until he reached ˹a pass˺ between two mountains. He found in front of them a people who could hardly understand ˹his˺ language.",
  "They pleaded, “O Ⱬul-Qarnain! Surely Gog and Magog[[\u00A0Gog and Magog are two wild peoples who were sealed off by a barrier built by Ⱬul-Qarnain to stop them from raiding their peaceful neighbours. There are many speculations as to their location, but none is supported by reliable sources. Their coming out is mentioned in {21:96}-97 as one of the major signs of the final Hour. ]]\u00A0are spreading corruption throughout the land. Should we pay you tribute, provided that you build a wall between us and them?”",
  "He responded, “What my Lord has provided for me is far better. But assist me with resources, and I will build a barrier between you and them.",
  "Bring me blocks of iron!” Then, when he had filled up ˹the gap˺ between the two mountains, he ordered, “Blow!” When the iron became red hot, he said, “Bring me molten copper to pour over it.”",
  "And so the enemies could neither scale nor tunnel through it.",
  "He declared, “This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will level it to the ground. And my Lord’s promise is ever true.”",
  "On that Day, We will let them[[\u00A0Gog and Magog. ]]\u00A0surge ˹like waves˺ over one another. Later, the Trumpet will be blown,[[\u00A0On the Day of Judgment, the Trumpet will be blown by an angel—causing all to die. When it is blown a second time, everyone will be raised from the dead to be assembled for the Judgment (see\u00A0{39:68}). ]]\u00A0and We will gather all ˹people˺ together.",
  "On that Day We will display Hell clearly for the disbelievers,",

  "Do the disbelievers think they can ˹simply˺ take My servants[[\u00A0i.e., Jesus, Ezra, and the angels. ]]\u00A0as lords instead of Me? We have surely prepared Hell as an accommodation for the disbelievers.",
  "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Shall we inform you of who will lose the most deeds?",
  "˹They are˺ those whose efforts are in vain in this worldly life, while they think they are doing good!”",
  "It is they who reject the signs of their Lord and their meeting with Him, rendering their deeds void, so We will not give their deeds any weight on Judgment Day.",
  "That is their reward: Hell, for their disbelief and mockery of My signs and messengers.",
  "Indeed, those who believe and do good will have the Gardens of Paradise[[\u00A0Al-Firdaws, the highest place in Paradise. ]]\u00A0as an accommodation,",
  "where they will be forever, never desiring anywhere else.",

  "˹This is˺ a reminder of your Lord’s mercy to His servant Zachariah,",

  "And I am concerned about ˹the faith of˺ my relatives after me, since my wife is barren. So grant me, by Your grace, an heir,",

  "˹The angels announced,˺ “O Zachariah! Indeed, We give you the good news of ˹the birth of˺ a son, whose name will be John—a name We have not given to anyone before.”",
  "He wondered, “My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren, and I have become extremely old?”",
  "An angel replied, “So will it be! Your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me, just as I created you before, when you were nothing!’”",
  "Zachariah said, “My Lord! Grant me a sign.” He responded, “Your sign is that you will not ˹be able to˺ speak to people for three nights, despite being healthy.”",
  "So he came out to his people from the sanctuary, signalling to them to glorify ˹Allah˺ morning and evening.",
  "˹It was later said,˺ “O John! Hold firmly to the Scriptures.” And We granted him wisdom while ˹he was still˺ a child,",
  "as well as purity and compassion from Us. And he was God-fearing,",
  "and kind to his parents. He was neither arrogant nor disobedient.",
  "Peace be upon him the day he was born, and the day of his death, and the day he will be raised back to life!",
  "And mention in the Book ˹O Prophet, the story of˺ Mary when she withdrew from her family to a place in the east,",

  "She appealed, “I truly seek refuge in the Most Compassionate from you! ˹So leave me alone˺ if you are God-fearing.”",
  "He responded, “I am only a messenger from your Lord, ˹sent˺ to bless you with a pure son.”",
  "She wondered, “How can I have a son when no man has ever touched me, nor am I unchaste?”",
  "He replied, “So will it be! Your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me. And so will We make him a sign for humanity and a mercy from Us.’ It is a matter ˹already˺ decreed.”",
  "So she conceived him and withdrew with him to a remote place.",
  "Then the pains of labour drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She cried, “Alas! I wish I had died before this, and was a thing long forgotten!”",
  "So a voice[[\u00A0This was the voice of baby Jesus. Some say it was Gabriel. ]]\u00A0reassured her from below her, “Do not grieve! Your Lord has provided a stream at your feet.",
  "And shake the trunk of this palm tree towards you, it will drop fresh, ripe dates upon you.",
  "So eat and drink, and put your heart at ease. But if you see any of the people, say, ‘I have vowed silence[[\u00A0lit., fast ˹from speech˺. Linguistically, ṣawm\u00A0means to abstain from something, such as food, speaking, and playing.]]\u00A0to the Most Compassionate, so I am not talking to anyone today.’”",
  "Then she returned to her people, carrying him. They said ˹in shock˺, “O Mary! You have certainly done a horrible thing!",

  "So she pointed to the baby. They exclaimed, “How can we talk to someone who is an infant in the cradle?”",
  "Jesus declared, “I am truly a servant of Allah. He has destined me to be given the Scripture and to be a prophet.",
  "He has made me a blessing wherever I go, and bid me to establish prayer and give alms-tax as long as I live,",

  "Peace be upon me the day I was born, the day I die, and the day I will be raised back to life!”",
  "That is Jesus, son of Mary. ˹And this is˺ a word of truth, about which they dispute.",
  "It is not for Allah to take a son! Glory be to Him. When He decrees a matter, He simply tells it, “Be!” And it is!",

  "Indeed, it is We Who will succeed the earth and whoever is on it. And to Us they will ˹all˺ be returned.",
  "And mention in the Book ˹O Prophet, the story of˺ Abraham. He was surely a man of truth and a prophet.",

  "O \u00A0dear father! I have certainly received some knowledge which you have not received, so follow me and I will guide you to the Straight Path.",
  "O \u00A0dear father! Do not worship Satan. Surely Satan is ever rebellious against the Most Compassionate.",
  "O \u00A0dear father! I truly fear that you will be touched by a torment from the Most Compassionate, and become Satan’s companion ˹in Hell˺.”",
  "He threatened, “How dare you reject my idols, O \u00A0Abraham! If you do not desist, I will certainly stone you ˹to death˺. So be gone from me for a long time!”",
  "Abraham responded, “Peace be upon you! I will pray to my Lord for your forgiveness. He has truly been Most Gracious to me.",
  "As I distance myself from ˹all of˺ you and from whatever you invoke besides Allah, I will ˹continue to˺ call upon my Lord ˹alone˺, trusting that I will never be disappointed in invoking my Lord.”",
  "So after he had left them and what they worshipped besides Allah, We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and made each of them a prophet.",

This is what my lower-self tempted me to do.” According to many Quran commentators, while Moses and the Children of Israel were crossing the sea to escape abuse by Pharaoh and his people, the Sâmiri saw Gabriel on a horse leading the way, and every time the horse touched the ground, it turned green. So the Sâmiri took a handful of dust from the hoof-prints of the horse, and later tossed it at the calf so it started to make a lowing sound. ]]",

  "And ˹remember˺ when David and Solomon passed judgment regarding the crops ruined ˹at night˺ by someone’s sheep, and We were witness to their judgments.",
  "We guided ˹young˺ Solomon to a fairer settlement,[[\u00A0A man’s flock of sheep strayed into another man’s vineyard, eating and destroying all his produce. When the two men came to David for judgment, he ruled that the shepherd must give his animals to the vineyard owner in compensation for the damage. On their way out, the two men met young Solomon and the shepherd complained to him. Solomon discussed the case with his father, and suggested that the sheep should be kept with the man who lost his produce so he may benefit from their milk and wool, while the shepherd worked on the farm to restore it to its original state. Eventually the famer would take back his farm in perfect condition, and the sheep would be returned to the shepherd. David was impressed by his son’s insight and approved his fair judgment immediately. ]]\u00A0and granted each of them wisdom and knowledge. We subjected the mountains as well as the birds to hymn ˹Our praises˺ along with David. It is We Who did ˹it all˺.",
  "We taught him the art of making body armour to protect you in battle. Will you then be grateful?",
  "And to Solomon We subjected the raging winds, blowing by his command to the land We had showered with blessings. It is We Who know everything.",
  "And ˹We subjected˺ some jinn[[\u00A0lit., devils. ]]\u00A0that dived for him,[[\u00A0The jinn dived to bring him pearls. ]]\u00A0and performed other duties. It is We Who kept them in check.",
  "And ˹remember˺ when Job cried out to his Lord, “I have been touched with adversity,[[\u00A0This refers to his loss of health, wealth, and children. ]]\u00A0and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”",
  "So We answered his prayer and removed his adversity, and gave him back his family, twice as many, as a mercy from Us and a lesson for the ˹devoted˺ worshippers.",
  "And ˹remember˺ Ishmael, Enoch, and Ⱬul-Kifl.[[\u00A0Scholars are in disagreement as to whether Ⱬul-Kifl was a prophet or just a righteous man. Those who maintain that he was a prophet identify him with various Biblical prophets such as Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Obadiah.]]\u00A0They were all steadfast.",
  "We admitted them into Our mercy, for they were truly of the righteous.",
  "And ˹remember˺ when the Man of the Whale stormed off ˹from his city˺ in a rage, thinking We would not restrain him.[[\u00A0Or “thinking We will let him get away with it.” Jonah (ﷺ) had been met with denial for many years. When he sensed the coming of Allah’s torment, he abandoned his city without Allah’s permission. Eventually, his people repented before the coming of the torment, and Allah accepted their repentance (see\u00A0{10:98}), whereas Jonah ended up in the belly of the whale (see\u00A0{37:140}-148).]]\u00A0Then in the ˹veils of˺ darkness[[\u00A0The darkness of the night, the sea, and the belly of the whale. ]]\u00A0he cried out, “There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except You. Glory be to You! I have certainly done wrong.”",
  "So We answered his prayer and rescued him from anguish. And so do We save the ˹true˺ believers.",
  "And ˹remember˺ when Zachariah cried out to his Lord, “My Lord! Do not leave me childless, though You are the Best of Successors.”[[\u00A0Meaning, “You will be there for eternity after all pass away.” ]]",
  "So We answered his prayer, granted him John, and made his wife fertile. Indeed, they used to race in doing good, and call upon Us with hope and fear, totally humbling themselves before Us.",
  "And ˹remember˺ the one who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her through Our angel, ˹Gabriel,˺[[\u00A0Gabriel breathed into the sleeves of Mary’s garment so she conceived Jesus. ]]\u00A0making her and her son a sign for all peoples.",
  "˹O prophets!˺ Indeed, this religion of yours is ˹only˺ one, and I am your Lord, so worship Me ˹alone˺.",
  "Yet the people have divided it into sects. But to Us they will all return.",
  "So whoever does good and is a believer will never be denied ˹the reward for˺ their striving, for We are recording it all.",
  "It is impossible for a society which We have destroyed to ever rise again,",
  "until ˹after˺ Gog and Magog have broken loose ˹from the barrier˺,[[\u00A0See\u00A0{18:93}-99.]]\u00A0swarming down from every hill,",
  "ushering in the True Promise.[[\u00A0i.e., the Final Hour. ]]\u00A0Then—behold!—the disbelievers will stare ˹in horror, crying,˺ “Oh, woe to us! We have truly been heedless of this. In fact, we have been wrongdoers.”",
  "Certainly you ˹disbelievers˺ and whatever you worship instead of Allah will be the fuel of Hell.[[\u00A0See\u00A0footnote for {43:57}-58.]]\u00A0You are ˹all˺ bound to enter it.",
  "Had those idols been ˹true˺ gods, they would not have entered it. And they will be there forever.",
  "In it they will groan, and will not be able to hear.",
  "Surely those for whom We have destined the finest reward will be kept far away from Hell,",
  "not even hearing the slightest hissing from it. And they will delight forever in what their souls desire.",
  "The Supreme Horror ˹of that Day˺ will not disturb them, and the angels will greet them, ˹saying,˺ “This is your Day, which you have been promised.”",
  "On that Day We will roll up the heavens like a scroll of writings. Just as We produced the first creation, ˹so˺ shall We reproduce it. That is a promise binding on Us. We truly uphold ˹Our promises˺!",
  "Surely, following the ˹heavenly˺ Record, We decreed in the Scriptures: “My righteous servants shall inherit the land.”[[\u00A0This refers to Psalm {37:29}: “The righteous shall inherit the land.” See\u00A0footnote for {39:47}.]]",
  "Surely this ˹Quran˺ is sufficient ˹as a reminder˺ for those devoted to worship.",
  "We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ only as a mercy for the whole world.",
  "Say, “What has been revealed to me is this: ‘Your God is only One God.’ Will you then submit?”",
  "If they turn away, then say, “I have warned you all equally. I do not know if what you are threatened with is near or far.",
  "Allah surely knows what you say openly and whatever you hide.",
  "I do not know if this ˹delay˺ is possibly a test for you and an enjoyment for a while.”",
  "˹In the end,˺ the Prophet said, “My Lord! Judge ˹between us˺ in truth. And our Lord is the Most Compassionate, Whose help is sought against what you claim.”[[\u00A0Meaning, “We seek Allah’s help against your claims that He has partners ˹in worship˺.”]]\u00A0",
  "O humanity! Fear your Lord, for the ˹violent˺ quaking at the Hour is surely a dreadful thing.",
  "The Day you see it, every nursing mother will abandon what she is nursing, and every pregnant woman will deliver her burden ˹prematurely˺. And you will see people ˹as if they were˺ drunk, though they will not be drunk; but the torment of Allah is ˹terribly˺ severe.",
  "˹Still˺ there are some who dispute about Allah without knowledge, and follow every rebellious devil.",
  "It has been decreed for such devils that whoever takes them as a guide will be misguided and led by them into the torment of the Blaze.",
  "O humanity! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then ˹know that˺ We did create you[[\u00A0Your father, Adam.]]\u00A0from dust, then from a sperm-drop,[[\u00A0Nuṭfah\u00A0refers to the union of male and female gametes (sperm and egg) which results in the zygote after fertilization. ]]\u00A0then ˹developed you into˺ a clinging clot ˹of blood˺,[[\u00A0’Alaqah, meaning the embryo resembles a leech. ]]\u00A0then a lump of flesh[[\u00A0Muḍghah, meaning it resembles a chewed morsel. ]]—fully formed or unformed[[\u00A0Fully formed or defected, evolving into a healthy embryo or ending in miscarriage. ]]—in order to demonstrate ˹Our power˺ to you. ˹Then˺ We settle whatever ˹embryo˺ We will in the womb for an appointed term, then bring you forth as infants, so that you may reach your prime. Some of you ˹may˺ die ˹young˺, while others are left to reach the most feeble stage of life so that they may know nothing after having known much. And you see the earth lifeless, but as soon as We send down rain upon it, it begins to stir ˹to life˺ and swell, producing every type of pleasant plant.",
  "That is because Allah ˹alone˺ is the Truth, He ˹alone˺ gives life to the dead, and He ˹alone˺ is Most Capable of everything.",
  "And certainly the Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it. And Allah will surely resurrect those in the graves.",
  "˹Still˺ there are some who dispute about Allah without knowledge, guidance, or an enlightening scripture,",

That is ˹truly˺ the clearest loss.",
  "They call besides Allah what can neither harm nor benefit them. That is ˹truly˺ the farthest one can stray.",
  "They invoke those whose worship leads to harm, not benefit. What an evil patron and what an evil associate!",
  "Indeed, Allah will admit those who believe and do good into Gardens, under which rivers flow. Surely Allah does what He wills.",
  "Whoever thinks that Allah will not help His Prophet in this world and the Hereafter, let them stretch out a rope to the ceiling and strangle themselves, then let them see if this plan will do away with ˹the cause of˺ their rage.[[\u00A0Meaning, no matter what the deniers do, Allah will never stop supporting His Prophet (ﷺ).]]\u00A0",

  "Do you not see that to Allah bow down ˹in submission˺[[\u00A0lit., prostrate.

But the Sacred Mosque is unique in that intending to sin in it is sufficient to bring punishment from Allah, unless the person repents. ]]\u00A0We will cause them to taste a painful punishment.",
  "And ˹remember˺ when We assigned to Abraham the site of the House, ˹saying,˺ “Do not associate anything with Me ˹in worship˺ and purify My House for those who circle ˹the Ka’bah˺, stand ˹in prayer˺, and bow and prostrate themselves.",

  "That is so. And whoever honours the rituals of Allah, it is best for them in the sight of their Lord. The ˹meat of˺ cattle has been made lawful for you, except what has ˹already˺ been recited to you.[[\u00A0See\u00A0{5:3}.]]\u00A0So shun the impurity of idolatry, and shun words of falsehood.",
  "Be upright ˹in devotion˺ to Allah, associating none with Him ˹in worship˺. For whoever associates ˹others˺ with Allah is like someone who has fallen from the sky and is either snatched away by birds or swept by the wind to a remote place.",

  "Neither their meat nor blood reaches Allah. Rather, it is your piety that reaches Him. This is how He has subjected them to you so that you may proclaim the greatness of Allah for what He has guided you to, and give good news to the good-doers.",

  "Now, throw down your staff!” But when he saw it slithering like a snake, he ran away without looking back. ˹Allah reassured him,˺ “O Moses! Do not be afraid! Messengers should have no fear in My presence.",

  "But when Our enlightening signs came to them, they said, “This is pure magic.”",

  "Indeed, We granted knowledge to David and Solomon. And they said ˹in acknowledgment˺, “All praise is for Allah Who has privileged us over many of His faithful servants.”[[\u00A0The privilege was their ability to communicate with members of the animal kingdom, control the wind, utilize the jinn for their service, etc. ]]",
  "And David was succeeded by Solomon, who said, “O people! We have been taught the language of birds, and been given everything ˹we need˺. This is indeed a great privilege.”",
  "Solomon’s forces of jinn, humans, and birds were rallied for him, perfectly organized.",
  "And when they came across a valley of ants, an ant warned, “O ants! Go quickly into your homes so Solomon and his armies do not crush you, unknowingly.”",
  "So Solomon smiled in amusement at her words, and prayed, “My Lord! Inspire me to ˹always˺ be thankful for Your favours which You have blessed me and my parents with, and to do good deeds that please you. Admit me, by Your mercy, into ˹the company of˺ Your righteous servants.”",
  "˹One day˺ he inspected the birds, and wondered, “Why is it that I cannot see the hoopoe? Or could he be absent?",
  "I will surely subject him to a severe punishment, or ˹even˺ slaughter him, unless he brings me a compelling excuse.”",
  "It was not long before the bird came and said, “I have found out something you do not know. I have just come to you from Sheba with sure news.",
  "Indeed, I found a woman ruling over them,[[\u00A0The Queen of Sheba is known in Islamic tradition as Bilkis. ]]\u00A0who has been given everything ˹she needs˺, and who has a magnificent throne.",
  "I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of Allah. For Satan has made their deeds appealing to them—hindering them from the ˹Right˺ Way and leaving them unguided—",
  "so they do not prostrate to Allah, Who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you ˹all˺ conceal and what you reveal.",
  "˹He is˺ Allah! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.”",
  "Solomon said, “We will see whether you are telling the truth or lying.",
  "Go with this letter of mine and deliver it to them, then stand aside and see how they will respond.”",
  "The Queen ˹later˺ announced, “O chiefs! Indeed, a noble letter has been delivered to me.",
  "It is from Solomon, and it reads: ‘In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.",
  "Do not be arrogant with me, but come to me, fully submitting ˹to Allah˺.’”",
  "She said, “O chiefs! Advise me in this matter of mine, for I would never make any decision without you.”",
  "They responded, “We are a people of strength and great ˹military˺ might, but the decision is yours, so decide what you will command.”",
  "She reasoned, “Indeed, when kings invade a land, they ruin it and debase its nobles. They really do so!",
  "But I will certainly send him a gift, and see what ˹response˺ my envoys will return with.”[[\u00A0She wanted to test Solomon (ﷺ) to see if he was only a king (so he would be satisfied with a tribute) or a prophet (who would only settle with submission to the True God). ]]\u00A0",
  "When the chief-envoy came to him, Solomon said, “Do you offer me wealth? What Allah has granted me is far greater than what He has granted you. No! It is you who rejoice in ˹receiving˺ gifts.",
  "Go back to them, for we will certainly mobilize against them forces which they can never resist, and we will drive them out from there in disgrace, fully humbled.”[[\u00A0If they refuse to submit.]]\u00A0",
  "Solomon asked, “O chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in ˹full˺ submission?”[[\u00A0To explain why Prophet Solomon brought the Queen’s magnificent throne and built the marvellous palace, many traditional commentators cite some folkloric or legendary stories. However, none of these stories is supported by reliable Islamic sources. ]]",
  "One mighty jinn responded, “I can bring it to you before you rise from this council of yours. And I am quite strong and trustworthy for this ˹task˺.”",
  "But the one who had knowledge of the Scripture said,[[\u00A0This refers to ’Aṣif ibn Barkhiya, a knowledgeable and righteous assistant of Solomon. ]]\u00A0“I can bring it to you in the blink of an eye.” So when Solomon saw it placed before him, he exclaimed, “This is by the grace of my Lord to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful, it is only for their own good. But whoever is ungrateful, surely my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Most Generous.”",
  "˹Then˺ Solomon said, “Disguise her throne for her so we may see whether she will recognize ˹it˺ or she will not be able to.”",
  "So when she arrived, it was said ˹to her˺, “Is your throne like this?” She replied, “It looks to be the same. We have ˹already˺ received knowledge ˹of Solomon’s prophethood˺[[\u00A0Because he had refused her tribute. ]]\u00A0before this ˹miracle˺,[[\u00A0Bringing her well-guarded, mighty throne all the way from Sheba, Yemen. ]]\u00A0and have submitted ˹to Allah˺.”",
  "But she had been hindered by what she used to worship instead of Allah, for she was indeed from a disbelieving people.",
  "Then she was told, “Enter the palace.” But when she saw the hall, she thought it was a body of water, so she bared her legs. Solomon said. “It is just a palace paved with crystal.” ˹At last˺ she declared, “My Lord! I have certainly wronged my soul. Now I ˹fully˺ submit myself along with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of all worlds.”",
  "And We certainly sent to the people of Thamûd their brother Ṣâliḥ, proclaiming, “Worship Allah,” but they suddenly split into two opposing groups.[[\u00A0i.e., believers and disbelievers. ]]",
  "He urged ˹the disbelieving group˺, “O my people! Why do you ˹seek to˺ hasten the torment[[\u00A0lit., the evil.]]\u00A0rather than grace?[[\u00A0lit., the good. ]]\u00A0If only you sought Allah’s forgiveness so you may be shown mercy!”",
  "They replied, “You and your followers are a bad omen for us.”[[\u00A0They were struck with famine, which they blamed on Ṣâliḥ and his followers.]]\u00A0He responded, “Your omens are destined by Allah. In fact, you are ˹only˺ a people being tested.”",
  "And there were in the city nine ˹elite˺ men who spread corruption in the land, never doing what is right.",
  "They vowed, “Let us swear by Allah that we will take him and his family down by night. Then we will certainly say to his ˹closest˺ heirs, ‘We did not witness the murder of his family. We are definitely telling the truth.’”",
  "And ˹so˺ they made a plan, but We too made a plan, while they were unaware.",
  "See then what the consequences of their plan were: We ˹utterly˺ destroyed them and their people all together.",
  "So their homes are there, ˹but completely˺ ruined because of their wrongdoing. Surely in this is a lesson for people of knowledge.",
  "And We delivered those who were faithful and were mindful ˹of Allah˺.",
  "And ˹remember˺ Lot, when he rebuked ˹the men of˺ his people, “Do you commit that shameful deed while you can see ˹one another˺?",
  "Do you really lust after men instead of women? In fact, you are ˹only˺ a people acting ignorantly.”",
  "But his people’s only response was to say, “Expel Lot’s followers from your land! They are a people who wish to remain chaste!”",
  "So We delivered him and his family, except his wife. We had destined her to be one of the doomed.",

  "˹One day˺ he entered the city unnoticed by its people.[[\u00A0In his adulthood, Moses and Pharaoh’s people were not on good terms because he started to question their evil practices.]]\u00A0There he found two men fighting: one of his own people, and the other of his enemies. The man from his people called to him for help against his foe. So Moses punched him, causing his death. Moses cried, “This is from Satan’s handiwork. He is certainly a sworn, misleading enemy.”",
  "He pleaded, “My Lord! I have definitely wronged my soul, so forgive me.” So He forgave him, ˹for˺ He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
  "Moses pledged, “My Lord! For all Your favours upon me, I will never side with the wicked.”",
  "And so Moses became fearful, watching out in the city, when suddenly the one who sought his help the day before cried out to him again for help. Moses rebuked him, “Indeed, you are clearly a trouble-maker.”",
  "Then when Moses was about to lay his hands on their foe,[[\u00A0The man assumed that Moses was going to hit him. ]]\u00A0the enemy said, “O Moses! Do you intend to kill me as you killed a man yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land. You do not intend to make peace!”",
  "And there came a man, rushing from the farthest end of the city. He said, “O Moses! The chiefs are actually conspiring against you to put you to death, so leave ˹the city˺. I really advise you ˹to do so˺.”",
  "So Moses left the city in a state of fear and caution, praying, “My Lord! Deliver me from the wrongdoing people.”",
  "And as he made his way towards Midian, he said, “I trust my Lord will guide me to the right way.”",
  "When he arrived at the well of Midian, he found a group of people watering ˹their herds˺. Apart from them, he noticed two women holding back ˹their herd˺. He asked ˹them˺, “What is the problem?” They replied, “We cannot water ˹our animals˺ until the ˹other˺ shepherds are done, for our father is a very old man.”",
  "So he watered ˹their herd˺ for them, then withdrew to the shade and prayed, “My Lord! I am truly in ˹desperate˺ need of whatever provision You may have in store for me.”[[\u00A0Moses left Egypt with no food, money, or even shoes. He was completely worn out by the time he arrived in Midian. After he prayed for help, Allah gave him a wife, a job, and a home on the same day. ]]\u00A0",
  "Then one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully. She said, “My father is inviting you so he may reward you for watering ˹our animals˺ for us.” When Moses came to him and told him his whole story, the old man said, “Have no fear! You are ˹now˺ safe from the wrongdoing people.”",
  "One of the two daughters suggested, “O my dear father! Hire him. The best man for employment is definitely the strong and trustworthy ˹one˺.”",
  "The old man proposed, “I wish to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you, provided that you stay in my service for eight years. If you complete ten, it will be ˹a favour˺ from you, but I do not wish to make it difficult for you. Allah willing, you will find me an agreeable man.”",
  "Moses responded, “˹Then˺ it is ˹settled˺ between you and I. Whichever term I fulfill, there will be no ˹further˺ obligation on me. And Allah is a Witness to what we say.”",
  "When Moses had completed the term and was travelling with his family, he spotted a fire on the side of Mount Ṭûr. He said to his family, “Stay here, ˹for˺ I have spotted a fire. Perhaps from there I can bring you some directions[[\u00A0lit., information. Moses and his family lost their way in the dark while they were travelling from Midian to Egypt. ]]\u00A0or a torch from the fire so you may warm yourselves.”",
  "But when he came to it, he was called from the bush in the sacred ground to the right side of the valley: “O Moses! It is truly I. I am Allah—the Lord of all worlds.",
  "Now, throw down your staff!” But when he saw it slithering like a snake, he ran away without looking back. ˹Allah reassured him,˺ “O Moses! Draw near, and have no fear. You are perfectly secure.",
  "Now put your hand through ˹the opening of˺ your collar, it will come out ˹shining˺ white, unblemished.[[\u00A0See\u00A0footnote for {20:22}. ]]\u00A0And cross your arms tightly to calm your fears.[[\u00A0When Moses put his arm through the opening in his collar again, his hand returned to its original colour. ]]\u00A0These are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. They have truly been a rebellious people.”",
  "Moses appealed, “My Lord! I have indeed killed a man from them, so I fear they may kill me.",
  "And my brother Aaron is more eloquent than I, so send him with me as a helper to support what I say, for I truly fear they may reject me.”",
  "Allah responded, “We will assist you with your brother and grant you both authority, so they cannot harm you. With Our signs, you and those who follow you will ˹certainly˺ prevail.”",
  "But when Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said ˹arrogantly˺, “This is nothing but conjured magic ˹tricks˺. We have never heard of this in ˹the history of˺ our forefathers.”",
  "Moses responded, “My Lord knows best who has come with ˹true˺ guidance from Him and will fare best in the end. Indeed, the wrongdoers will never succeed.”",
  "Pharaoh declared, “O chiefs! I know of no other god for you but myself. So bake bricks out of clay for me, O \u00A0Hamân, and build a high tower so I may look at the God of Moses, although I am sure he is a liar.”",
  "And so he and his soldiers behaved arrogantly in the land with no right, thinking they would never be returned to Us.",
  "So We seized him and his soldiers, casting\u00A0them into the sea. See then what was the end of the wrongdoers!",
  "We made them leaders inviting ˹others˺ to the Fire. And on the Day of Judgment they will not be helped.",
  "We caused a curse to follow them in this world. And on the Day of Judgment they will be among the outcasts.",
  "Indeed, We gave Moses the Scripture—after destroying earlier nations—as an insight for the people, a guide, and mercy so perhaps they would be mindful.",
  "You were not there ˹O Prophet˺ on the western side of the mountain when We entrusted the Commandments to Moses, nor were you present ˹in his time˺.[[\u00A0The pagans are reminded repeatedly in the Quran that the Prophet (ﷺ) did not witness any of these events that happened centuries before he was born. For example, the conspiracies that were made against Joseph ({12:102}), the dispute on who should be the guardian of young Mary ({3:44}), and the drowning of Noah’s son in the Flood ({11:49}). These details were not known to Arabs before the revelation of the Quran. So the only logical way that the Prophet (ﷺ) knew about these stories is through divine revelation. ]]",
  "But We ˹later˺ raised ˹several˺ generations, and the ages took their toll on them.[[\u00A0So they neglected the Commandments over time. ]]\u00A0Nor were you living among the people of Midian, rehearsing Our revelations with them. But it is We Who have sent ˹this\u00A0revelation to you˺.",
  "And you were not at the side of Mount Ṭûr when We called out ˹to Moses˺. But ˹you have been sent˺ as a mercy from your Lord to warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, so perhaps they may be mindful.",
  "Also so they would not say, if struck by an affliction for what their hands have done: “Our Lord! If only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations and become believers.”",
  "But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “If only he was given the like of what Moses had been given.”[[\u00A0The pagans of Mecca demanded that the Quran should have been revealed all at once like the Torah, and the Prophet (ﷺ) should have had some tangible signs like the staff of Moses. ]]\u00A0Did they not deny what had been given to Moses earlier? They claimed, “Both ˹Scriptures˺ are works of magic, supporting each other!”[[\u00A0Some Meccan pagans approached some Jewish authorities to inquire about the Prophet’s message and they were told that there are references of him in the Torah. So the pagans immediately rejected both the Torah and the Quran as two works of magic. ]]\u00A0Adding, “We truly deny both.”",
  "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Bring then a scripture from Allah which is a better guide than these two so I may follow it, if your claim is true.”",
  "So if they fail to respond to you, then know that they only follow their desires. And who could be more astray than those who follow their desires with no guidance from Allah? Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",

  "When they hear slanderous talk, they turn away from it, saying, “We are accountable for our deeds and you for yours. Peace ˹is our only response˺ to you! We want nothing to do with those who act ignorantly.”",
  "You surely cannot guide whoever you like ˹O Prophet˺, but it is Allah Who guides whoever He wills, and He knows best who are ˹fit to be˺ guided.",
  "They say ˹to the Prophet˺, “If we were to follow ˹true˺ guidance with you, we would certainly be snatched away from our land.” Have We not established for them a safe haven ˹in Mecca˺ to which fruits of all kinds are brought as a provision from Us? But most of them do not know ˹this favour˺.",
  "˹Imagine˺ how many societies We have destroyed that had been spoiled by their ˹comfortable˺ living! Those are their residences, never inhabited after them except passingly.[[\u00A0By travellers such as the Meccan pagans.]]\u00A0And We ˹alone˺ were the Successor.",

  "It will be said ˹to the disbelievers˺, “Call upon your associate-gods ˹for help˺.” So they will call them, but will receive no response. And they will face the punishment, wishing they had been ˹rightly˺ guided!",

  "And We will bring forth a witness[[\u00A0A prophet. ]]\u00A0from every faith-community and ask ˹the polytheists˺, “Show ˹Us˺ your proof.” Then they will ˹come to˺ know that the truth is with Allah ˹alone˺. And whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them.",
  "Indeed, Korah[[\u00A0Korah was the cousin of Moses. Because of Korah’s close association with Pharaoh, he became very rich and started to behave arrogantly towards his own people. When he was asked repeatedly by Moses (ﷺ) to pay his alms-tax to help poor Israelites, Korah refused and eventually conspired with a prostitute to damage the reputation of Moses, but Moses was cleared of any wrongdoing. ]]\u00A0was from the people of Moses, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. We had granted him such treasures that even their keys would burden a group of strong men. ˹Some of˺ his people advised him, “Do not be prideful! Surely Allah does not like the prideful.",
  "Rather, seek the ˹reward˺ of the Hereafter by means of what Allah has granted you, without forgetting your share of this world. And be good ˹to others˺ as Allah has been good to you. Do not seek to spread corruption in the land, for Allah certainly does not like the corruptors.”",
  "He replied, “I have been granted all this because of some knowledge I have.”[[\u00A0Or: “I have been granted all this because I know that Allah knows I deserve it.” ]]\u00A0Did he not know that Allah had already destroyed some from the generations before him who were far superior to him in power and greater in accumulating ˹wealth˺? There will be no need for the wicked to be asked about their sins.[[\u00A0Since their sins are already known to Allah and written in perfect records, they will only be interrogated as a form of punishment.]]\u00A0",
  "Then he came out before his people in all his glamour. Those who desired the life of this world wished, “If only we could have something like what Korah has been given. He is truly a man of great fortune!”",
  "But those gifted with knowledge said, “Shame on you! Allah’s reward is far better for those who believe and do good. But none will attain this except the steadfast.”",
  "Then We caused the earth to swallow him up, along with his home. There was no one to help him against Allah, nor could he even help himself.",
  "And those who had craved his position the previous day began to say, “Ah! It is certainly Allah Who gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. Had it not been for the grace of Allah, He could have surely caused the earth to swallow us up! Oh, indeed! The disbelievers will never succeed.”",
  "That ˹eternal˺ Home in the Hereafter We reserve ˹only˺ for those who seek neither tyranny nor corruption on the earth. The ultimate outcome belongs ˹only˺ to the righteous.",

  "Lot prayed, “My Lord! Help me against the people of corruption.”",
  "When Our messenger-angels came to Abraham with the good news ˹of the birth of Isaac˺, they said, “We are going to destroy the people of this city ˹of Sodom˺, for its people have persisted in wrongdoing.”",

  "But they rejected him, so an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them and they fell lifeless in their homes.",
  "And the people of ’Ȃd and Thamûd ˹met a similar fate˺, which must be clear to you ˹Meccans˺ from their ruins.[[\u00A0Meccan caravans always passed by these ruins on the way\u00A0to Yemen and Syria for business. ]]\u00A0Satan made their ˹evil˺ deeds appealing to them, hindering them from the ˹Right˺ Way, although they were capable of reasoning.",
  "˹We˺ also ˹destroyed˺ Korah, Pharaoh, and Hamân. Indeed, Moses had come to them with clear proofs, but they behaved arrogantly in the land. Yet they could not escape ˹Us˺.",
  "So We seized each ˹people˺ for their sin: against some of them We sent a storm of stones, some were overtaken by a ˹mighty˺ blast, some We caused the earth to swallow, and some We drowned. Allah would not have wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.",

  "Allah created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. Surely in this is a sign for the people of faith.",

  "So He may reward those who believe and do good. It is they who will have forgiveness and an honourable provision.",
  "As for those who strive to discredit Our revelations, it is they who will suffer the ˹worst˺ torment of agonizing pain.",
  "Those gifted with knowledge ˹clearly˺ see that what has been revealed to you from your Lord ˹O Prophet˺ is the truth, and that it guides to the Path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy.",
  "The disbelievers say ˹mockingly to one another˺, “Shall we show you a man who claims that when you have been utterly disintegrated you will be raised as a new creation?",
  "Has he fabricated a lie against Allah or is he insane?” In fact, those who do not believe in the Hereafter are bound for torment and have strayed farthest ˹from the truth˺.",
  "Have they not then seen all that surrounds them of the heavens and the earth? If We willed, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, or cause ˹deadly˺ pieces of the sky to fall upon them. Surely in this is a sign for every servant who turns ˹to Allah˺.",
  "Indeed, We granted David a ˹great˺ privilege from Us, ˹commanding:˺ “O mountains! Echo his hymns! And the birds as well.” We made iron mouldable for him,",
  "instructing: “Make full-length armour, ˹perfectly˺ balancing the links. And work righteousness ˹O family of David!˺. Indeed, I am All-Seeing of what you do.”",
  "And to Solomon ˹We subjected˺ the wind: its morning stride was a month’s journey and so was its evening stride. And We caused a stream of molten copper to flow for him, and ˹We subjected˺ some of the jinn to work under him by his Lord’s Will. And whoever of them deviated from Our command, We made them taste the torment of the blaze.",
  "They made for him whatever he desired of sanctuaries, statues,[[\u00A0Which was permissible at the time of Solomon (ﷺ). ]]\u00A0basins as large as reservoirs, and cooking pots fixed ˹into the ground˺. ˹We ordered:˺ “Work gratefully, O \u00A0family of David!” ˹Only˺ a few of My servants are ˹truly˺ grateful.",
  "When We decreed Solomon’s death, nothing indicated to the ˹subjected˺ jinn that he was dead except the termites eating away his staff.[[\u00A0Which he died while leaning on. ]]\u00A0So when he collapsed, the jinn realized that if they had ˹really˺ known the unseen, they would not have remained in ˹such˺ humiliating servitude.",
  "Indeed, there was a sign for ˹the tribe of˺ Sheba in their homeland: two orchards—one to the right and the other to the left. ˹They were told:˺ “Eat from the provision of your Lord, and be grateful to Him. ˹Yours is˺ a good land and a forgiving Lord.”",
  "But they turned away. So We sent against them a devastating flood, and replaced their orchards with two others producing bitter fruit, fruitless bushes,[[\u00A0lit., tamarisks.\u00A0]]\u00A0and a few ˹sparse˺ thorny trees.[[\u00A0lit., lote trees. ]]",
  "This is how We rewarded them for their ingratitude. Would We ever punish ˹anyone in such a way˺ except the ungrateful?",
  "We had also placed between them and the cities[[\u00A0i.e., Mecca and Jerusalem. ]]\u00A0We showered with blessings ˹many small˺ towns within sight of one another. And We set moderate travel distances in between, ˹saying,˺ “Travel between them by day and night safely.”",
  "But they said, “Our Lord! Make ˹the distances of˺ our journeys longer,” wronging themselves.[[\u00A0They became bored of living comfortably and traveling easily. A similar example can be found in {2:61}, where the Children of Israel became bored with the manna and quails and wanted to eat other things such as onions and garlic. ]]\u00A0So We reduced them to ˹cautionary˺ tales, and scattered them utterly. Surely in this are lessons for whoever is steadfast, grateful.",
  "Indeed, Iblîs’ assumption about them has come true,[[\u00A0Iblîs was the name of Satan before his fall from grace (see footnote for {2:33}). His assumption (or vow) was that he could easily mislead the majority of people (see\u00A0{7:16}-17, {15:39}-40, and {38:82}-83). ]]\u00A0so they ˹all˺ follow him, except a group of ˹true˺ believers.",

  "No intercession will be of any benefit with Him, except by those granted permission by Him. ˹At last,˺ when the dread ˹of Judgment Day˺ is relieved from their hearts ˹because they are permitted to intercede˺, they will ˹excitedly˺ ask ˹the angels˺, “What has your Lord ˹just˺ said?” The angels will reply, “The truth!

  "We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ only as a deliverer of good news and a warner to all of humanity, but most people do not know.",
  "And they ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is true?”",
  "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “A Day has ˹already˺ been appointed for you, which you can neither delay nor advance by a ˹single˺ moment.”",
  "The disbelievers vow, “We will never believe in this Quran, nor in those ˹Scriptures˺ before it.” If only you could see when the wrongdoers will be detained before their Lord, throwing blame at each other! The lowly ˹followers˺ will say to the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “Had it not been for you, we would certainly have been believers.”",
  "The arrogant will respond to the lowly, “Did we ever hinder you from guidance after it came to you? In fact, you were wicked ˹on your own˺.”",
  "The lowly will say to the arrogant, “No! It was your plotting by day and night—when you ordered us to disbelieve in Allah and to set up equals with Him.” They will ˹all˺ hide ˹their˺ remorse when they see the torment. And We will put shackles around the necks of the disbelievers. Will they be rewarded except for what they used to do?",
  "Whenever We sent a warner to a society, its elite would say, “We truly reject what you have been sent with.”",
  "Adding, “We are far superior ˹to the believers˺ in wealth and children, and we will never be punished.”",
  "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely ˹it is˺ my Lord ˹Who˺ gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. But most people do not know.”",
  "It is not your wealth or children that bring you closer to Us. But those who believe and do good—it is they who will have a multiplied reward for what they did, and they will be secure in ˹elevated˺ mansions.",
  "As for those who strive to discredit Our revelations, it is they who will be confined in punishment.",
  "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely ˹it is˺ my Lord ˹Who˺ gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. And whatever you spend in charity, He will compensate ˹you˺ for it. For He is the Best Provider.”",
  "And ˹consider˺ the Day He will gather them all together, and then ask the angels, “Was it you that these ˹polytheists˺ used to worship?”",
  "They will say, “Glory be to You! Our loyalty is to You, not them. In fact, they ˹only˺ followed the ˹temptations of evil˺ jinn,[[\u00A0i.e., the devils. ]]\u00A0in whom most of them had faith.”",
  "So Today neither of you can benefit or protect each other. And We will say to the wrongdoers, “Taste the torment of the Fire, which you used to deny.”",
  "When Our clear revelations are recited to them, they say, “This is only a man who wishes to hinder you from what your forefathers used to worship.” They also say, “This ˹Quran˺ is no more than a fabricated lie.” And the disbelievers say of the truth when it has come to them, “This is nothing but pure magic.”",
  "˹They say so even though˺ We had never given them any scriptures to study, nor did We ever send them a warner before you ˹O Prophet˺.",
  "Those ˹destroyed˺ before them denied as well—and these ˹Meccans˺ have not attained even one-tenth of what We had given their predecessors.[[\u00A0Like the people of Pharaoh, ’Ȃd, and Thamûd. ]]\u00A0Yet ˹when˺ they denied My messengers, how severe was My response!",

  "O humanity! Indeed, Allah’s promise is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver[[\u00A0Satan. ]]\u00A0deceive you about Allah.",
  "Surely Satan is an enemy to you, so take him as an enemy. He only invites his followers to become inmates of the Blaze.",
  "Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment. But those who believe and do good will have forgiveness and a great reward.",
  "Are those whose evil-doing is made so appealing to them that they deem it good ˹like those who are rightly guided˺? ˹It is˺ certainly Allah ˹Who˺ leaves to stray whoever He wills, and guides whoever He wills.

  "And it is Allah Who sends the winds, which then stir up ˹vapour, forming˺ clouds, and then We drive them to a lifeless land, giving life to the earth after its death. Similar is the Resurrection.",

  "There they will be ˹fervently˺ screaming, “Our Lord! Take us out ˹and send us back˺. We will do good, unlike what we used to do.” ˹They will be told,˺ “Did We not give you lives long enough so that whoever wanted to be mindful could have done so? And the warner came to you. So taste ˹the punishment˺, for the wrongdoers have no helper.”",
  "Indeed, Allah is the Knower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth. He surely knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.",
  "He is the One Who has placed you as successors on earth. So whoever disbelieves will bear ˹the burden of˺ their own disbelief. The disbelievers’ denial only increases them in contempt in the sight of their Lord, and it will only contribute to their loss.",

Are they equal in condition?[[\u00A0The slave owned by several quarrelsome masters will always be confused because their masters will always give them conflicting orders—similarly, one who worships multiple gods will never find peace between them.

As long as you call upon Me, putting your hope in Me, I will forgive you for what you have done, and I will not mind. O \u00A0children of Adam! If your sins were to reach the clouds of the sky and then you sought My forgiveness, I would ˹still˺ forgive you. O \u00A0children of Adam!

  "Whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, the disbelievers say of the truth when it has come to them, “This is pure magic.”",
  "Or do they say, “He[[\u00A0Muḥammad (ﷺ). ]]\u00A0has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If I have done so, then there is nothing whatsoever you can do to save me from Allah. He knows best what ˹slurs˺ you indulge about it. Sufficient is He as a Witness between you and me. And He is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”",

Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.”",
  "The disbelievers say of the believers, “Had it been ˹something˺ good, they[[\u00A0Poor and powerless Muslims. ]]\u00A0would not have beaten us to it.” Now since they reject its guidance, they will say, “˹This is˺ an ancient fabrication!”",
  "And before this ˹Quran˺ the Book of Moses was ˹revealed as˺ a guide and mercy. And this Book is a confirmation, in the Arabic tongue, to warn those who do wrong, and as good news to those who do good.",
  "Surely those who say, “Our Lord is Allah,” and then remain steadfast—there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.",
  "It is they who will be the residents of Paradise, staying there forever, as a reward for what they used to do.",
  "We have commanded people to honour their parents. Their mothers bore them in hardship and delivered them in hardship. Their ˹period of˺ bearing and weaning is thirty months. In time, when the child reaches their prime at the age of forty, they pray, “My Lord! Inspire me to ˹always˺ be thankful for Your favours which You blessed me and my parents with, and to do good deeds that please You. And instil righteousness in my offspring. I truly repent to You, and I truly submit ˹to Your Will˺.”",
  "It is from these ˹people˺ that We will accept the good they did, and overlook their misdeeds—along with the residents of Paradise, ˹in fulfilment of˺ the true promise they have been given.",
  "But some scold their parents, “Enough with you! Are you warning me that I will be brought forth ˹from the grave˺, while many generations had already perished before me ˹for good˺?” The parents cry to Allah for help, ˹and warn their child,˺ “Pity you. Have faith! Surely Allah’s promise is true.” But the deniers insist, “This is nothing but ancient fables.”",
  "These are the ones against whom the fate of earlier communities of jinn and humans has been justified, ˹for˺ they were truly losers.",
  "Each ˹of the two groups˺ will be ranked according to what they have done so He may fully reward all. And none will be wronged.",
  "˹Watch for˺ the Day ˹when˺ the disbelievers will be exposed to the Fire. ˹They will be told,˺ “You ˹already˺ exhausted your ˹share of˺ pleasures during your worldly life, and ˹fully˺ enjoyed them. So Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for your arrogance throughout the land with no right, and for your rebelliousness.”",
  "And remember the brother of ’Ȃd, when he warned his people, who inhabited the sand-hills[[\u00A0The people of ’Ȃd were the residents of the hills in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula.]]—there were certainly warners before and after him—˹saying,˺ “Worship none but Allah. I truly fear for you the torment of a tremendous day.”",
  "They argued, “Have you come to turn us away from our gods? Bring us then whatever you threaten us with, if what you say is true.”",
  "He responded, “The knowledge ˹of its time˺ is only with Allah. I only convey to you what I have been sent with. But I can see that you are a people acting ignorantly.”",
  "Then when they saw the torment as a ˹dense˺ cloud approaching their valleys, they said ˹happily˺, “This is a cloud bringing us rain.” ˹But Hûd replied,˺ “No, it is what you sought to hasten: a ˹fierce˺ wind carrying a painful punishment!”",
  "It destroyed everything by the command of its Lord, leaving nothing visible except their ruins. This is how We reward the wicked people.",
  "Indeed, We had established them[[\u00A0The people of Hûd. ]]\u00A0in a way We have not established you ˹Meccans˺. And We gave them hearing, sight, and intellect. But neither their hearing, sight, nor intellect were of any benefit to them whatsoever, since they persisted in denying Allah’s signs. And ˹so˺ they were overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule.",
  "We certainly destroyed the societies around you after having varied the signs so perhaps they would return ˹to the Right Path˺.",
  "Why then did those ˹idols˺ they took as gods—hoping to get closer ˹to Him˺—not come to their aid? Instead, they failed them. That is ˹the result of˺ their lies and their fabrications.",
  "˹Remember, O \u00A0Prophet,˺ when We sent a group of jinn your way to listen to the Quran. Then, upon hearing it, they said ˹to one another˺, “Listen quietly!” Then when it was over, they returned to their fellow jinn as warners.",
  "They declared, “O our fellow jinn! We have truly heard a scripture revealed after Moses, confirming what came before it. It guides to the truth and the Straight Way.",
  "O \u00A0our fellow jinn! Respond to the caller of Allah and believe in him, He will forgive your sins and protect you from a painful punishment.",
  "And whoever does not respond to the caller of Allah will have no escape on earth, nor will they have any protectors against Him. It is they who are clearly astray.”",
  "Do they not realize that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and did not tire in creating them,[[\u00A0Or never failed in creating them. ]]\u00A0is able to give life to the dead? Yes ˹indeed˺! He is certainly Most Capable of everything.",
  "And on the Day the disbelievers will be exposed to the Fire, ˹they will be asked,˺ “Is this ˹Hereafter˺ not the truth?” They will cry, “Absolutely, by our Lord!” It will be said, “Then taste the punishment for your disbelief.”",
  "So endure patiently, as did the Messengers of Firm Resolve.[[\u00A0Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muḥammad are called the Messengers of Firm Resolve.]]\u00A0And do not ˹seek to˺ hasten ˹the torment˺ for the deniers. On the Day they see what they have been threatened with, it will be as if they had only stayed ˹in this world˺ for an hour of a day.[[\u00A0i.e., only for a very short period of time. ]]\u00A0˹This is˺ a ˹sufficient˺ warning! Then, will anyone be destroyed except the rebellious people?",
  "Those who disbelieve and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, He will render their deeds void.",
  "As for those who believe, do good, and have faith in what has been revealed to Muḥammad—which is the truth from their Lord—He will absolve them of their sins and improve their condition.",
  "This is because the disbelievers follow falsehood, while the believers follow the truth from their Lord. This is how Allah shows people their true state ˹of faith˺.",
  "So when you meet the disbelievers ˹in battle˺, strike ˹their˺ necks until you have thoroughly subdued them, then bind them firmly. Later ˹free them either as˺ an act of grace or by ransom until the war comes to an end. So will it be. Had Allah willed, He ˹Himself˺ could have inflicted punishment on them. But He does ˹this only to˺ test some of you by means of others. And those who are martyred in the cause of Allah,[[\u00A0Another possible interpretation: “And those who fight in the cause of Allah.”]]\u00A0He will never render their deeds void.",
  "He will guide them ˹to their reward˺, improve their condition,",

  "O believers! If you stand up for Allah, He will help you and make your steps firm.",
  "As for the disbelievers, may they be doomed and may He render their deeds void.",
  "That is because they detest what Allah has revealed, so He has rendered their deeds void.",
  "Have they not travelled throughout the land to see what was the end of those before them? Allah annihilated them, and a similar fate awaits the disbelievers.",
  "This is because Allah is the Patron of the believers while the disbelievers have no patron.",
  "Surely Allah will admit those who believe and do good into Gardens under which rivers flow. As for the disbelievers, they enjoy themselves and feed like cattle.[[\u00A0Meaning, the disbelievers enjoy their life to the fullest while they are heedless of what will happen to them in the Hereafter, just like the cattle that graze in the pasture are unaware that they will probably end up in the slaughter house. ]]\u00A0But the Fire will be their home.",
  "˹Imagine, O \u00A0Prophet,˺ how many societies We destroyed that were far superior in might than your society—which drove you out—and there was none to help them!",
  "Can those ˹believers˺ who stand on clear proof from their Lord be like those whose evil deeds are made appealing to them and ˹only˺ follow their desires?",
  "The description of the Paradise promised to the righteous is that in it are rivers of fresh water, rivers of milk that never changes in taste, rivers of wine delicious to drink, and rivers of pure honey. There they will ˹also˺ have all kinds of fruit, and forgiveness from their Lord. ˹Can they be˺ like those who will stay in the Fire forever, left to drink boiling water that will tear apart their insides?",
  "There are some of them who listen to you ˹O Prophet˺, but when they depart from you, they say ˹mockingly˺ to those ˹believers˺ gifted with knowledge, “What did he just say?” These are the ones whose hearts Allah has sealed and who ˹only˺ follow their desires.",
  "As for those who are ˹rightly˺ guided, He increases them in guidance and blesses them with righteousness.",
  "Are they only waiting for the Hour to take them by surprise? Yet ˹some of˺ its signs have already come.[[\u00A0The coming of Muḥammad (ﷺ) is one of the signs of the Hour. ]]\u00A0Once it actually befalls them, will it not be too late to be mindful?",

It would have been better for them",
  "to obey and speak rightly. Then when fighting was ordained, it surely would have been better for them if they were true to Allah.",
  "Now if you ˹hypocrites˺ turn away, perhaps you would then spread corruption throughout the land and sever your ˹ties of˺ kinship![[\u00A0As you did before Islam. ]]",
  "These are the ones who Allah has condemned, deafening them and blinding their eyes.",
  "Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Or are there locks upon their hearts?",
  "Indeed, those who relapse ˹into disbelief˺ after ˹true˺ guidance has become clear to them, ˹it is˺ Satan ˹that˺ has tempted them, luring them with false hopes.",
  "That is because they said ˹privately˺ to those who ˹also˺ detest what Allah has revealed, “We will obey you in some matters.”[[\u00A0i.e., your opposition to the Prophet (ﷺ). ]]\u00A0But Allah ˹fully˺ knows what they are hiding.",
  "Then how ˹horrible˺ will it be when the angels take their souls, beating their faces and backs!",
  "This is because they follow whatever displeases Allah and hate whatever pleases Him, so He has rendered their deeds void.",
  "Or do those with sickness in their hearts think that Allah will not ˹be able to˺ expose their malice?",
  "Had We willed, We could have truly shown them to you ˹O Prophet˺, and you would have certainly recognized them by their appearance. But you will surely recognize them by their tone of speech. And Allah ˹fully˺ knows your doings ˹O people˺.",
  "We will certainly test you ˹believers˺ until We prove those of you who ˹truly˺ struggle ˹in Allah’s cause˺ and remain steadfast, and reveal how you conduct yourselves.",
  "Indeed, those who disbelieve, hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, and defy the Messenger after ˹true˺ guidance has become clear to them; they will not harm Allah in the least, but He will render their deeds void.",
  "O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and do not let your deeds be in vain.",
  "Surely those who disbelieve, hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, and then die as disbelievers; Allah will never forgive them.",
  "So do not falter or cry for peace, for you will have the upper hand and Allah is with you. And He will never let your deeds go to waste.",
  "This worldly life is no more than play and amusement. But if you are faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, He will grant you your ˹full˺ reward, and will not ask you ˹to donate all˺ your wealth.",
  "If He were to do so and pressure you, you would withhold and He would bring out your resentment.",
  "Here you are, being invited to donate ˹a little˺ in the cause of Allah. Still some of you withhold. And whoever does so, it is only to their own loss. For Allah is the Self-Sufficient, whereas you stand in need ˹of Him˺. If you ˹still˺ turn away, He will replace you with another people. And they will not be like you.",
  "Indeed, We have granted you a clear triumph ˹O Prophet˺[[\u00A0This Medinian sûrah takes its name from the clear triumph (i.e., Treaty of Ḥudaibiyah) in verse 1. The Prophet (ﷺ) and 1400 of his companions travelled to Mecca to perform the minor pilgrimage (’umrah) in 6 A.H./628 C.E. He (ﷺ) sent ’Uthmân ibn ’Affân to let the Meccans know that the Muslims had come in peace, only to visit the Sacred House. When the Meccans delayed ’Uthmân, the Prophet (ﷺ) thought they might have killed his envoy.

He (ﷺ) told her that he had not received any revelation in this regard, and that, based on tradition, she was divorced. She argued that she and her husband had children together who would suffer if their parents were separated. Then she started to plead to Allah as the Prophet (ﷺ) repeated the same answer.

  "O Prophet! ˹Instruct the believers:˺ When you ˹intend to˺ divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period,[[\u00A0Meaning, when a husband intends to divorce his wife—after the consummation of marriage—he should divorce her outside her monthly cycle, provided that he has not touched her after her period. This makes it easy for the wife to observe her ’iddah\u00A0(waiting period for around three months, see\u00A0{65:4}). Otherwise, things will be complicated for her. For example, if divorce happens after sexual intercourse, she might get pregnant, which delays the end of ’iddah\u00A0until the end of her pregnancy. If divorce happens during a monthly cycle, scholars are in disagreement as to whether the divorce counts or not. If it does not, she has to wait until her menstruation is over to see if her husband still wants to divorce her. ]]\u00A0and count it accurately. And\u00A0fear Allah, your Lord. Do not force them out of their homes, nor should they leave—unless they commit a blatant misconduct. These are the limits set by Allah. And whoever transgresses Allah’s limits has truly wronged his own soul. You never know, perhaps Allah will bring about a change ˹of heart˺ later.[[\u00A0Perhaps the husband who has divorced his wife may change his mind and restore the marriage before the end of her waiting period (after the first or second count of revocable divorce). ]]\u00A0",
  "Then when they have ˹almost˺ reached the end of their waiting period, either retain them honourably or separate from them honourably.[[\u00A0A husband may separate from his wife after each of the first two counts of divorce or at the end of her waiting period with dignity. If he chooses to stay with her after the first two counts of divorce then divorces her a third time, the marriage is terminated at the end of her third waiting period. The wife will have to marry and divorce another man before she can be remarried to her ex-husband (see\u00A0{2:230}). However, a woman marrying someone with the intention of getting divorced, in order to return to her first husband, is forbidden. ]]\u00A0And call two of your reliable men to witness ˹either way˺—and ˹let the witnesses˺ bear true testimony for ˹the sake of˺ Allah. This is enjoined on whoever has faith in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make a way out for them,",
  "and provide for them from sources they could never imagine. And whoever puts their trust in Allah, then He ˹alone˺ is sufficient for them. Certainly Allah achieves His Will. Allah has already set a destiny for everything.",
  "As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not know, their waiting period is three months, and those who have not menstruated as well. As for those who are pregnant, their waiting period ends with delivery.[[\u00A0This applies to pregnant women who are divorced or widowed. ]]\u00A0And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make their matters easy for them.",
  "This is the commandment of Allah, which He has revealed to you. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will absolve them of their sins and reward them immensely.",
  "Let them live where you live ˹during their waiting period˺, according to your means. And do not harass them to make their stay unbearable. If they are pregnant, then maintain them until they deliver. And if they nurse your child,[[\u00A0After the divorce is finalized. ]]\u00A0compensate them, and consult together courteously. But if you fail to reach an agreement, then another woman will nurse ˹the child˺ for the father.",
  "Let the man of wealth provide according to his means. As for the one with limited resources, let him provide according to whatever Allah has given him. Allah does not require of any soul beyond what He has given it. After hardship, Allah will bring about ease.",
  "˹Imagine˺ how many societies rebelled against the commandments of their Lord and His messengers, so We called each ˹society˺ to a severe account and subjected them to a horrible punishment.",
  "So they tasted the evil consequences of their doings, and the outcome of their doings was ˹total˺ loss.",
  "Allah has ˹also˺ prepared for them a severe punishment. So fear Allah, O \u00A0people of reason and faith. Allah has indeed revealed to you a Reminder,[[\u00A0This is one of the names of the Quran. ]]",

  "˹Remember˺ when the Prophet had ˹once˺ confided something to one of his wives, then when she disclosed it ˹to another wife˺ and Allah made it known to him, he presented ˹to her˺ part of what was disclosed and overlooked a part. So when he informed her of it, she exclaimed, “Who told you this?” He replied, “I was informed by the All-Knowing, All-Aware.”",
  "˹It will be better˺ if you ˹wives˺ both turn to Allah in repentance, for your hearts have certainly faltered. But if you ˹continue to˺ collaborate against him, then ˹know that˺ Allah Himself is his Guardian. And Gabriel, the righteous believers, and the angels are ˹all˺ his supporters as well.",

  "O believers! Turn to Allah in sincere repentance, so your Lord may absolve you of your sins and admit you into Gardens, under which rivers flow, on the Day Allah will not disgrace the Prophet or the believers with him.

  "O Prophet! Struggle against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm with them. Hell will be their home. What an evil destination!",

Noah’s wife used to give away the identity of the new believers so the disbelievers could persecute them.

Both were told, “Enter the Fire, along with the others!”",

Since the Prophet (ﷺ) was unlettered, he responded, “I cannot read.” Ultimately, Gabriel taught him: “Read in the Name of your Lord …” Some scholars believe that this encounter is the fulfilment of Isaiah {29:12}, which states, “Then the book will be given to the one who is illiterate, saying, ‘Read this.’ And he will say, ‘I cannot read.’”]]\u00A0",
