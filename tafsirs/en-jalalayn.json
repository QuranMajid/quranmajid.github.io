  "In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:",
  "Praise be to God, is a predicate of a nominal clause, the content of which is intended to extol God [by stating that]: He possesses the praise of all creatures, or that He [alone] deserves their praise. God is a proper noun for the One truly worthy of worship; Lord of all Worlds, that is, [He is] the One Who owns all of creation: humans, jinn, angels, animals and others as well, each of which may be referred to as a \u0060world\u0027; one says \u0060the world of men\u0027, or \u0060world of the jinn\u0027 etc. This plural form with the y\u0027 and the nn [sc. \u0060lamn] is used to denote, predominantly, cognizant beings (l \u0060ilm). The expression [\u0060lamn] relates to [the term] \u0060sign\u0027 (\u0060alma), since it is an indication of the One that created it.",
  "The Compassionate, the Merciful: that is to say, the One who possesses \u0060mercy\u0027, which means to want what is good for those who deserve it.",
  "Master of the Day of Judgement: that is, [the day of] requite, the Day of Resurrection. The reason for the specific mention [of the Day of Judgement] is that the mastery of none shall appear on that Day except that of God, may He be exalted, as is indicated by [God\u0027s words] \u0060Whose is the Kingdom today?\u0027 \u0060God\u0027s\u0027 [Q. 40:16] (if one reads it mlik [as opposed to malik], then this signifies that He has possession of the entire affair on the Day of Resurrection, or else that He is ever described by this [expression], in the same way as [He is described as] \u0060Forgiver of sin\u0027 (ghfir al-dhanb). Thus, one can validly take it as an adjective of a definite noun).",
  "You [alone] we worship, and You [alone] we ask for help: that is to say, we reserve worship for You [alone] by way of acknowledging Your Oneness (tawhd) and so on, and we ask for [Your] assistance in worship and in other things.",
  "Guide us to the straight path: that is, \u0060show us the way to it\u0027. This is substituted by:",
  "the path of those whom You have favoured, with guidance (from alladhna together with its relative clause is substituted by [ghayri l-maghdbi \u0060alayhim]) not [the path] of those against whom there is wrath, namely, the Jews, and nor of those who are astray, namely, the Christians. The subtle meaning implied by this substitution is that the guided ones are neither the Jews nor the Christians. But God knows best what is right, and to Him is the Return and the [final] Resort. May God bless our master Muhammad (s), his Family and Companions and grant them everlasting peace. Sufficient is God for us; an excellent Guardian is He. There is no power and no strength save in God, the High, the Tremendous. Medinese: [consisting of] 286 or 287 verses..",
  "Alif lm mm: God knows best what He means by these [letters].",
  "That, meaning, this, Book, which Muhammad (s) recites, in it there is no doubt, no uncertainty, that it is from God (the negation [l rayba fhi] is the predicate of dhlika; the use of the demonstrative here is intended to glorify [the Book]). A guidance (hud is a second predicate, meaning that it [the Book] \u0060guides\u0027), for the God-fearing, namely, those that tend towards piety by adhering to commands and avoiding things prohibited, thereby guarding themselves from the Fire;",
  "who believe in, that is, who accept the truth of, the Unseen, what is hidden from them of the Resurrection, Paradise and the Fire; and maintain the prayer, that is to say, who perform it giving it its proper due; and of what We have provided them, that is, of what we have bestowed upon them, expend, in obedience to God;",
  "and who believe in what has been revealed to you, namely, the Qur\u0027n; and what was revealed before you, that is, the Torah, the Gospel and other [scriptures]; and of the Hereafter, they are certain, that is, they know [it is real].",
  "Those, as described in the way mentioned, are upon guidance from their Lord, those are the ones that will prosper, that is, who will succeed in entering Paradise and be saved from the Fire.",
  "As for the disbelievers, the likes of Ab Jahl, Ab Lahab and such; alike it is for them whether you have warned them or have not warned them, they do not believe, as God knows very well, so do not hope that they will believe (read a-andhartahum pronouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the second, making it an alif instead, and inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one, or leaving [this insertion]; al-indhr [\u0060warning\u0027] is to give knowledge of something, and simultaneously instil an element of fear).",
  "God has set a seal on their hearts, impressing on them and making certain that no good enters them; and on their hearing, [in which He has] deposited something so that they cannot profit from the truth they hear; and on their eyes is a covering, that is, a veil so that they do not see the truth; and for them there will be a mighty chastisement, that is, intense and everlasting.",
  "The following was revealed concerning the hypocrites: and some people there are who say, \u0060We believe in God and the Last Day\u0027, that is, in the Day of Resurrection because it is the very last day; but they are not believers (the [plural] import of man [in man yaql, \u0060who says\u0027] is taken into account here, as expressed by a pronoun [hum] that expresses this [plural] meaning).",
  "They would deceive God and the believers, by manifesting the opposite of the unbelief they hide, so that they can avoid His rulings in this world; and only themselves they deceive (yukhdi\u0060n), for the evil consequences of their deception will rebound upon them, as they are disgraced in this world when God makes known to His Prophet what they are hiding, and they will be punished in the Hereafter; and they are not aware, and they do not know that they are actually deceiving themselves (mukhda\u0060a [although a third verbal form, from khda\u0060a] actually denotes a one-way action, such as [when one says] \u0060qabtu al-lissa, \u0060I punished the thief\u0027 [using the third verbal form \u0060qaba]; the mention of \u0060God\u0027 in [this statement] is for [rhetorical] effect; a variant reading [for wa-m yukhdi\u0060na] has wa-m yakhda\u0060na).",
  "In their hearts is a sickness: doubt and hypocrisy, which ails their hearts, debilitating them; and God has increased their sickness with what He has revealed in the Qur\u0027n, since they disbelieve it; and there awaits them a painful chastisement because they used to lie (read yukadhdhibn to imply [that they used to call] the Prophet of God [a liar], or yakdhibn to imply their [mendacity when] saying \u0060we believe\u0027).",
  "When it is said to them, that is, these latter, \u0060Do not spread corruption in the land\u0027, through unbelief and hindering [people from] faith, They say, \u0060We are only putting things right\u0027, that is, \u0060we are not engaging in corruption\u0027. God, exalted be He, refutes them, saying:",
  "Truly (a-l, \u0060truly\u0027, is for alerting), intended emphatically, they are the agents of corruption, but they perceive, this, not.",
  "When it is said to them, \u0060Believe as the people believe\u0027, that is, as the Companions of the Prophet (s), They say, \u0060Shall we believe as fools believe?\u0027, that is, as the ignorant do? No we do not follow their way. The exalted One refutes them, saying: Truly, they are the foolish ones, but they know, this, not.",
  "When they meet (laq is actually laquy, but the damma has been omitted, being too cumbersome for pronunciation; likewise the y\u0027 [is omitted], because it is unvocalised and is followed by a ww); those who believe, they say, \u0060We believe\u0027; but when they go apart, away from them and return, to their devils, their leaders, they say, \u0060We are with you, in religion; we were only mocking, them [the believers] by feigning belief.",
  "God [Himself] mocks them, requiting them for their mockery, leaving them, that is, giving them respite, in their insolence, that is, in their transgressing the limits of unbelief; bewildered, wavering, in perplexity (ya\u0060mahn is a circumstantial qualifier).",
  "Those are they who have bought error for guidance, that is, they have exchanged the latter for the former; so their commerce has not profited them, that is to say, they have gained nothing from it, indeed, they have lost, because their destination is the Fire, made everlasting for them; nor are they guided, in what they did.",
  "Their likeness, the way they are in their hypocrisy, is as the likeness of one who kindled, that is, [one who] lit a fire in darkness, and when it illumined all about him, so that he is able to see, and to feel warm and secure from those he feared, God took away their light, extinguishing it (the plural pronoun [in nrihim] takes into account the [plural] import of alladh); and left them in darkness, unable to see, what is around them, confused as to the way, in fear; likewise are those who have found [temporary] security by professing faith, but who will meet with terror and punishment upon death; these [last] are:",
  "deaf, to the truth, so that they cannot hear it and accept it; dumb, mute as regards goodness, unable to speak of it; and, blind, to the path of guidance, so that they cannot perceive it; they shall not return, from error.",
  "Or, the likeness of them is as a cloudburst, that is, [the likeness of them is] as people are during rain (ka- sayyib: the term is originally sayyb, from [the verb] sba, yasbu, meaning \u0060it came down\u0027); out of the heaven, out of the clouds, in which clouds is darkness, layer upon layer, and thunder, the angel in charge of them [sc. the clouds]; it is also said that this [thunder] is actually the sound of his voice; and lightning, the flash caused by his voice which he uses to drive them -- they, the people under the rain, put their fingers, that is, their fingertips, in their ears against, because of, the thunderclaps, the violent sound of thunder, in order not to hear it, cautious of, fearful of, death, if they were to hear it. Similar is the case with these: when the Qur\u0027n is revealed, in which there is mention of the unbelief that is like darkness, the threat of punishment that is like the sound of thunder, and the clear arguments that are like the clear lightning, they shut their ears in order not to hear it and thereby incline towards [true] faith and abandon their religion, which for them would be death; and God encompasses the disbelievers in both knowledge and power, so they cannot escape Him.",
  "The lightning well-nigh, almost, snatches away their sight, that is, takes it away swiftly; whensoever it gives them light, they walk in it, in its light; and when the darkness is over them, they stop, that is, they stand still: a simile of the perturbation that the Qur\u0027nic arguments cause in their hearts, and of their acknowledging the truths of what they love to hear and recoiling from what they detest; had God willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight, that is, the exterior faculty, in the same way that He took away their inner one; Truly, God has power over all things, [that] He wills, as for example, His taking away of the above-mentioned.",
  "O people, of Mecca, worship, profess the oneness of, your Lord Who created you, made you when you were nothing, and created those that were before you; so that you may be fearful, of His punishment by worshipping Him (la\u0060alla, \u0060so that\u0027, is essentially an optative, but when spoken by God it denotes an affirmative),",
  "He Who assigned to you, created [for you], the earth for a couch, like a carpet that is laid out, neither extremely hard, nor extremely soft so as to make it impossible to stand firm upon it; and heaven for an edifice, like a roof; and sent down from the heaven water, wherewith He brought forth, all types of, fruits for your provision; so set not up compeers to God, that is partners in worship, while you know that He is the Creator, that you create not and that only One that creates can be God.",
  "And if you are in doubt, in uncertainty, concerning what We have revealed to Our servant, Muhammad (s), of the Qur\u0027n, that it is from God, then bring a sra like it, that is also revealed (min mithlihi: min is explicative, that is, a sra like it in its eloquence, fine arrangement and its bestowal of knowledge of the Unseen; a sra is a passage with a beginning and end made up of a minimum of three verses); and call your witnesses, those other gods that you worship, besides God, that is, other than Him, so that it can be seen, if you are truthful, in [your claim] that Muhammad (s) speaks it from himself. So do this, for you are also fluent speakers of Arabic like him. When they could not do this, God said:",
  "And if you do not, do what was mentioned because you are incapable, and you will not (a parenthetical statement), that is, never [will you be able to], because of its inimitability, then fear, through belief in God and [belief] that this is not the words of a human, the Fire, whose fuel is men, disbelievers, and stones, like their very idols, indicating that its heat is extreme, since it burns with the [stones] mentioned, unlike the fires of this world that burn with wood and similar materials; prepared, and made ready, for disbelievers, so that they are punished in it (this [phrase, u\u0060iddat li\u0027l-kfirna, \u0060prepared for disbelievers\u0027] is either a new sentence or a sustained circumstantial qualifier).",
  "And give good tidings to, inform, those who believe, who have faith in God, and perform righteous deeds, such as the obligatory and supererogatory [rituals], that theirs shall be Gardens, of trees, and habitations, underneath which, that is, underneath these trees and palaces, rivers run (tajr min tahtih\u0027l-anhru), that is, there are waters in it (al-nahr is the place in which water flows [and is so called] because the water carves [yanhar] its way through it; the reference to it as \u0060running\u0027 is figurative); whensoever they are provided with fruits therefrom, that is, whenever they are given to eat from these gardens, they shall say, \u0060This is what, that is, the like of what we were provided with before\u0027, that is, before this, in Paradise, since its fruits are similar (and this is evidenced by [the following statement]): they shall be given it, the provision, in perfect semblance, that is, resembling one another in colour, but different in taste; and there for them shall be spouses, of houris and others, purified, from menstruation and impurities; therein they shall abide: dwelling therein forever, neither perishing nor departing therefrom. And when the Jews said, \u0060Why does God strike a similitude about flies, where He says, And if a fly should rob them of anything [Q. 22:73] and about a spider, where He says, As the likeness of the spider [Q. 29:41]: what does God want with these vile creatures? God then revealed the following:",
  "God is not ashamed to strike, to make, a similitude (mathal: is the first direct object; m either represents an indefinite noun described by what comes after it and constitutes a second direct object, meaning \u0060whatever that similitude may be\u0027; or it [the m] is extra to emphasise the vileness [involved], so that what follows constitutes the second direct object); even of a gnat, (ba\u0060da is the singular of ba\u0060d), that is, small flies; or anything above it, that is, larger than it, so that this explanation is not affected [by the size of the creature] with regard to the judgement [God is making]; as for the believers, they know it, the similitude, is the truth, established and given in this instance, from their Lord; but as for disbelievers, they say, \u0060What did God desire by this for a similitude?\u0027 (mathalan is a specification, meaning, \u0060by this similitude\u0027; m is an interrogative of rejection and is the subject; dh means alladh, whose relative clause contains its predicate, in other words, \u0060what use is there in it?\u0027). God then responds to them saying: Thereby, that is, by this similitude, He leads many astray, from the truth on account of their disbelieving in it, and thereby He guides many, believers on account of their belief in it; and thereby He leads none astray except the wicked, those that reject obedience to Him.",
  "Those such as, He has described, break the covenant of God, the contract He made with them in the [revealed] Books to belief in Muhammad (s), after its solemn binding, after it has been confirmed with them, and such as cut what God has commanded should be joined, of belief in the Prophet, of kinship and other matters (an [in the phrase an ysala, \u0060that it be joined\u0027] substitutes for the pronoun [suffixed] in bihi [of the preceding words m amara Llhu bihi, \u0060that which God has commanded\u0027]); and such as do corruption in the land, by way of their transgressing and impeding faith, they, the ones thus described, shall be the losers, since, they shall end up in the Fire, made everlasting for them.",
  "How do you, people of Mecca, disbelieve in God, when you were dead, semen inside loins, and He gave you life, in the womb and in this world by breathing Spirit into you (the interrogative here is either intended to provoke amazement at their [persistent] unbelief despite the evidence established, or intended as a rebuke); then He shall make you dead, after your terms of life are completed, then He shall give you life, at the Resurrection, then to Him you shall be returned!, after resurrection, whereupon He shall requite you according to your deeds; and He states, as proof of the Resurrection, when they denied it:",
  "He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth, that is, the earth and all that is in it, so that you may benefit from and learn lessons from it; then, after creating the earth, He turned to, that is, He made His object, heaven and levelled them (fa-sawwhunna: the pronoun [-hunna] refers to \u0060heaven\u0027, since, it [heaven] is implicit in the import of the sentence attributed to it [the pronoun]), that is to say, He made them thus, as [He says] in another verse, [fa-qadhunna] so He determined them [Q. 41:12]) seven heavens and He has knowledge of all things, in their totality and in their individual detail, so do you not then think that the One who has the power to create this to begin with, which is much greater than what you are, also has the power to bring you back [after death]?",
  "And, mention, O Muhammad (s), when your Lord said to the angels, \u0060I am appointing on earth a vicegerent\u0027, who shall act as My deputy, by implementing My rulings therein -- and this [vicegerent] was Adam; They said, \u0060What, will You appoint therein one who will do corruption therein, through disobedience, and shed blood, spilling it through killing, just as the progeny of the jinn did, for they used to inhabit it, but when they became corrupted God sent down the angels against them and they were driven away to islands and into the mountains; while we glorify, continuously, You with praise, that is, \u0022We say Glory and Praise be to You\u0022, and sanctify You?\u0027, that is, \u0060We exalt You as transcendent above what does not befit You?; the lm [of laka, \u0060You\u0027] is extra, and the sentence [wa-nuqaddisu laka, \u0060We sanctify You\u0027] is a circumstantial qualifier, the import being, \u0060thus, we are more entitled to be Your vicegerents\u0027); He, exalted be He, said, \u0060Assuredly, I know what you know not\u0027, of the benefits of making Adam a vicegerent and of the fact that among his progeny will be the obedient and the transgressor, and justice will prevail between them. They said, \u0060God will never create anything more noble in His eyes than us nor more knowledgeable, since we have been created before it and have seen what it has not seen. God then created Adam from the surface of the earth (adm al-ard [adm literally means \u0060skin\u0027]), taking a handful of all its colours and mixing it with different waters, then made him upright and breathed into him the Spirit and he thus became a living being with senses, after having been inanimate.",
  "And He taught Adam the names, that is, the names of things named, all of them, by placing knowledge of them into his heart; then He presented them, these names, the majority of which concerned intellectual beings, to the angels and said, to them in reproach, \u0060Now tell Me, inform Me, the names of these, things named, if you speak truly\u0027, in your claim that I would not create anything more knowledgeable than you, or that you are more deserving of this vicegerency; the response to the conditional sentence is intimated by what precedes it.",
  "They said, \u0060Glory be to You!, exalting You above that any should object to You, We know not except what You have taught us. Surely You are (innaka anta emphasises the [preceding suffixed pronoun] kf) the Knower, Wise\u0027, from whose knowledge and wisdom nothing escapes.",
  "He, exalted be He, said, \u0060Adam, tell them, the angels, their names\u0027, all of the things named; so, he named each thing by its appellation and mentioned the wisdom behind its creation; And when he had told them their names He, exalted, said, in rebuke, \u0060Did I not tell you that I know the Unseen in the heavens and the earth?, what is unseen in them, And I know what you reveal, what you manifested when you said, \u0060What, will You appoint therein ...\u0027, and what you were hiding, what you were keeping secret when you were saying that God would not create anything more knowledgeable or more noble in His eyes than us.",
  "And, mention, when We said to the angels, \u0060Prostrate yourselves to Adam\u0027, a prostration that is a bow of salutation; so they prostrated themselves, except Ibls, the father of the jinn, who was among the angels, he refused, to prostrate, and disdained, became proud and said, I am better than he [Q. 7:12]; and so he became one of the disbelievers, according to God\u0027s knowledge.",
  "And We said, \u0060Adam, dwell (anta, \u0060you\u0027 [of \u0060dwell you\u0027] here reiterates the concealed pronoun [of the person of the verb uskun], so that it [wa-zawjuk] may be made a supplement to it); and your wife, Eve (Haww\u0027) -- who was created from his left rib -- in the Garden, and eat thereof, of its food, easefully, of anything without restrictions, where you desire; but do not come near this tree, to eat from it, and this was wheat or a vine or something else, lest you be, become, evildoers\u0027, that is, transgressors.",
  "Then Satan, Ibls, caused them to slip, he caused them to be removed (fa-azallahum: a variant reading has fa-azlahum: he caused them to be away from it) therefrom, that is, from the Garden, when he said to them, \u0060Shall I point you to the tree of eternity\u0027 [cf. Q. 20:120], and swore to them by God that he was only giving good advice to them, and so they ate of it; and brought them out of what they were in, of bliss; and We said, \u0060Go down, to earth, both of you and all those comprised by your seed; some of you, of your progeny, an enemy to the other, through your wronging one another; and in the earth a dwelling, a place of settlement, shall be yours, and enjoyment, of whatever of its vegetation you may enjoy, for a while\u0027, [until] the time your terms [of life] are concluded.",
  "Thereafter Adam received certain words from his Lord, with which He inspired him (a variant reading [of damu] has accusative dama and nominative kalimtu), meaning they [the words] came to him, and these were [those of] the verse Lord, we have wronged ourselves [Q. 7:23], with which he supplicated, and He relented to him, that is, He accepted his repentance; truly He is the Relenting, to His servants, the Merciful, to them.",
  "We said, \u0060Go down from it, from the Garden, all together (He has repeated this [phrase quln ihbit] in order to supplement it with), yet (fa-imm: the nn of the conditional particle in [\u0060if\u0027] has been assimilated with the extra m) there shall come to you from Me guidance, a Book and a prophet, and whoever follows My guidance, believing in me and performing deeds in obedience of Me, no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve, in the Hereafter, since they will be admitted into Paradise.",
  "As for the disbelievers who deny Our signs, Our Books, those shall be the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding therein\u0027, enduring perpetually, neither perishing nor exiting therefrom.",
  "O Children of Israel, sons of Jacob, remember My favour wherewith I favoured you, that is, your forefathers, saving them from Pharaoh, parting the sea, sending clouds as shelter and other instances, for which you should show gratitude by being obedient to Me; and fulfil My covenant, that which I took from you, that you believe in Muhammad (s), and I shall fulfil your covenant, that which I gave to you, that you shall be rewarded for this with Paradise; and be in awe of Me, fear Me and not anyone else when you have abandoned belief in him [the Prophet].",
  "And believe in what I have revealed, of the Qur\u0027n, confirming that which is with you, of the Torah, by its agreement with it, in respect to [affirmation of] God\u0027s Oneness and prophethood; and be not the first to disbelieve in it, from among the People of the Scripture, for those who will come after you will depend on you and so you will bear their sins. And do not sell, exchange, My signs, those that relate to the description of Muhammad (s) in your Book; for a small price, for a trivial and temporary affair of this world; that is to say, do not suppress this for fear of losing what you hope to earn from lowly individuals among you; and fear Me, and none other in this matter.",
  "And do not obscure, confuse, the truth, that I have revealed to you, with falsehood, that you fabricate; and do not conceal the truth, the description of Muhammad (s), wittingly, that is, knowing it to be the truth.",
  "And establish prayer, and pay the alms, and bow with those that bow, that is, pray with those who pray, Muhammad (s) and his Companions: this was revealed concerning their religious scholars, who used to say to their kin from among the Muslims, \u0060Stay firm upon the religion of Muhammad (s), for it is the truth\u0027.",
  "Will you bid others to piety, to belief in Muhammad (s), and forget yourselves, neglecting yourselves and not bidding them to the same, while you recite the Book?, in which there is the threat of chastisement, if what you do contradicts what you say. Do you not understand? the evil nature of your actions, that you might then repent? (the sentence about \u0060forgetting\u0027 constitutes the [syntactical] locus of the interrogative of disavowal).",
  "Seek help, ask for assistance in your affairs, in patience, by restraining the soul in the face of that which it dislikes; and prayer. The singling out of this for mention is a way of emphasising its great importance; in one hadth, [it is stated], \u0060When something bothered the Prophet (s), he would immediately resort to prayer\u0027; it is said that the address here is to the Jews: when greed and desire for leadership became impediments to their faith, they were enjoined to forbearance, which constituted fasting and prayer, since, the former stems from lust and the latter yields humility and negates pride. For it, prayer, is grievous, burdensome, except to the humble, those that are at peace in obedience,",
  "who reckon, who are certain, that they shall meet their Lord, at the Resurrection, and that to Him they are returning, in the Hereafter, where He will reward them.",
  "O Children of Israel, remember My favour wherewith I favoured you, by giving thanks through obedience to Me, and that I have preferred you, your forefathers, above all the worlds, of their time;",
  "and fear, be scared of, the day when no soul for another shall give satisfaction, which is the Day of Resurrection, and no intercession shall be accepted (read either tuqbal or yuqbal) from it, that is, it is not the case that it has power to intercede, for it then to be accepted from it [or rejected, as God says], So now we have no intercessors [Q. 26:100]; nor any compensation, ransom, be taken, neither shall they be helped, to avoid God\u0027s chastisement.",
  "And, remember, when We delivered you, your forefathers: the address here and henceforth directed to those living at the time of the our Prophet, is about how God blessed their forefathers, and is intended to remind them of God\u0027s grace so that they might believe; from the folk of Pharaoh who were visiting you with, that is, making you taste, evil chastisement, of the worst kind (the sentence here is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the pronoun [suffixed] in najjaynkum, \u0060We delivered you\u0027); slaughtering your, newly-born, sons: this is explaining what has just been said; and sparing, retaining, your women, [doing so] because of the saying of some of their priests that a child born among the Israelites shall bring about the end of your rule [Pharaoh]; and for you therein, chastisement or deliverance, was a tremendous trial, a test or a grace, from your Lord.",
  "And, remember, when We divided, split in two, for you, on account of you, the sea, such that you were able to cross it and escape from your enemy; and We delivered you, from drowning, and drowned Pharaoh\u0027s folk, his people with him, while you were beholding the sea crashing down on top of them.",
  "And when We appointed for (w\u0060adn or wa\u0060adn) Moses forty nights, at the end of which We shall give him the Torah for you to implement, then you took to yourselves the calf, the one which the Samaritan fashioned for you as a god, after him, that is, after he departed for Our appointment, and you were evildoers, for taking it [in worship], because you directed your worship to the wrong place.",
  "Then We pardoned you, erasing your sins, after that, act of worship, so that you might be thankful, for Our favour upon you.",
  "And when We gave to Moses the Scripture, the Torah, and the Criterion (wa\u0027l-furqn is an explicative supplement [of Torah]), that is, the one that discriminates (faraqa) between truth and falsehood and between what is licit and illicit, so that you might be guided, by it away from error.",
  "And when Moses said to his people, those who worshipped the calf, \u0060My people, you have done wrong against yourselves by your taking the [golden] calf, for a god; now turn to your Creator, away from that worship [of the calf] and slay one another, that is, let the innocent of you slay the guilty; That, slaughter, will be better for you in your Creator\u0027s sight\u0027, who made it easier for you to accomplish this and sent down a dark cloud over you, so that none of you was able to see the other and show him mercy, such that almost seventy thousand of you were killed; and He will turn to you [relenting], before your [turning in] repentance; truly He is the Relenting, the Merciful.",
  "And when you said, having gone out with Moses to apologise before God for your worship of the calf, and having heard what he had said [to you]; \u0060O Moses, we will not believe you till we see God openly\u0027, with our own eyes; and the thunderbolt, the shout, took you, and you died, while you were beholding, what was happening to you.",
  "Then We raised you up, brought you back to life, after you were dead, so that you might be thankful, for this favour of Ours.",
  "And We made the cloud overshadow you, that is, We sheltered you with fine clouds from the heat of the sun while you were in the wilderness; and We sent down, in them [the clouds], upon you manna and quails -- which are [respectively, a type of citrus known as] turunjabn and the quail -- and We said: \u0060Eat of the good things We have provided for you\u0027, and do not store any of it away, but they were not grateful for this favour and stored the food, and so they were deprived of it; And they did not wrong Us, in this, but themselves they wronged, since the evil consequences [of this] befell them.",
  "And when We said, to them, after they came out of the wilderness, \u0060Enter this city, either the Holy House [of Jerusalem] (Bayt al-Maqdis) or Jericho (Arh), and eat freely therein wherever you will, plentifully and without any restrictions, and enter it at the gate, its gate, prostrating, bowing, and say, \u0060our request is for [an] exoneration\u0027, that is, \u0060That we be exonerated from our transgressions\u0027, and We shall forgive (naghfir: a variant reading has one of the two passive forms yughfar or tughfar, \u0060[they] will be forgiven\u0027) you your transgressions and We shall give more to those who are virtuous\u0027 -- through obedience -- in terms of reward.",
  "Then the evildoers, among them, substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them, and said instead, \u0060A grain inside a hair\u0027 and entered [the town] dragging themselves on their rears; so We sent down upon the evildoers (the replacement of the second person [of the previous verse] with the overt identification in the third person alladhna zalam, \u0060the evildoers\u0027, is intended to emphasise the depravity of their action) wrath, a punishment of plague, from the heaven for their wickedness, for deviating from obedience, and within a very short period of time just under seventy thousand of them were dead.",
  "And, mention, when Moses sought water for his people, for they suffered thirst in the wilderness, We said, \u0060Strike with your staff the rock, (the one that ran off with his robe, a light cube-like [rock] about the size of a man\u0027s head, made of marble) and he struck it, and there exploded, there burst and gushed forth, from it twelve fountains, equal to the number of tribes, each people, [each] tribe among them, came to know their drinking-place, which they did not share with any of the others. And We said to them, \u0060Eat and drink of that which God has provided, and do not be degenerate in the earth, seeking corruption\u0027 (mufsidn is a circumstantial qualifier emphasising its operator, the subject of the verb [l ta\u0060thaw, \u0060do not be degenerate\u0027] derived from \u0060athiya, meaning afsada, \u0060to corrupt\u0027).",
  "And when you said, \u0060Moses, we will not endure one sort of food, that is to say, manna and quails; pray to your Lord for us, that He may bring forth for us, something, of (min here is explicative) what the earth produces -- green herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, onions\u0027, he, Moses, said, to them, \u0060Would you exchange what is better, more noble, that is, do you substitute this, with what is lowlier?\u0027 (the hamza of a-tastabdilna is for rebuke); they thus refused to change their mind and he [Moses] supplicated to God, and He, exalted be He, said, \u0060Go down to a city, whichever city it may be; you shall have, there, what you demanded\u0027 of vegetable produce; And abasement, submissiveness, and wretchedness, that is, the signs of poverty on account of their submissiveness and debasement that always accompany them, even if they be rich, in the same way that a coin never changes its mint; were cast upon them, and they incurred, ended up with God\u0027s wrath; that, that is, that affliction and wrath, was because they used to disbelieve the signs of God and slay prophets, such as Zachariah and John, without right, that is, unjustly; that was because they disobeyed, and they were transgressors, overstepping the bounds in disobedience (here the repetition [dhlik bi-m \u0060asaw wa-kn ya\u0060tadn] is for emphasis).",
  "Surely those who believe, [who believed] before, in the prophets, and those of Jewry, the Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabaeans, a Christian or Jewish sect, whoever, from among them, believes in God and the Last Day, in the time of our Prophet, and performs righteous deeds, according to the Law given to him -- their wage, that is, the reward for their deeds, is with their Lord, and no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve (the [singular] person of the verbs mana, \u0060believes\u0027, and \u0060amila, \u0060performs\u0027, takes account of the [singular] form of man, \u0060whoever\u0027, but in what comes afterwards [of the plural pronouns] its [plural] meaning [is taken into account]).",
  "And, mention, when We made a covenant with you, your pledge to act according to what is in the Torah, and We, had, raised above you the Mount, which We uprooted from the earth [and placed] above you when you refused to accept it [sc. the Torah], and We said, \u0060Take forcefully, seriously and with effort, what We have given you, and remember what is in it, acting in accordance with it, so that you might preserve yourselves\u0027, from the Fire or acts of disobedience.",
  "Then you turned away thereafter, and but for God\u0027s bounty and His mercy towards you, you would have been among the losers [there is no commentary on this verse].",
  "And verily (wa-la-qad: the lm is for oaths) you know that there were those among you who transgressed, violated, the Sabbath, by fishing, when We had forbidden you to do so -- these were the inhabitants of Eilat -- and We said to them, \u0060Be apes, despised!\u0027, rejected, and they became so: they died three days later.",
  "And We made it, this punishment, an exemplary punishment, a lesson to dissuade others from doing what they did; for all the former times and for the latter, that is, for the people of that time or those that came later; and an admonition to such as who fear, God: these are singled out for mention here because they, in contrast to others, are the ones who benefit thereby.",
  "And, mention, when Moses said to his people, when one among them was killed and the killer was not known, and so they asked Moses to pray to God to reveal the killer, which he did; \u0060God commands you to sacrifice a cow\u0027. They said, \u0060Do you take us in mockery?\u0027, that is, making fun of us when you answer us like this? He said, \u0060I take refuge with, I seek defence with, God lest I should be one of the ignorant\u0027, one of those who indulge in mockery.",
  "But when they realised that he was being serious, They said, \u0060Pray to your Lord for us, that He may make clear to us what she may be\u0027, its true nature, He, Moses, said, \u0060He, God, says she is a cow neither old, nor virgin, that is, young, middling between the two, in terms of age; so do what you have been commanded\u0027, by way of sacrificing it.",
  "They said, \u0060Pray to your Lord for us, that He make clear to us what her colour may be\u0027 He said, \u0060He says she shall be a golden cow, bright in colour, that is, of a very intense yellow, gladdening to beholders: its beauty will please those that look at it.",
  "They said, \u0060Pray to your Lord for us, that He make clear to us what she may be: does it graze freely or is it used in labour?; the cows (that is, the species described in the way mentioned), are all alike to us, because there are many of them and we have not been able to find the one sought after; and if God wills, we shall then be guided\u0027 to it. In one hadth [it is reported]: \u0060Had they not uttered the proviso [insh\u0027a Llh], it would never have been made clear to them\u0027.",
  "He said, \u0060He says she shall be a cow not broken, not subdued for labour, that is, to plough the earth, churning its soil for sowing (tuthr al-ard: the clause describes the word dhall, and constitutes part of the negation); or to water the tillage, that is, the land prepared for sowing; one safe, from faults and the effects of toil; with no blemish, of a colour other than her own, on her\u0027. They said, \u0060Now you have brought the truth\u0027, that is, [now] you have explained it clearly; they thus sought it out and found it with a boy very dutiful towards his mother, and they eventually purchased it for the equivalent of its weight in gold; and so they sacrificed her, even though they very nearly did not, on account of its excessive cost. In a hadth [it is stated that], \u0060Had they sacrificed any cow, it would have sufficed them, but they made it difficult for themselves and so God made it difficult for them\u0027.",
  "And when you killed a living soul, and disputed thereon (iddra\u0027tum: the t\u0027 [of the root-form itdra\u0027tum] has been assimilated with the dl) -- and God disclosed what you were hiding (this is a parenthetical statement; the story begins here [with wa-idh qataltum nafsan, \u0060and when you killed a soul\u0027... and continues in the following]):",
  "so We said, \u0060Smite him, the slain man, with part of it\u0027, and so when he was struck with its tongue or its tail, he came back to life and said, \u0060So-and-so killed me\u0027, and after pointing out two of his cousins, he died; the two [killers] were denied the inheritance and were later killed. God says: even so, is the revival, for, God brings to life the dead, and He shows you His signs, the proofs of His power, so that you might understand, [that you might] reflect and realise that the One capable of reviving a single soul is also capable of reviving a multitude of souls, and then believe.",
  "Then your hearts became hardened, O you Jews, they [your hearts] became stiffened against acceptance of the truth, thereafter, that is, after what is mentioned of the bringing back to life of the slain man and the other signs before this; and they are like stones, in their hardness, or even yet harder, than these; for there are stones from which rivers come gushing, and others split (yashshaqqaq: the initial t\u0027 [of the root-form yatashaqqaq] has been assimilated with the shn), so that water issues from them; and others come down, from on high, in fear of God, while your hearts are unmoved, unstirred and not humbled; And God is not heedless of what you do, but instead, He gives you respite until your time comes (ta\u0060malna, \u0060you do\u0027: a variant reading has ya\u0060malna, \u0060they do\u0027, indicating a shift to the third person address).",
  "Are you then so eager, O believers, that they, the Jews, should believe you, seeing there is a party of them, a group of their rabbis, that heard God\u0027s word, in the Torah, and then tampered with it, changing it, and that, after they had comprehended it, [after] they had understood it, knowingly?, [knowing full well] that they were indulging in mendacity (the hamza [at the beginning of the verb a-fa-tatma\u0060n] is [an interrogative] for rejection, in other words, \u0060Do not be so eager, for they have disbelieved before\u0027).",
  "And when they, the hypocrites from among the Jews, meet those who believe, they say, \u0060We believe\u0027, that Muhammad (s) is a prophet and that he is the one of whom we have been given good tidings in our Book; but when they go in private one to another, they, their leaders the ones not involved in the hypocrisy, say, to those hypocrites: \u0060Do you speak to them, the believers, of what God has disclosed to you, that is, what He has made known to you of Muhammad\u0027s (s) description in the Torah, so that they may thereby dispute (the lm of li-yuhjjkum, \u0060that they may dispute with you\u0027, is the lm of \u0060becoming\u0027) with you before your Lord?, in the Hereafter and hold the proof against you for not following him [Muhammad (s)], despite your knowledge of his sincerity? Have you no understanding?\u0027 of the fact that they will contend with you if you speak to them in this way? So beware.",
  "God says: Know they not (the interrogative is affirmative, the inserted ww [of a-wa-l] is to indicate the supplement) that God knows what they keep secret and what they proclaim?, that is, what they hide and what they reveal in this matter and all other matters, so that they may desist from these things.",
  "And there are some of them, the Jews, that are illiterate, unlettered, not knowing the Scripture, the Torah, but only desires, lies which were handed down to them by their leaders and which they relied upon; and, in their rejection of the prophethood of the Prophet and fabrications of other matters, they have, mere conjectures, and no firm knowledge.",
  "So woe, a severe chastisement, to those who write the Scripture with their hands, that is, fabricating it themselves, then say, \u0060This is from God\u0027 that they may sell it for a small price, of this world: these are the Jews, the ones that altered the description of the Prophet in the Torah, as well as the \u0060stoning\u0027 verse, and other details, and rewrote them in a way different from that in which they were revealed. So woe to them for what their hands have written, of fabrications, and woe to them for their earnings, by way of bribery (rishan, plural of rishwa).",
  "And they say, when the Prophet promised them the Fire, \u0060the Fire shall not touch us, that is, afflict us, save a number of days\u0027, only a short time of forty days: the same length of time their forefathers worshipped the calf, after which time it [the Fire] will cease. Say, to them Muhammad (s): \u0060Have you taken with God a covenant?, a pledge from Him to this? God will not fail in His covenant, in this matter, or -- nay -- say you against God what you do not know? (a\u0027ttakhadhtum: the conjunctive hamza has been omitted on account of the interrogative hamza sufficing).",
  "Not so, it will touch you and you will abide therein; whoever earns evil, through associating another with God, and is encompassed by his transgression, in the singular and the plural, that is to say, it overcomes him and encircles him totally, for, he has died an idolater -- those are the inhabitants of the Fire, therein abiding (khlidn: this [plural noun] takes account of the [plural] import of man, \u0060whoever\u0027).",
  "And those who believe and perform righteous deeds -- those are the inhabitants of Paradise, therein abiding.",
  "And, mention, when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, in the Torah, where We said: \u0060You shall not worship (a variant reading [for l ta\u0060budna] has [third person plural] l ya\u0060budn [\u0060they shall not worship\u0027]) any other than God (l ta\u0060budna ill Llha is a predicate denoting a prohibition; one may also read l ta\u0060bud [Worship you not]); and to be good, and righteous, to parents, and the near of kin: here kinship is adjoined to parents; and to orphans, and to the needy; and speak well, [good] words, to men, commanding good and forbidding evil, being truthful with regard to the status of Muhammad (s), and being kind to them [sc. orphans and the needy] (a variant reading [for hasanan] has husnan, the verbal noun, used as a hyperbolic description); and observe prayer and pay the alms\u0027, which you actually accepted, but, then you turned away, refusing to fulfil these [obligations] (here the second person address is used, but their forefathers are [still] meant); all but a few of you, rejecting it, like your forefathers.",
  "And when We made a covenant with you, and We said: \u0060You shall not shed your own blood, spilling it by slaying one another; neither expel your own from your habitations\u0027: let no one of you expel the other from his house; then you confirmed it, that is, you accepted this covenant, and you bore witness, upon your own souls.",
  "Then there you are killing one another, and expelling a party of you from their habitations, conspiring (tazzharna: the original ta\u0027 has been assimilated with the z\u0027; a variant reading has it without [the assimilation, that is, tazharna]), assisting one another, against them in sin, in disobedience, and enmity, injustice, and if they come to you as captives (a variant reading [for usr] has asr), you ransom them (a variant reading [for tafdhum] has tufdhum), that is to say, you deliver them from captivity with money etc., and this [ransoming] was one of the things to which they were pledged; yet their expulsion was forbidden you (muharramun \u0060alaykum ikhrjuhum is semantically connected to wa-tukhrijna, \u0060and expelling\u0027, and the statement that comes in between is parenthetical, that is, [expulsion was forbidden you] in the same way that non-ransoming was forbidden you). Qurayza had allied themselves with the Aws, and the Nadr with the Khazraj, but every member of an alliance would fight against a fellow ally, thus destroying each other\u0027s homes and expelling one another, taking prisoners and then ransoming them. When they were asked: \u0060Why do you fight them and then pay their ransom?\u0027, they would reply, \u0060Because we have been commanded to ransom\u0027; and they would be asked, \u0060So, why do you fight them then?\u0027, to which they would say, \u0060For fear that our allies be humiliated\u0027; God, exalted, says: What, do you believe in part of the Book, that is, the part about ransom, and disbelieve in part?, namely, the part about renouncing fighting, expulsion and assistance [against one another]; What shall be the requital of those of you who do that, but degradation, disgrace and ignominy, in the life of this world: they were disgraced when Qurayza were slewn and the Nadr were expelled to Syria, and ordered to pay the jizya; and on the Day of Resurrection to be returned to the most terrible of chastisement? And God is not heedless of what you do (ta\u0060malna, or read ya\u0060malna, \u0060they do\u0027).",
  "Those are the ones who have purchased the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter, by preferring the former to the latter -- for them the punishment shall not be lightened, neither shall they be helped, [neither shall they be] protected against it.",
  "And We gave Moses the Scripture, the Torah, and after him We sent successive messengers, that is, We sent them one after another, and We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs, that is, the miracles of bringing the dead back to life and healing the blind and the leper, and We confirmed him, We strengthened him, with the Holy Spirit (the expression rh al-qudus is an example of annexing [in a genitive construction] the noun described to the adjective [qualifying it], in other words, al-rh al-muqaddasa), that is, Gabriel, [so described] on account of his [Jesus\u0027s] sanctity; he would accompany him [Jesus] wherever he went; still you refuse to be upright, and whenever there came to you a messenger, with what your souls did not desire, [did not] like, in the way of truth, you became arrogant, you disdained to follow him (istakbartum, \u0060you became arrogant\u0027, is the response to the particle kullam, \u0060whenever\u0027, and constitutes the interrogative, and is meant as a rebuke); and some, of them, you called liars, such as Jesus, and some you slay?, such as Zachariah and John (the present tenses [of these verbs] are used to narrate the past events [as though they were events in the present], in other words, \u0060[and some] you slew\u0027).",
  "And they say, to the Prophet mockingly: \u0060Our hearts are encased\u0027 (ghulf is the plural of aghlaf), that is to say, wrapped up in covers and cannot comprehend what you say; God, exalted be He, says: Nay (bal introduces the rebuttal), but God has cursed them, removed them far from His mercy and degraded them when they rejected [the messengers], for their unbelief, which is not the result of anything defective in their hearts; and little will they believe (fa-qallan m yu\u0027minn: the m here is extra, emphasising the \u0060littleness\u0027 involved): that is, their belief is minimal.",
  "When there came to them a Book from God, confirming what was with them, in the Torah, that is the Qur\u0027n -- and they formerly, before it came, prayed for victory, for assistance, over the disbelievers, saying: \u0060God, give us assistance against them through the Prophet that shall be sent at the end of time\u0027; but when there came to them what they recognised, as the truth, that is, the mission of the Prophet, they disbelieved in it, out of envy and for fear of losing leadership (the response to the first lamm particle is indicated by the response to the second one); and the curse of God is on the disbelievers.",
  "Evil is that for which they sell their souls, that is, their share of the reward [in the Hereafter] (bi\u0027sam, \u0060evil is that [for] which\u0027: m here is an indefinite particle, representing \u0060a thing\u0027, and constitutes a specification qualifying the subject of [the verb] bi\u0027s, \u0060evil is\u0027, the very thing being singled out for criticism); that they disbelieve in that, Qur\u0027n, which God has revealed, grudging (baghyan here is an object denoting reason for yakfur, \u0060they disbelieve\u0027), that is, out of envy, that God should reveal (read either yunzil or yunazzil) of His bounty, the Inspiration, to whomever He will of His servants, to deliver the Message; and they were laden, they returned, with anger, from God for their disbelief in what He has revealed (the indefinite form, bi- ghadabin, \u0060with anger\u0027, is used to emphasise the awesomeness [of the \u0060anger\u0027]), upon anger, which they deserved formerly, when they neglected the Torah and disbelieved in Jesus; and for the disbelievers there shall be a humiliating chastisement.",
  "And when it was said to them, \u0060Believe in what God has revealed, that is, the Qur\u0027n and other [Books], they said, \u0060We believe in what was revealed to us\u0027, that is, the Torah; and (w, here indicates a circumstantial qualifier) they disbelieve in what is beyond that, what is other than that or what came afterwards, such as the Qur\u0027n; yet it is the truth (wa-huwa\u0027l-haqqu is a circumstantial qualifier) confirming (musaddiqan, a second circumstantial qualifier for emphasis) what is with them. Say, to them: \u0060Why then were you slaying the prophets of God formerly, if you were believers?\u0027 in the Torah and in it you were forbidden to kill them: this address, concerning what their forefathers did, is directed towards those present at the time of our Prophet, on account of their approval of it [that is, of what the forefathers had done].",
  "And Moses came to you with clear proofs, miracles, such as the staff, his hand, and the parting of the sea; then you took to yourselves the calf, as a god, after him, after he had gone to the appointment, and you were evildoers, for taking it [in worship].",
  "And when We made a covenant with you, to act according to what is in the Torah, and raised over you the Mount, to drop it on you, when you had refused to accept it; We said, \u0060Take forcefully, seriously and with effort, what We have given you, and listen\u0027, to what you have been commanded, and be prepared to accept it, They said, \u0060We hear, your words, and disobey\u0027, your command; and they were made to drink the calf in their hearts, that is to say, the love of it [the golden calf] intoxicated their hearts in the way that wine does, on account of their unbelief. Say, to them: \u0060Evil is that, thing, which your belief, in the Torah, enjoins on you, [in the way of] the worship of the [golden] calf, if you are believers\u0027, in it, as you claim; meaning, you are not believers, for faith does not command that you worship the calf -- their forefathers are meant here. Likewise, you do not believe in the Torah, because you have denied [the prophethood of] Muhammad (s), whereas faith in it does not command you to reject him.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060If the Abode of the Hereafter, that is, Paradise, with God is purely yours, that is, exclusively, and not for other people, as you allege, then long for death -- if you speak truly\u0027 (here both conditionals are connected to the verb tamann, \u0060long for\u0027, so that the first is dependent upon the second, in other words, \u0060If you speak truly when you claim that it is yours, then you will naturally incline to what is yours, and since the path to it is death, long for it [death]\u0027).",
  "But they will never long for it, because of that which their own hands have sent before them, as a result of their rejection of the Prophet (s), the consequence of their mendacity. God knows the evildoers, the disbelievers and He will requite them.",
  "And you shall find them (the lm of la-tajidannahum is for oaths) the people most covetous of life, and, more covetous of it than, the idolaters, who reject the [idea of the] Resurrection, for the former know that their journey\u0027s end will be the Fire, while the idolaters do not believe even in this; any one of them would love, wishes, that he might be given life for a thousand years (law yu\u0060ammar, \u0060[if only] he might be given life\u0027: the particle law, \u0060if only\u0027, relates to the verbal noun and functions with the sense of an, \u0060that\u0027, and together with its relative clause explains the [implicit] verbal noun in the object of the verb yawaddu, \u0060he would love\u0027); yet, any one of them, his being given life (an yu\u0060ammara, \u0060that he should be given life\u0027, constitutes the subject of the verb muzahzihihi, \u0060that it should budge him\u0027 [this verb comes later], as though it were ta\u0060mruhu, \u0060the giving of life to him\u0027) shall not budge, remove, him from the chastisement, of the Fire. God sees what they do (ya\u0060malna may be alternatively read ta\u0060malna, \u0060you do\u0027), and will requite them. [\u0060Abd Allh] Ibn Sry asked the Prophet (s), or \u0060Umar [b. al-Khattb], about which angel brings down the revelation, and he replied that it was Gabriel; he [Ibn Sry] then said, \u0060He is our enemy, because he brings chastisement with him; had it been Michael, we would have believed in him, because he brings fertility and security.\u0027 Then, the following was revealed:",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel, let him die in exasperation -- he it was that brought it, the Qur\u0027n, down upon your heart by the leave, by the command, of God, confirming what was before it, of scriptures, a guidance, from error, and good tidings, of Paradise, for the believers.",
  "Whoever is an enemy to God and His angels and His messengers, and Gabriel (read Jibrl or Jabrl, Jibra\u0027il or Jabra\u0027il, Jibra\u0027l or Jabra\u0027l), and Michael (Mkl, also read Mk\u0027l, or Mk\u0027il; a supplement to mal\u0027ikatihi, \u0060His angels\u0027, an example of the specific being supplemented to the collective) -- then surely God is an enemy to the disbelievers\u0027 (He says \u0060to the disbelievers\u0027 instead of \u0060to them\u0027 in order to point out their status).",
  "And We have revealed to you, O Muhammad (s), clear proofs, lucid [ones] (bayyintin, \u0060clear proofs\u0027, is a circumstantial qualifier; this was in response to Ibn Sry saying to the Prophet (s), \u0060You have not brought us anything\u0027); and none disbelieves in them except the wicked, these have disbelieved in them.",
  "Why, whenever they make a covenant, with God that they will believe in the Prophet (s) when he appears, or that they will not give assistance to the idolaters against the Prophet (s), does a party of them reject it?, cast it away repudiating it (this is the response to the clause beginning with kullam, the interrogative of rebuke). Nay (bal indicates a transition), but most of them are disbelievers.",
  "When there came to them a messenger from God, namely, Muhammad (s), confirming what was with them, a party of them who were given the Scripture have cast away the Scripture of God, that is, the Torah, behind their backs, that is to say, they have not acted according to what it said about belief in the Messenger and otherwise; as though they did not know, what is contained in it, to the effect that he is a true Prophet, or that it is the Book of God.",
  "And they follow (wa\u0027ttaba\u0060 is a supplement to nabadha, \u0060[it] cast away\u0027) what the devils used to relate, during the time of, Solomon\u0027s kingdom, in the way of sorcery: it is said that they [the devils] buried these [books of sorcery] underneath his throne when his kingdom was taken from him; it is also said that they used to listen stealthily and add fabrications to what they heard, and then pass it on to the priests, who would compile it in books; this would be disseminated and rumours spread that the jinn had knowledge of the Unseen. Solomon gathered these books and buried them. When he died, the devils showed people where these books were, and the latter brought them out and found that they contained sorcery, and said, \u0060Your kingdom was only thanks to what is in here\u0027; they then took to learning them and rejected the Scriptures of their prophets. In order to demonstrate Solomon\u0027s innocence and in repudiation of the Jews when they said, \u0060Look at this Muhammad, he mentions Solomon as one of the prophets, when he was only a sorcerer\u0027, God, exalted, says: Solomon disbelieved not, that is, he did not work magic because he disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching the people sorcery (this sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person governing the verb kafar); and, teaching them, that which was revealed to the two angels, that is, the sorcery that they were inspired to [perform] (al-malakayn, \u0060the two angels\u0027: a variant reading has al-malikayn, \u0060the two kings\u0027) who were, in Babylon -- a town in lower Iraq -- Hrt and Mrt (here the names are standing in for \u0060the two angels\u0027, or an explication of the latter). Ibn \u0060Abbs said, \u0060They were two sorcerers who used to teach [people] magic\u0027; it is also said that they were two angels that had been sent to teach [sorcery] to people as a trial from God. They taught not any man, without them saying, by way of counsel, \u0060We are but a temptation, a trial from God for people, so that He may test them when they are taught it: whoever learns it is a disbeliever, but whoever renounces it, he is a believer; do not disbelieve\u0027, by learning it; if this person refused and insisted on learning it, they would teach him. From them they learned how they might cause division between a man and his wife, so that they would hate each other, yet they, the sorcerers, did not hurt any man thereby, that is, by this magic, save by the leave of God, by His will; and they learned what hurt them, in the Hereafter, and did not profit them, and this was sorcery. And surely (the lm [of la-qad, \u0060surely\u0027] is for oaths) they, the Jews, knew well that whoever (la- man: the lm denotes [part of] the subject of the sentence and is semantically connected to what precedes it; the man introduces the relative clause) buys it, [whoever] chooses it and took it in place of God\u0027s Book, he shall have no share in the Hereafter, that is, no portion of Paradise; evil then would have been, the thing, that they sold themselves for, those sellers, that is to say, the portion due for this [act] in the Hereafter, if they were to learn it; for it would have made the Fire obligatory in their case; if they had but known, the reality of the chastisement they would be destined for, they would not have learnt it.",
  "Yet if only they, the Jews, had believed, in the Prophet and the Qur\u0027n, and been fearful, of God\u0027s chastisement, by abandoning acts of disobedience towards Him, such as sorcery (the response to the [conditional clause beginning with] law, \u0060if\u0027, has been omitted, [but it is intimated to be] \u0060they would have been rewarded\u0027, and this is indicated by [His following words]) verily, a reward from God would have been better, than that for which they sold themselves, if they had but known, that this is better they would not have preferred that over this (la-mathbatun, \u0060verily the reward\u0027, is the subject; the lm is that of oaths; and min \u0060indi\u0027Llhi khayrun, \u0060from God, would have been better\u0027, is the predicate).",
  "O you who believe, do not say, to the Prophet (s), \u0060Observe us\u0027, (r\u0060in is an imperative form from mur\u0060t) which they used to say to him, and this was a derogatory term in Hebrew, derived from the noun al-ru\u0060na [\u0060thoughtlessness\u0027]. They found this very amusing and used to address the Prophet (s) in this way, and so the believers were forbidden to use it; but say, instead, \u0060Regard us\u0027, that is, look at us, and give ear, to what you are commanded and be prepared to accept it; and for disbelievers awaits a painful chastisement, that is, the Fire.",
  "Those disbelievers of the People of the Scripture and the idolaters, from among the Arabs (al-mushrikna, \u0060idolaters\u0027, is a supplement to ahl al-kitbi, \u0060People of the Scripture\u0027, and the min, \u0060of\u0027, is explicative), do not wish that any good, any Inspiration, should be revealed to you from your Lord, out of envy of you, but God singles out for His mercy, [for] the office of His Prophet, whom He will; God is of bounty abounding.",
  "When the disbelievers began to deride the matter of abrogation, saying that one day Muhammad enjoins his Companions to one thing and then the next day he forbids it, God revealed: And whatever verse (m is the conditional particle), that has been revealed containing a judgement, We abrogate, either together with its recital or not [that is only its judgement, but its recital continues]; there is a variant reading, nunsikh, meaning \u0060[Whatever verse] We command you or Gabriel to abrogate\u0027, or postpone, so that We do not reveal the judgement contained in it, and We withhold its recital or retain it in the Preserved Tablet; a variant reading [of nunsi\u0027h] is nunsih, from \u0060to forget\u0027: so \u0060[Whatever verse We abrogate] or We make you forget, that is, We erase from your heart\u0027; the response to the conditional sentence [begun with m] is: We bring [in place] a better, one that is more beneficial for [Our] servants, either because it is easier [to implement] or contains much reward; or the like of it, in terms of religious obligation and reward; do you not know that God has power over all things?, including abrogating and substituting [verses]? (the interrogative here is meant as an affirmative).",
  "Do you not know that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, doing what He pleases, and that you have none, besides God, other than God, neither protector, to safeguard you, nor helper?, to keep away His chastisement when it comes.",
  "When the Meccans asked [the Prophet] to enlarge the size of Mecca and make Saf full of gold, the following was revealed: Or do you desire to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned, by his people, aforetime?, when they asked him to show them God openly among other things; whoever exchanges belief for unbelief, taking the latter in place of the former by refraining from contemplating the clear proofs and by requesting others instead, has surely strayed from the even way, meaning, he has mistaken the proper path (al-saw\u0060 essentially means al-wasat, \u0060middle way\u0027).",
  "Many of the People of the Scripture long that (law, \u0060[if only] that\u0027, represents [the import of] the verbal noun) they might make you disbelievers, after you have believed, from the envy (hasadan is the object denoting reason), being, of their own souls, that is to say, their wicked souls have prompted them to this [attitude]; after the truth, with regard to the Prophet (s), has become clear to them, in the Torah; yet pardon, leave them be, and be forgiving, stay away, and make no encroachments against them, till God brings His command, concerning fighting them; truly God has power over all things.",
  "And perform the prayer, and pay the alms; whatever good, in the way of obedience, such as [observing] kinship and charity, you shall offer for your own souls, you shall find it, that is, its reward, with God; assuredly God sees what you do, and will requite you for it.",
  "And they say, \u0060None shall enter Paradise except those who are Jews (hd is the plural of h\u0027id) or Christians\u0027: this is what the Jews of Medina and the Christians of Najrn said when they disputed with the Prophet (s), each party separately claiming Paradise for its members exclusively. Such, sayings, are their desires, their false passions. Say, to them: \u0060Produce your proof, your evidence for this, if you speak truly\u0027, in this matter.",
  "Nay, but, others will also enter Paradise, namely, whoever submits his purpose to God, that is, adheres to His commands (wajh, \u0060face\u0027 [sc. \u0060purpose\u0027], is here mentioned because it is the most noble part of the body, so that [when it has submitted] there is all the more reason for the other parts [to follow]), being virtuous, affirming God\u0027s Oneness, his reward is with his Lord, the reward of his deeds being Paradise, and no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve, in the Hereafter.",
  "The Jews say, \u0060The Christians stand on nothing\u0027, that can be used as support [for their claims], and they rejected Jesus; and the Christians say, \u0060The Jews stand on nothing\u0027, that can be used as support [for their claims], and they rejected Moses; yet they, both groups, recite the Scripture, revealed to them: in the Scripture of the Jews there is the confirmation of Jesus, and in that of the Christians there is the confirmation of Moses (yatlna\u0027l-kitba, \u0060they recite the Scripture\u0027: the sentence is a circumstantial qualifier). Thus, in the way that these have said, the ignorant, from among the Arabs and others, say the like of what these say (this last phrase [mithla qawlihim, \u0060the like of what they say\u0027] is the explication of dhlika, \u0060that [way]\u0027): that is to say, to every person of religion they would say, \u0060You have no basis\u0027; God shall decide between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences, in religion and will admit the confirmer into Paradise and the falsifier into the Fire.1568039483",
  "And who does greater evil -- that is, none does more evil -- than he who bars God\u0027s places of worship, so that His Name be not invoked in them, in prayer and praise, and strives to ruin them?, through destruction and impeding people from them: this was revealed to inform of the Byzantines\u0027 destruction of the Holy House [sc. Jerusalem], or [it was revealed] when the idolaters barred the Prophet (s) from entering Mecca in the year of the battle of Hudaybiyya; such men might never enter them, save in fear (ill kh\u0027ifna is a predicate, also functioning as a command, that is to say, \u0060Frighten them by threats of waging war against them, so that not one of them shall enter it feeling secure\u0027); for them in this world is degradation, debasement through being killed, taken captive and forced to pay the jizya; and in the Hereafter a mighty chastisement, namely, the Fire.",
  "The following was revealed either when the Jews criticised the change of the direction of prayer [qibla], or concerning the supererogatory prayers on animal-back during journeys, which one may pray in any direction: To God belong the East and the West, that is, the entire earth, because these two [directions] represent both sides of it [the earth]; whithersoever you turn, your faces in prayer by His command, there is the Face of God, the direction of prayer with which He is pleased. Lo! God is Embracing, His bounty embracing all things, Knowing, how to manage His creation.",
  "And they, the Jews and the Christians, and those that claim that the angels are God\u0027s daughters, say (read wa-ql or [simply] ql) \u0060God has taken to Himself a son\u0027; God says: Glory be to Him!, as a way of exalting Himself above this; Nay, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants, and this sovereignty contradicts having a child, and is expressed by [the particle] m, \u0060all that\u0027, in order to include all [creation] that is not rational; all obey His will, submitting to that which is required from each one of them: here the emphasis is on rational beings.",
  "Creator of the heavens and the earth, making them exist without any exemplary precedent; and when He decrees, wills, a thing, to exist, He but says to it \u0060Be\u0027 and it is, that is to say, it becomes (fa-yaknu: a variant reading has fa-yakna, on account of it being the response [in the subjunctive mood] to the jussive statement).",
  "And they, that is the disbelievers of Mecca, who do not know, say, to the Prophet (s): \u0060Why does God not speak to us?, [to say] that you are His Messenger; Why does a sign not come to us?\u0027, of the sort we have requested in order to show your sincerity. So, in the same way that these [disbelievers] have spoken, spoke those before them, from among past communities, to their prophets, the like of what they say, in [their] obstinacy and demand for signs; their hearts are much alike, in terms of unbelief and stubbornness: this is meant as consolation for the Prophet (s). Yet We have made clear the signs to a people who are certain, [a people] who know that these are [God\u0027s] signs and so they believe in them, for to request other signs would be obduracy.",
  "We have sent you, Muhammad (s), with the truth, the guidance, a bearer of good tidings, of Paradise, for those who respond to this [guidance], and warner, of the Fire, to those who do not respond to it. You shall not be asked about the inhabitants of Hell-fire, that is, about why the disbelievers did not believe, for your responsibility is only to deliver the Message (a variant reading of l tus\u0027al is l tas\u0027al, \u0060do not ask\u0027, with the final apocopation of the vowel on account of it being an imperative).",
  "Never will the Jews be pleased with you, neither the Christians, not until you follow their creed, their religion, Say: \u0060God\u0027s guidance, that is, Islam, is the true guidance\u0027, besides which there is only error. And if you were (wa-la-in: the lm is for oaths) to follow their whims, hypothetically speaking, [whims] to which they are calling you, after the knowledge, the Divine revelation, that has come to you, you shall have against God neither friend, to protect you, nor helper, to defend you against Him.",

  "O Children of Israel, remember My favour wherewith I favoured you, and that I have preferred you over all the worlds: a similar verse has already been mentioned.",
  "And beware of, fear, a day when no soul shall for another, on this [Day] be requited, that is, [when no soul for another] shall be of any avail, and no compensation, no ransom, shall be accepted from it, nor any intercession shall benefit it, neither shall they be helped, against God\u0027s chastisement.",
  "And, mention, when his Lord tested, tried, Abraham (Ibrhm: also read Ibrhm) with certain words, with certain commands and prohibitions with which He charged him: it is said that these included the rituals of the Pilgrimage, the rinsing of the mouth, snuffing up water into the nostrils [to clean them], cleaning of the teeth, trimming facial hair, combing of the hair, trimming the fingernails, shaving armpit and pubic hair, circumcision and washing one\u0027s private parts after elimination; and he fulfilled them, he performed them thoroughly; He, God, exalted, said, to him: \u0060I make you a leader, an exemplar in religion, for the people.\u0027 Said he, \u0060And of my seed?\u0027, my progeny, make leaders [from among them]; He said, \u0060My covenant, of leadership, shall not reach the evildoers\u0027, the disbelievers from among them: this indicates that [the covenant] will reach only those who are not evildoers.",
  "And when We appointed the House, the Ka\u0060ba, to be a place of visitation, to which they flock from every direction, for the people, and a sanctuary, of safety for them from the injustice and attacks that befall other places: a person could come across his father\u0027s killer there, and yet not act violently against him; and: \u0060Take (ittakhidh is also read ittakhadh, making it a predicate), O people, to yourselves Abraham\u0027s station, the founding stone he used when building the House, for a place of prayer\u0027, so that you perform two units of prayer for the circumambulation; And We made a covenant with Abraham and Ishmael, We commanded them: \u0060Purify My House, of graven images, for those that shall go round it and those that cleave to it, in ritual residence, to those who bow and prostrate themselves\u0027, that is, those who pray: (al-rukka\u0060 and al- sujd are the plurals of rki\u0060, \u0060one bowing\u0027, and sjid, \u0060one prostrated\u0027, respectively).",
  "And when Abraham said, \u0060My Lord, make this, place, a land secure, in which there is safety: God granted him his request, making it a sanctuary in which no human blood is shed, no injustice is committed towards anyone, no prey is hunted and which is never deserted in any of its parts; and provide its people with fruits: something which actually happened when there came itinerants from as far as Syria, whereas before, it had been devoid of any vegetation or water; such of them as believe in God and the Last Day\u0027 (this phrase stands in place of its people, and they are here singled out for mention in the request in accordance with God\u0027s saying My covenant shall not reach the evildoers); He, exalted, said, \u0060And whoever disbelieves, I will also provide with fruits, to him I shall give enjoyment (read either umti\u0060uhu or umatti\u0060uhu), by granting him sustenance in this life, a little, the length of his life, but then I shall compel him, I shall drive him in the Hereafter to the chastisement of the Fire, so that he cannot find an escape -- how evil a journey\u0027s end!\u0027, a place to which to return.",
  "And, mention, when Abraham raised up the foundations, the supports or the walls, of the House, building it (min al-bayt, \u0060of the House\u0027, is semantically connected to yarfa\u0060u, \u0060raises up\u0027), and Ishmael with him (wa- Ism\u0060lu is a supplement to Ibrhmu), both of them saying: \u0060Our Lord! Receive this, building, from us. Truly You are the Hearing, of words, the Knowing, of deeds.",
  "Our Lord! And make us submissive, compliant, to You and, make, of our seed, our progeny, a community, a people, submissive to You (min [in the phrase min dhurriyyatin, \u0060of our seed\u0027] here is partitive, and is used here in accordance with God\u0027s above-mentioned saying My covenant shall not reach the evildoers); and show us, teach us, our holy rites, our ceremonies for worship or for the pilgrimage, and relent to us. Surely You are the Relenting, the Merciful: they asked Him to turn towards them, despite their [moral] impeccability, out of humbleness and in order to teach their progeny.",
  "Our Lord! And send among them, the people of this House, a messenger, one of them and God granted him this petition with [the sending of] Muhammad (s), who shall recite to them Your signs, the Qur\u0027n, and teach them the Book, the Qur\u0027n, and Wisdom, that is, what the former contains of judgments, and purify them, cleanse them of idolatry; You are the Mighty, the Victor, the Wise, in His creation.",
  "Who therefore, meaning \u0060none\u0027, shrinks from the religion of Abraham, abandoning it, except he who fools himself?, that is to say, either the one who ignores that his soul has been created for God, and that it is obliged to worship Him, or the one who treats it with frivolity and degrades it. Indeed We chose him, We elected him, in this world, for prophethood and friendship, and in the Hereafter he shall be among the righteous, those of the high stations [al-darajt al-\u0060ul, cf. Q. 20:75].",
  "And mention: When his Lord said to him, \u0060Submit\u0027, obey God and devote your religion purely to Him, he said, \u0060I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds\u0027.",
  "And Abraham enjoined (wass; may also be read aws) upon his sons this, creed, and [so did] Jacob, upon his sons, saying: \u0060My sons, God has chosen for you the [true] religion, the religion of submission [to God] (islm), see that you die not save in submission: he forbade them from abandoning this submission [to God], and enjoined them to adhere firmly to it until death overtook them.",
  "When the Jews said to the Prophet (s), \u0060Do you not know that on the day of his death Jacob charged his sons with Judaism?\u0027, the following was revealed: Or, were you witnesses, present, when death came to Jacob? When (idh, \u0060when\u0027, substitutes for the preceding idh) he said to his sons, \u0060What will you worship after me?\u0027, after I die?; They said, \u0060We will worship your God and the God of your fathers Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac (in recognition of the predominant [mention of the father figures] Ishmael is also counted as a father, and also because the status of an uncle is akin to that of a father), One God (ilhan whidan, \u0060One God\u0027, substitutes for ilhaka, \u0060your God\u0027), to Him we submit\u0027 (the initial am [of the phrase am kuntum, \u0060Or, were you ...\u0027] is similar to the hamza of denial [sc. a-kuntum], the sense being, \u0060You were not present at his death, so how do you ascribe to him what does not befit him?\u0027).",
  "That (tilka, is the subject of this sentence and denotes Abraham, Jacob and his sons, and is feminine because it agrees with the gender of its predicate) is a community that has passed away, has gone before; theirs is what they have earned, the reward for their deeds (lah m kasabat, theirs is what they have earned\u0027, constitutes the commencement of a new sentence) and yours (the Jews are being addressed here) is what you have earned; you shall not be asked about what they did, in the same way that they will not be asked about what you did, this latter statement being an affirmation of the former.",
  "And they say, \u0060Be Jews or Christians (the particle aw is for detail; the first of these is the saying of the Medinan Jews, while the second is that of the Christians of Najrn), and you shall be guided\u0027. Say, to them: \u0060Nay, we follow, rather the creed of Abraham, a hanf (hanfan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to Ibrhma, that is to say, one that inclines away from all other religions to the upright religion); and he was not of the idolaters\u0027.",
  "Say: (this address is to the believers) \u0060We believe in God, and in that which has been revealed to us, the Qur\u0027n, and revealed to Abraham, the ten scrolls, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, his sons, and that which was given to Moses, the Torah, and Jesus, the Gospel, and the prophets, from their Lord, of Books and signs, we make no division between any of them, believing in some and disbelieving in others in the manner of Jews and Christians, and to Him we submit\u0027.",
  "And if they, the Jews and the Christians, believe in the like (mithl, \u0060the like\u0027 is extra) of what you believe in, then they are truly guided; but if they turn away, from belief in it, then they are clearly in schism, in opposition to you; God will suffice you, O Muhammad (s), against them, and their schisms; He is the Hearer, of their sayings, the Knower, of their circumstances: God sufficed him [with regard to them] by killing Qurayza, expelling Nadr and exacting the jizya from them.",
  "The mark of God (sibghata\u0027Llhi: a verbal noun reaffirming the earlier mann, and it is in the accusative, because of the verbal construction implied, that is to say, sabaghan\u0027Llhu, \u0060God has marked us\u0027): this denotes His religion, the one towards which He made human beings naturally inclined, as it leaves its mark on a person, in the same way that a dye leaves its mark on a garment; and who has, that is, none [has], a better mark (sibghatan, \u0060marking\u0027, is for specification) than God? And Him we worship: the Jews said to the Muslims, \u0060We are the people of the first Book and our direction of prayer (qibla) is more ancient, and prophets were never sent from among the Arabs; if Muhammad were a prophet, he would have been one of us\u0027. Thus, the following was revealed:",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Would you then dispute with us concerning God, that He chose a prophet from among the Arabs, and He is our Lord and your Lord?, and so it is for Him to choose whom He will, Our deeds belong to us, for which we will be requited, and to you belong your deeds, for which you will be requited, so that it is not improbable that among our deeds there will be those for which we will deserve to be honoured; and to Him we are sincerely devoted, in religion and in deed, unlike you, hence, we are more worthy to be chosen (the hamza [of a-tuhjjnan, \u0060would you then dispute\u0027] is for rejection, and the three clauses that follow it are all circumstantial qualifiers).",
  "Or, nay, do you say (taqlna, also read yaqlna, \u0060do they say?\u0027): \u0060Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob, and the Tribes -- they were Jews, or they were Christians?\u0027 Say, to them: \u0060Have you then greater knowledge, or has God?, that is, God has greater knowledge; He dissociated Abraham from both [groups], when He said, Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian [Q. 3:67]; and those mentioned with him [Abraham] are his followers [in not belonging to either group]. And who does greater injustice than he who conceals, hides from people, a testimony, he has, received from God?, that is, there is none more unjust than him: these are the Jews, for they concealed God\u0027s testimony about Abraham\u0027s pure faith in the Torah; And God is not heedless of what you do\u0027: [this is] a threat for them.",
  "That is a community that has passed away; theirs is what they have earned, and yours is what you have earned; you shall not be asked about what they did: a similar [verse] has already been mentioned above.",
  "The fools, the ignorant, among the people, that is, the Jews and the idolaters, will say, \u0060What, matter, has turned them, the Prophet (s) and the believers, from the direction they were facing in their prayers formerly?\u0027, this being the Holy House (bayt al-maqdis, sc. Jerusalem); the sn [of sa-yaqlu, \u0060they will say\u0027] denotes the future tense and informs of the Unseen. Say: \u0060To God belong the East and the West, that is, all directions. Thus He commands that they face whichever direction He wills, and there can be no objection. He guides whomever He will, His guidance being, to a straight path\u0027, that is, the religion of Islam, and you are among these [guided ones].",
  "Thus, in the same way that We guided you to it, We appointed you, O community of Muhammad (s), a midmost community, excellent and upright, that you might be witnesses to the people, on the Day of Resurrection, that their messengers delivered [the Message] to them; and that the Messenger might be a witness to you, that he delivered [the Message] to you, and We did not appoint, make, the direction, for you now, the direction, you were facing, that is the Ka\u0060ba: the Prophet (s) used to face it in prayer, but when he emigrated he was commanded to face the Holy House [of Jerusalem], in order to win the hearts of the Jews. He prayed in this direction for sixteen or seventeen months before he changed direction; except that We might know, [that it become] manifest knowledge, who followed the Messenger, and believed in him, from him who turned on his heels, and returned to unbelief doubting the religion and thinking that the Prophet (s) was confused about this issue; and a number of them apostatised as a result of this-- though it, the change of direction, were (wa-in, \u0060though\u0027, is softened, and its noun apocopated, originally being: wa-innah) a grave thing, troublesome for people, save for those, of them, whom God has guided; but God would never cause your faith, that is, your prayers towards the Holy House [of Jerusalem], to be wasted, but He will reward you for them (the reason that this [verse] was revealed was that some had asked about the status of those that had died before the change of direction [of prayer]); truly, God is Gentle with, believing, people, Merciful, when He does not let their deeds go to waste (al-ra\u0027fa means \u0060intensity of mercy\u0027, and is mentioned first to allow for the end rhyme of the verse [with the preceding one]).",
  "We have indeed (qad, \u0060indeed\u0027, is for affirmation) seen you turning your face about in the, direction of the, heaven, looking around for the Revelation and longing for the command to face the Ka\u0060ba: he [the Prophet] wished for this because it was the prayer-direction of Abraham and would be more conducive to the submission of the Arabs [to Islam]; now We will surely turn you to a direction that shall satisfy you, that you will love. Turn your face, in prayer, towards the Sacred Mosque, that is, the Ka\u0060ba, and wherever you are (addressing the [Muslim] community) turn your faces, in prayer, towards it. Those who have been given the Scripture know that it, the change towards the Ka\u0060ba, is the, fixed, truth from their Lord, on account of the description in their Scripture of how the Prophet (s) would re-orient himself to it; God is not heedless of what you do, O believers, when you obey His command (alternatively, ta\u0060malna, \u0060you do\u0027, can be read ya\u0060malna, \u0060they do\u0027, in other words [it would be referring to] the Jews\u0027 denial of the matter concerning the direction of prayer).",
  "Yet if (wa-la-in: the lm is for oaths) you should bring to those who have been given the Scripture every sign, about your truthfulness in the matter of the direction of prayer, they will not follow your direction, out of obduracy, and you are not a follower of their direction (this is a categorical negation of his [the Prophet\u0027s] desire that they become Muslims and of their desire that he return to their direction of prayer; neither are they, the Jews and the Christians, followers of one another\u0027s direction. If you were to follow their whims, the ones to which they summon you, after the knowledge, the revelation, that has come to you, then you, if, hypothetically, you were to follow them, will surely be among the evildoers.",
  "Those to whom We have given the Scripture, they recognise him, Muhammad (s), as they recognise their sons, because of the descriptions of him in their Scripture: [\u0060Abd Allh] Ibn Salm said, \u0060I recognised him the moment I saw him, as I would my own son; but my recognition of Muhammad (s) was more intense\u0027; even though there is a party of them that conceal the truth, that is, his description, while they know, this [truth] which you [Muhammad (s)] follow.",
  "The truth comes from your Lord; then be not among the doubters, who doubt it, that is to say, \u0060[be not] of such a disposition\u0027, which is more eloquent than merely saying, \u0060do not waver\u0027.",
  "Every person, of every community, has his direction (wijha), [his] qibla, to which he turns (muwallh, \u0060he turns to it\u0027, is also read as muwallh, \u0060he is made to turn to it\u0027), in his prayers, so vie with one another in good works, strive with acts of obedience and acceptance of these. Wherever you may be, God will bring you all together, gathering you on the Day of Resurrection and requiting you for your deeds; surely God has power over all things.",
  "From whatever place you issue, on a journey, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; it is the truth from your Lord. God is not heedless of what you do (ta\u0060malna, \u0060you do\u0027, may also be read as ya\u0060malna, \u0060they do\u0027, as already appears above [sc. 2:144]; its repetition is intended to point out that the stipulation applies equally to being on a journey or otherwise).",
  "From whatever place you issue, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you may be, turn your faces towards it (all of which is being repeated for emphasis), so that there be not any argument from the people, the Jews or the idolaters, against you, [so that there be not] any cause for contention regarding the change to a different direction of prayer. In this way, their contentions against you will cease to exist, both [the contentions] of the Jews when they say, \u0060He [Muhammad (s)] rejects our religion, but follows our direction of prayer\u0027, and of the idolaters when they say, \u0060He [Muhammad (s)] claims to follow the creed of Abraham, but he contravenes his [Abraham\u0027s] qibla\u0027; excepting the evildoers among them, acting in obstinacy, who will say, \u0060He [Muhammad (s)] only changed to this direction because of his [natural] inclination towards the [idolatrous] religion of his forefathers\u0027. The exceptive statement [indicated by ill] is a continuous one, the meaning being: \u0060No one will have anything to say against you, except for what these people say\u0027; and do not fear them, do not fear their arguing [with you] regarding the change to it [the Ka\u0060ba], but fear Me, by complying with My command; and that I may perfect My grace upon you, by guiding you to the principal rituals of your religion, and that you may be guided, to the truth (wa-li-utimma, \u0060that I may perfect\u0027, is a supplement to li-all yakna, \u0060that there be not\u0027).",
  "As also We have sent (this [verbal clause ka-m arsaln, \u0060as We have sent\u0027] is semantically connected to wa- li-utimma [of the previous verse], that is to say, \u0060[Also We have sent] by way of perfection\u0027); as it [My grace] has been perfected by Our sending, among you, of yourselves, Muhammad (s), a messenger, to recite Our verses, the Qur\u0027n, to you and to purify you, to cleanse you from idolatry, and to teach you the Book, the Qur\u0027n, and wisdom, the rulings therein, and to teach you what you knew not.",
  "So remember Me, through prayer, glorification and the like, I will remember you: this is said to mean, \u0060I will reward you\u0027; in a hadth about God [that He says]: \u0060whoever remembers Me in himself, I will remember him in Myself, and whoever remembers Me in an assembly, I will remember him in an Assembly more excellent than his\u0027; and be thankful to Me, for My grace, by being obedient, and be not ungrateful towards Me, through disobedience.",
  "O you who believe, seek help, regarding the Hereafter, through patience, in obedience and afflictions, and prayer (He singles it out for mention on account of its frequency and its greatness); surely God is with the patient, helping them.",
  "And say not of those slain in God\u0027s way, that, \u0060They are dead\u0027; rather they are living, their spirits are, according to a hadth, contained in green birds that take wing freely wherever they wish in Paradise; but you are not aware, [but you] do not know their condition.",
  "Surely We will try you with something of fear, of an enemy, and hunger, by way of drought, and diminution of goods, as a result of destruction, and lives, as a result of slaughter, death and disease, and fruits, by way of crop damage: that is to say, We will try you to see if you practise patience or not; yet give good tidings, of Paradise, to the patient, during calamities;",
  "those who, when they are struck by an affliction, a calamity, say, \u0060Surely we belong to God, we are His possession and servants, with whom He does as He pleases; and to Him we will return\u0027, in the Hereafter, whereupon He will requite us: in one hadth [it is said that], \u0060whoever pronounces the istirj\u0060 [sc. the formula \u0060surely we belong to God and to Him we will return\u0027] when an affliction befalls him, God will reward him and compensate him with what is better\u0027. Similarly, it is said that on one occasion when his lamp blew out, the Prophet (s) uttered the istirj\u0060, whereupon \u0060\u0027isha said to him, saying: \u0060But, it is just a lamp\u0027, to which he replied, \u0060Whatever bothers a believer is an affliction [of sorts]\u0027: this is reported by Ab Dwd in his [section on] mursal reports.",
  "Upon those rest blessings, forgiveness, and mercy, grace, from their Lord, and those -- they are the truly guided, to rectitude.",
  "Truly Saf and Marwa, two mountains near Mecca, are among the waymarks (sha\u0060\u0027ir, plural of sha\u0060ra) of God, the [ritual] ceremonies of His religion, so whoever makes the Pilgrimage to the House, or the Visitation, that is, whoever prepares to perform the Pilgrimage [hajj] or the Visitation [\u0060umra]: the original sense of both terms [hajja and i\u0060tamara] is \u0060to aim for\u0027 and \u0060to visit\u0027, respectively; he would not be at fault, [it would not be] a sin, if he circumambulates them (the original t\u0027 [of yatatawwafa, \u0060circumambulate\u0027] has been assimilated with the t\u0027), by pacing quickly (sa\u0060y) between them seven times: this was revealed when the Muslims were averse to this [circumambulation], because the pagan Arabs used to circumambulate them, and there was an idol atop each mountain which they used to stroke. It is reported from Ibn \u0060Abbs that this pacing [between the two] is not obligatory, based on the fact that when no sin can be incurred, the context implies free choice. Al-Shfi\u0060 and others, however, considered it to be a pillar [of the Pilgrimage rituals]. The Prophet made clear its obligatory aspect when he said that, \u0060God has prescribed for you the pacing [sa\u0060y]\u0027, as reported by al-Bayhaq and others; and he [the Prophet] also said, \u0060Begin with what God has begun\u0027, meaning, al-Saf, as reported by Muslim; and whoever volunteers (tatawwa\u0060a: a variant reading is yattawa\u0060, the ta\u0027 here being assimilated) good, that is, any good deed such as circumambulation or other, that is not obligatory on him; God is Grateful, for such a deed and rewards that person for it, Knowing, it.",
  "The following was revealed concerning the Jews: Those who conceal, from people, the clear proofs and the guidance that We have revealed, such as the \u0060stoning\u0027 verse and the description of Muhammad (s), after We have shown them clearly in the Scripture, the Torah -- they shall be cursed by God, that is, He will move them far away from His mercy, and by the cursers, the angels, believers, or by every single thing, when they supplicate that they be cursed.",
  "Except those that repent, turning back from such [deeds], and make amends, in their actions, and show clearly, what they were concealing -- them I shall turn [relenting], accepting their repentance; I am the Relenting, the Merciful, to believers.",
  "But those who disbelieve, and die disbelieving (wa-hum kuffr, \u0060they being disbelievers\u0027, is a circumstantial qualifier) -- upon them shall be the curse of God and the angels, and of people altogether, that is, they deserve such [a curse] in this life and in the next; \u0060people\u0027 here is said to be either [people] in general, or believers.",
  "Abiding therein, that is, [in] the curse and the Fire, [the latter] indicated by the following words: the chastisement shall not be lightened for them, [not even for] a blink of an eye, no respite shall be given them, in which to have time to repent or to excuse themselves.",
  "When they asked him [Muhammad (s)] to describe his Lord, the following was revealed: Your God, the One deserving of your worship, is One God, without any equal in either essence or attribute; there is no god except Him, He is the Compassionate, the Merciful.",
  "They then asked for a sign to prove this, and the following was revealed: Surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the marvels contained in them, and the alternation of the night and day, passing and returning, increasing and diminishing, and the ships that run in the sea, and do not become cracked and sink, with what profits men, of trade and merchandise, and the water, the rain, God sends down from the heaven with which He revives the earth, with vegetation, after it is dead, after it has dried out, and He scatters abroad in it all manner of crawling thing, by dividing them and spreading them throughout on account of the vegetation, for they thrive on the fertile pastures it produces; and the disposition of the winds, changing it from south to north, from cold to warm, and the clouds compelled, subjugated by God\u0027s command, moving to wherever God wishes, between heaven and the earth, without being attached [to either of the two] -- surely there are signs, indicating His Oneness, exalted be He, for a people who comprehend, [a people] who contemplate.",
  "Yet there be people who take to themselves compeers, idols, besides God, that is, other than God, loving them, by magnifying them and being subservient to them, as God is loved, that is, as their love of Him; but those who believe love God more ardently, than those who love their compeers, because the former never reject God, whereas the latter when faced with hardship soon abandon those [compeers] for God; If he, [if you] O Muhammad (s), were to see those who did evil, by taking to themselves compeers, when (idh here denotes idh) they see (read either as active [yarawna, \u0060they see\u0027] or passive [yurawna, \u0060they are made to see\u0027]) the chastisement, you would see a grave sight, that, this is because, the might, the power and the vanquishing, altogether (a circumstantial qualifier) belongs to God, and that God is terrible in chastisement (according to one reading, the person listening [to the verse] governs the verb yar, \u0060he sees\u0027, and constitutes the subject [of the clause]; according to another [reading], it is the \u0060evildoers\u0027 [who constitute the subject of the clause and govern the verb yar]; and so it [yar] has the sense of ya\u0060lam, \u0060he knows\u0027; the particle an, \u0060that\u0027, and what comes after it have taken the place of the objects in both cases; the response to the [initial conditional] law, \u0060if\u0027, has been omitted). The general meaning [of the verse] then is: \u0060If they were aware in this world of the severity of God\u0027s chastisement and of the fact that power is God\u0027s alone, the moment they come to see it with their own eyes, on the Day of Resurrection, they would not take to themselves compeers\u0027.",
  "When (idh here substitutes for the previous idh) those who were followed, that is, the leaders, disown their followers, that is to say, [when] they have denied misleading them [the latter], and they have seen the chastisement, and the cords, the bonds of affection and kinship that were between them on earth, are cut away before them, from them (taqatta\u0060at, \u0060cut away\u0027, is a supplement to tabarra\u0027a, \u0060disown\u0027).",
  "And those who followed say, \u0060O, if only we might return again, to the world, and disown them, the ones who had been followed, as they have disowned us!\u0027, on this day (the particle law, \u0060if only\u0027, is an optative, and its response is natabarra\u0027a, \u0060we disown\u0027). So, just as He showed them the severity of His chastisement and their disowning of one another, so too, God shall show them their, evil, works, as, anguish (hasart is a circumstantial qualifier), regrets, for them! Never shall they exit from the Fire, once they have entered it.",
  "The following was revealed when some said that it was unlawful to take a camel that has been let loose (saw\u0027ib): O people, eat of what is in the earth, lawful (hallan is a circumstantial qualifier) and wholesome (tayyiban is an adjective for emphasis), that is to say, what is delicious; and follow not the steps, the ways, of Satan, meaning, what he embellishes [of temptations]; he is a manifest foe to you, whose enmity is clear;",
  "he only commands you to evil, sin, and indecency, what is abhorred by the Law, and that you should speak against God what you do not know, such as forbidding what He has not forbidden and otherwise.",
  "And when it is said to them, the disbelievers, \u0060Follow what God has revealed\u0027, pertaining to affirmation of God\u0027s Oneness and the good things that He has made lawful, they say, \u0060No; but we follow what we found our fathers doing\u0027, in the way of idol-worship, deeming unlawful the camel let loose, and [practising] the slitting of the camel\u0027s ear (sc. bahra). God says: What? (the hamza [of a-wa-law] is for repudiation), do they follow them, Even if their fathers do not understand anything, concerning religion, and they were not guided?, to the truth.",
  "The likeness, the attribute, of those who disbelieve, and the one who calls them to guidance, is as the likeness of one who shouts to that which hears nothing, save a call and a cry, only a sound, not understanding its meaning: when they listen to an admonition they are like cattle that hear the cry of their shepherd but do not understand what he is saying; they are deaf, dumb, blind -- they do not comprehend, any admonition.",
  "O you who believe, eat of the good things, that are lawful, wherewith We have provided you, and give thanks to God, for what He has made lawful for you, if it be Him that you worship.",
  "He has only forbidden you: carrion, that is, the consumption of it, since this is the subject of the general address here, and similarly [the consumption of] what follows, [all of] which is what has not been slaughtered in accordance with [prescriptions of] the Law; to this the Sunna adds [as also constituting carrion] what has been severed from a living creature. A special status is, however, accorded fish and locusts; blood, poured forth, as in [srat] al-An\u0060m [see Q. 6:145], the flesh of swine, the meat is singled out for mention because that [part] is what people mostly seek, every other [part] being implied thereby; what has been hallowed to other than God, that is to say, what has been slaughtered in other than His Name (al-ihll is the raising of one\u0027s voice, which they used to do when sacrificing for their gods). Yet whoever is constrained, forced by dire need to eat of the above-mentioned, not desiring, to rebel against Muslims, nor transgressing, committing aggression against them by waylaying them, no sin shall be on him, for eating it. God is Forgiving, to His friends, Merciful, to those who are obedient to Him, for He has granted them wide berth in this matter. The aggressor and the transgressor are excluded from this [dispensation], and to these two [categories] one should also add every person that sets out on a journey in disobedience, such as the fugitive or the excise collector, for whom it would be unlawful to eat any of the mentioned, unless they repent [of their disobedience]; this is the opinion of al-Shfi\u0060.",
  "Those who conceal what God has revealed of the Scripture, comprising all the descriptions of Muhammad (s), meaning the Jews, and sell it for a little price, in this world, taking this [little price] in its place from the debased ones among them, for fear of losing out if they were to manifest it [sc. the truth of Muhammad (s)] -- they shall consume nothing in their bellies but the Fire, because that is their journey\u0027s end; God shall not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, out of anger with them, neither purify them, from the filth of sin; and theirs is a painful chastisement, that is, the Fire.",
  "Those are they that have bought error at the price of guidance, taking the former in place of the latter in this world, and chastisement at the price of pardon, [the pardon] that would have been prepared for them in the Hereafter, had they not concealed this matter; what makes them so patient for the Fire?, that is, how great is the extent of their patience? This [statement] is intended to provoke amazement in the believers at the way in which they [the disbelievers] commit sins that necessitate their punishment in the Fire with complete indifference. In reality they would have no patience whatever [to endure the Fire].",
  "That, which has been mentioned of their eating of the Fire and what follows it, is because God has revealed the Book with the truth, but they are at variance regarding it, believing in parts of it while disbelieving in others, and concealing them; and those that are at variance regarding the Book, concerning this matter, namely, the Jews -- although it is said that these are the idolaters some of whom said, with regard to the Qur\u0027n, that it was poetry, others, that it was sorcery, and others still, that it was divination -- are in schism, disagreement, far removed, from the truth.",
  "It is not piety, that you turn your faces, in prayer, to the East and to the West. This was revealed in response to the claim made by the Jews and the Christians to this effect. True piety, that is, the pious person (al-birr, is also read al-barr, in the sense of al-brr [\u0060the dutiful person\u0027]) is [that of] the one who believes in God and the Last Day and the angels and the Book, that is, the scriptures, and the prophets, and who gives of his substance, however, despite [it being], cherished, by him, to kinsmen and orphans and the needy and the traveller and beggars, and for, the setting free of, slaves, both the captive and the one to be manumitted by contract; and who observes prayer and pays the alms, that are obligatory, and what was [given] before [alms were made obligatory], in the way of charity; and those who fulfil their covenant when they have engaged in a covenant, with God or with others, those who endure with fortitude (al-sbirna is the accusative of laudation) misfortune (al-ba\u0027s\u0027 is abject poverty), hardship, illness, and peril, at the height of a battle in the way of God; these, described in the way mentioned, are the ones who are truthful, in their faith and in their claims to piety, and these are the ones who are fearful, of God.",
  "O you who believe, prescribed, made obligatory, for you is retaliation, on equal terms, regarding the slain, both in the attributes [of the one slain] and in the action involved; a free man, is killed, for a free man, and not for a slave; and a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. The Sunna makes it clear that a male may be killed [in retaliation] for a female, and that religious affiliation should be taken into account also, so that a Muslim cannot be killed in return for an disbeliever, even if the former be a slave and the latter a free man. But if anything, of the blood, is pardoned any one, of those who have slain, in relation to his brother, the one slain, so that the retaliation is waived (the use of the indefinite shay\u0027un, \u0060anything\u0027, here implies the waiving of retaliation through a partial pardon by the inheritors [of the slain]; the mention of akhh [\u0060his brother\u0027] is intended as a conciliatory entreaty to pardon and a declaration that killing should not sever the bonds of religious brotherhood; the particle man, \u0060any one\u0027, is the subject of a conditional or a relative clause, of which the predicate is [the following, fa\u0027ittib\u0060un]) let the pursuing, that is, the action of the one who has pardoned in pursuing the killer, be honourable, demanding the blood money without force. The fact that the \u0060pursuing\u0027 results from the \u0060pardoning\u0027 implies that one of the two [actions] is a duty, which is one of al-Shfi\u0060\u0027s two opinions here. The other [opinion] is that retaliation is the duty, whereas the blood money is merely compensation [for non-retaliation], so that if one were to pardon but not name his blood money, then nothing [happens]; and this [latter] is the preferred [opinion]. And let the payment, of the blood money by the slayer, to him, the pardoner, that is, the one inheriting [from the slain], be with kindliness, without procrastination or fraud; that, stipulation mentioned here about the possibility of retaliation and the forgoing of this in return for blood money, is an alleviation, a facilitation, given, to you, by your Lord, and a mercy, for you, for He has given you latitude in this matter and has not categorically demanded that one [of the said options] be followed through, in the way that He made it obligatory for Jews to retaliate and for Christians to [pardon and] accept blood money; and for him who commits aggression, by being unjust towards the killer and slaying him, after that, that is, [after] pardoning -- his is a painful chastisement, of the Fire in the Hereafter, or of being killed in this world.",
  "In retaliation there is life for you, that is great longevity, O people of pith, possessors of intellect, because if the would-be killer knew that he would be killed [in retaliation], he would refrain [from such action] and would have thereby given life to himself and to the one whom he had intended to kill; and so it [retaliation] was stipulated by the Law, so that you might fear killing, fearing retaliation.",
  "Prescribed, made obligatory, for you, when any of you is approached by death, that is, [by] its causes, and leaves behind some good, material possessions, is to make testament (al-wasiyyatu is in the nominative because of kutiba, and is semantically connected to the particle idh, \u0060when\u0027, if the latter is adverbial; but if this latter is conditional, then it [al-wasiyyatu] indicates the response; the response to the [conditional] particle in, \u0060if\u0027, is, in other words, [implied to be] fa\u0027l-ysi, \u0060let him make testament\u0027); in favour of his parents and kinsmen honourably, that is justly, not giving more than the allotted share of a third, nor preferring the richer person -- an obligation (haqqan here emphasises the import of what has preceded) on those that fear, God (this verse has been abrogated by the \u0060inheritance\u0027 verse [yat al-mrth, see Q. 4:11] and by the hadth: \u0060Do not make testament for one [already] inheriting\u0027, as reported by al-Tirmidh).",
  "Then if anyone, whether a witness or a trustee, changes it, that is, the testament, after hearing it, and knowing it, the sin, resulting from the changed testament, shall rest upon those who change it (here the explicit subject stands in place of the implicit one); surely God is Hearing, of the testator\u0027s words, Knowing, of the deeds of the trustee, requiting [each] accordingly.",
  "But if any one fears injustice, an error, in straying from what is right, or sin, because he has purposely increased the share of a third or specified a rich individual, from one making testament (read ms or muwass), and so makes things right between them, the testator and the trustee, by commanding that justice be done, then no sin shall be upon him, with regard to this matter; surely God is Forgiving, Merciful.",
  "O you who believe, prescribed for you, obligatory [for you], is the Fast, just as it was prescribed for those, communities, that were before you so that you might guard yourselves, against acts of disobedience, for, it [the fast] curbs the desires that prompt these [acts].",
  "For days (ayyman, \u0060days\u0027, is in the accusative as the object of al-siym, \u0060the fast\u0027, or of an implied yasm, \u0060he fasts\u0027) numbered, few or specific in number, that is, those of Ramadn, as will be mentioned below; God has specified a small number as a way of facilitating matters for those under the obligation; and if any of you, during the month, be sick, or be on a journey, in which prayers are shortened, or if one is strained by the fast in both cases and breaks it, then a number of other days, equal to the ones during which he broke his fast -- let him fast them instead; and for those who are, not, able to do it, [to fast] on account of old age or chronic illness, a redemption: which is, the feeding of a poor man, with about the same amount one consumes in a given day, that is, one mudd measure of the principal food of that town each day (a variant reading has [genitive] fidyatin as an explicative clause. It is also said that the [l] negation of the verb [yutqnahu] is not actually implied, because at the very beginning of Islam, they could choose between fasting or offering the redemption; but later on this was abrogated by fixing the Fast [as an obligation], where God says, So let those of you, who are present at the month, fast it [Q. 2:185]: Ibn \u0060Abbs said [by way of qualification] \u0060Except for the pregnant one and the one breastfeeding, if they break their fast out of concern for the child; in the case of these two, the verse remains valid and has not been abrogated\u0027). For him who volunteers good, by offering more than the minimum amount mentioned for the redemption; that, volunteering, is good for him; but that you should fast (wa-an tasm is the subject) is better for you (khayrun lakum is its predicate), than breaking the fast and paying the redemption, if you but knew, that this is better for you, then do it.",
  "These days of, the month of Ramadn, wherein the Qur\u0027n was revealed, from the Preserved Tablet to the earthly heaven on the Night of Ordainment [laylat al-qadr] from Him, a guidance (hudan, \u0060a guidance\u0027, is a circumstantial qualifier), guiding away from error, for the people, and as clear proofs, lucid verses, of the Guidance, the rulings that guide to truth, and, of, the Criterion, that discriminates between truth and falsehood; So let those of you, who are present at the month, fast it and if any of you be sick, or if he be on a journey, then a number of other days (this [concession] has already been mentioned, but it is repeated here to avoid the mistaken impression that it has been abrogated by the comprehensive implication of man shahida, \u0060who are present\u0027). God desires ease for you, and desires not hardship for you, and for this reason He has permitted you the breaking of the fast during illness or travel, [this ease being] the very reason He has commanded you to fast; He supplements [the previous statement with]: and that you fulfil (read tukmil or tukammil) the number, of the fasting days of Ramadn, and magnify God, when you have completed them, for having guided you, for having directed you to the principal rites of His religion, and that you might be thankful, to God for this.",
  "A group of followers of the Prophet (s) asked him, \u0060Is our Lord nearby so that we should talk to Him secretly, or is He far away, so that we should call out to him?\u0027, and the following was revealed: And when My servants question you concerning Me -- I am near, to them in My knowledge, and he informed them of this; I answer the call of the caller, by granting him his request, when he calls to Me; so let them respond to Me, My call to them to be obedient, and let them believe, [let them] persevere in faith, in Me that they might go aright, [that] they [might] become guided.",
  "Permitted to you, upon the night of the Fast, is to go in to your wives, in sexual intercourse: this was revealed as an abrogation of its unlawfulness during the earliest phase of Islam, as well as [an abrogation of] the unlawfulness of eating and drinking after the night prayer; they are a vestment for you, and you are a vestment for them (a metaphor for their embraces or their need for one another); God knows that you have been betraying yourselves, by having sexual intercourse on the eve of the fast: this happened with \u0060Umar [b. al-Khattb] and others, and they apologised to the Prophet (s), and so He has turned to you [relenting], before you even turned in repentance, and He has pardoned you. So now, when it is permitted to you, lie with them, in sexual intercourse, and seek what God has prescribed for you, of sexual intercourse or what it produces of offspring; and eat and drink, [at any time] during the night, until the white thread is distinct, to you, from the black thread at daybreak, that is, the true [moment of daybreak], which explains the white thread, while the explanation of the black thread, namely, the night, has been left out. The whiteness and the darkness of the dawn [twilight] are likened to two black and white threads in the way they stretch out; then complete the fast, from daybreak, to the night, that is, until it arrives, after the setting of the sun; and do not lie with them, your women, while you cleave to the mosques in devotion [to God], while you are residing [therein] with the intention of [performing] i\u0060tikf (\u0060spiritual retreat\u0027). This was a prohibition pertaining to one who used to leave [the mosque], whilst in a state of i\u0060tikf, have sexual intercourse with his wife, and then return. Those, rulings mentioned, are God\u0027s bounds, delimited by God for His servants so that they do not overstep them; do not approach them (l taqrabh, is more intense than l ta\u0060taddh, \u0060Do not overstep\u0027, used in verses elsewhere). So, just as He makes clear to you what has been mentioned, God makes clear His signs to people so that they might fear [disobeying] His prohibitions.",
  "Consume not your goods between you, that is to say, do not let one consume the goods of the other, in deception, that which is illicit according to the Law, such as theft and extortion; and, do not, proffer them, the regulation of these [goods] or any bribes, to the judges, that you may consume, as a result of any arbitration, a portion of other people\u0027s goods, embroiled, in sin while you are aware, that you are in error.",
  "They will ask you, O Muhammad (s), about the new moons (ahilla, plural of hill): \u0060Why do they seem very thin, and then wax until they are full of light, and then wane again as at the first, and are not always the same, in the way that the sun is?\u0027 Say, to them: \u0060They are appointed times (mawqt is the plural of mqt) for the people, for them to know the times for sowing the land, for business, for their women\u0027s waiting periods, their fast and their breaking it, and the Pilgrimage\u0027 (wa\u0027l-hajji and the Pilgrimage\u0027, is a supplement to li\u0027l-nsi, \u0060for the people\u0027), that is to say, [appointed times] by which its season is known, for if they [the new moons] always looked the same, none of these things could be known. It is not piety to come to the houses from their backs, in [your] state of pilgrimage inviolability (ihrm), when you would bore holes in them to enter them and then exit, disregarding their doors; they used to do this and claim that it was out of piety; but piety is to fear, God by not contravening His commands; so come to the houses by their doors, when in a state of pilgrimage inviolability, and fear God, that you may prosper, [that you may] triumph.",
  "After the Prophet (s) was prevented from [visiting] the House in the year of the battle of Hudaybiyya, he made a pact with the disbelievers that he would be allowed to return the following year, at which time they would vacate Mecca for three days. Having prepared to depart for the Visitation [\u0060umra], [he and] the believers were concerned that Quraysh would not keep to the agreement and instigate fighting. The Muslims were averse to becoming engaged in fighting while in a state of pilgrimage inviolability in the Sacred Enclosure [al-haram] and during the sacred months, and so the following was revealed: And fight in the way of God, to elevate His religion, with those who fight against you, the disbelievers, but aggress not, against them by initiating the fighting; God loves not the aggressors, the ones that overstep the bounds which God has set for them: this stipulation was abrogated by the verse of bar\u0027a, \u0060immunity\u0027 [Q. 9:1], or by His saying [below]:",
  "And slay them wherever you come upon them, and expel them from where they expelled you, that is, from Mecca, and this was done after the Conquest of Mecca; sedition, their idolatry, is more grievous, more serious, than slaying, them in the Sacred Enclosure or while in a state of pilgrimage inviolability, the thing that you greatly feared. But fight them not by the Sacred Mosque, that is, in the Sacred Enclosure, until they should fight you there; then if they fight you, there, slay them, there (a variant reading drops the alif in the three verbs [sc. wa-l taqtilhum, hatt yaqtulkum, fa-in qatalkum, so that the sense is \u0060slaying\u0027 in all three, and not just \u0060fighting\u0027]) -- such, killing and expulsion, is the requital of disbelievers.",
  "But if they desist, from unbelief and become Muslims, surely God is Forgiving, Merciful, to them.",
  "Fight them till there is no sedition, no idolatry, and the religion, all worship, is for God, alone and none are worshipped apart from Him; then if they desist, from idolatry, do not aggress against them. This is indicated by the following words, there shall be no enmity, no aggression through slaying or otherwise, save against evildoers. Those that desist, however, are not evildoers and should not be shown any enmity.",
  "The sacred month, in return, for the sacred month, therefore, just as they fight you during it, kill them during it: a response to the Muslims\u0027 consideration of the momentous nature of this matter; holy things (hurumt, plural of hurma, is what must be treated as sacrosanct) demand retaliation, in kind if these [holy things] are violated; whoever commits aggression against you, through fighting in the Sacred Enclosure, or during a state of ritual purity or in the sacred months, then commit aggression against him in the manner that he committed against you, the [Muslim] response is also referred to as \u0060aggression\u0027, because that is what it resembles formally; and fear God, when avenging yourselves and [by] renouncing aggression, and know that God is with the God-fearing, helping and assisting [them].",
  "And spend in the way of God, in obedience to Him, in holy struggle and the like; and cast not your own hands, yourselves (the b\u0027 of bi-aydkum \u0060with your hands\u0027 is extra) into destruction, by withholding funds needed for the struggle or abandoning it altogether, because this will give your enemy the advantage over you; but be virtuous, by spending etc.; God loves the virtuous, that is, He rewards them.",
  "Fulfil the Pilgrimage and the Visitation to God, by completing them according to their due; but if you are prevented, from fulfilling them by an enemy, then [give] such offering as may be feasible, for you -- a sheep -- and do not shave your heads, that is, do not release yourselves from the state of pilgrimage inviolability, until the offering, mentioned, reaches its place, its place of sacrifice, that is, within the enclosure, according to al-Shfi\u0060; the sacrifice is then made with the intention of releasing oneself from the state of pilgrimage inviolability, and is divided among the needy, after which the head is shaved and the release is effected. If any of you is sick, or has an ailment of the head, such as lice or severe pains, and has thus shaved his head while in a state of pilgrimage inviolability, then, incumbent upon him is, a redemption by fast, for three days, or a voluntary almsgiving, consisting of three cubic measures of the principal food of the town for six needy persons, or a ritual sacrifice, that is, the slaughter of a sheep (aw, \u0060or\u0027, denotes freedom of choice). To this [last] has been added the [case of the] one who shaves his head without excuse because the requirement of redemption is most obvious in his case; but also [it is required in the case of] one that enjoys, without shaving, such things as scents, attire, or oils, be it with an excuse or without. When you are secure, knowing that the enemy has gone or is not present, then whoever enjoys the Visitation, having completed it and observed its ritual prohibitions, until the Pilgrimage, until he enters its ritual inviolability in the relevant months; let his offering be such as is feasible, for him, such as a sheep that he sacrifices after entering into the state of pilgrimage inviolability, ideally, on the Day of Sacrifice; or if he finds none, because there are none available, or because he does not have sufficient funds, then, incumbent upon him is, a fast of three days in the Pilgrimage, that is to say, in a state of pilgrimage inviolability. In such a case, he should enter into the state of pilgrimage inviolability before the seventh of Dh\u0027l-Hijja, but ideally before the sixth, because one is discouraged from fasting on the Day of \u0060Arafa. Moreover, he should not fast during these the days of tashrq, according to the sounder of two opinions attributed to al-Shfi\u0060. And of seven when you return, to your domicile, [be it] Mecca or any other; or when you have completed the rites of the Pilgrimage\u0027 (there is a shift from the third [to the second] person); that is a full ten (this sentence reaffirms what has just been said); that, mentioned stipulation regarding the incumbency of the offering or the fast upon the person that has enjoyed [the Visitation], is for him whose family are not present at the Sacred Mosque, so that they are not within 50 miles of the Sacred Enclosure, according to al-Shfi\u0060. If they are [present however], then no blood [sacrifice] or fast is obligatory in his case, even if he has enjoyed [the Visitation]. The mention of \u0060family\u0027 is intended as a notification of the proviso in the case of being \u0060domiciled\u0027 [in the vicinity of the Sacred Mosque]. If one were to take up [temporary] residence, but not be domiciled, before the months of the Pilgrimage and enjoy the Visitation, then that [fast or sacrifice] will be incumbent upon him; this is one of two opinions of al-Shfi\u0060, the other being that it is not [incumbent]. The term ahl, \u0060family\u0027, is said to denote \u0060oneself\u0027. In the Sunna, in addition to the one that enjoys the Visitation, as mentioned, there is also the one that enters into the state of pilgrimage inviolability for both the Visitation and the Pilgrimage together [sc. qrin, \u0060one who combines\u0027] or in the case where the Pilgrimage encroaches upon [a Visitation], but before circumambulation [has been performed]. And fear God, in what He commands you and prohibits you; and know that God is severe in retribution, against whoever opposes Him.",
  "The Pilgrimage, the time for it, is in months well-known: Shawwl, Dh\u0027l-Qa\u0027da and ten nights, some say all, of Dh\u0027l Hijja; whoever undertakes, upon himself, the duty of Pilgrimage during them, by entering into the state of pilgrimage inviolability, then no lewdness, [no] sexual intercourse for them, nor wickedness, [nor] acts of disobedience, or disputing, [or] quarrelling, in the Pilgrimage (a variant reading [for fa-l rafathun wa-l fusqun wa-l jidla] has the accusative for all three nouns [sc. fa-l rafatha wa-l fusqa wa-l jidla]; prohibition is meant in all three cases). Whatever good you do, by way of voluntary almsgiving, God knows it, and will reward you for it. And take provision, to suffice you your journey: this was revealed regarding the people of Yemen, who use to make the Pilgrimage and not take any provisions with them, thus, becoming a burden for others. But the best provision is piety [taqw, \u0060piety\u0027, literally \u0060guarding\u0027] with which you are able to guard against asking others [for things]; and fear you Me, O people of pith!, [O] possessors of intellect.",
  "You would not be at fault if you should seek bounty, sustenance, from your Lord, by engaging in commerce at the Pilgrimage: this was revealed in response to their aversion to such an idea; but when you press on, push on, from \u0060Araft, having stood [in prayer] upon it, then remember God, after the overnight stay at Muzdalifa, by repeating the talbiya [sc. labbayka Llhumm labbayk, \u0060at thy service, O God, at thy service\u0027], the tahll [l ilha ill Llh, \u0060no god but God\u0027] and making supplications, at the Sacred Waymark, a mountain at the end of Muzdalifa, called Quzah. In one hadth, the Prophet (s) stood there remembering God and supplicating until his face began to glow brightly, according to Muslim; and remember Him as He has guided you, to the principal rites of His religion and the rituals of His Pilgrimage (the kf of ka-m, \u0060as\u0027, is the particle denoting the reason), though previously, before His guidance, you were astray.",
  "Then (thumma denotes the sequence intended) press on, O Quraysh, from where the people press on, that is, from \u0060Arafa, by standing there together with them (for, they used to stand at Muzdalifa, disdaining to stand with other people); and seek God\u0027s forgiveness, for your sins; God is Forgiving, Merciful, to the believers.",
  "And when you have performed, and completed, your holy rites, that is, the devotions pertaining to your pilgrimage, having cast [stones] at the Jamrat al-\u0060Aqaba, performed the circumambulation and stopped at Min, remember God, by extolling Him and repeating the takbr [saying Allhu akbar, \u0060God is Great\u0027], as you remember your fathers, as you used to remember them and boast about them at the end of your pilgrimage, or yet more intensely, than your remembrance of them (ashadda is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to dhikr \u0060remembrance\u0027, which itself is in the accusative as the object of udhkur, \u0060remember\u0027, because had it come after it, it would have functioned as an adjectival phrase). There are some people who say, \u0060Our Lord, give to us, our lot, in this world\u0027, and they are given it; such people will have no part, no lot, in the Hereafter.",
  "And there are others who say, \u0060Our Lord, give to us in this world good, a grace, and good, Paradise, in the Hereafter, and guard us against the chastisement of the Fire\u0027, by not making us enter it. This [former statement] depicts the manner of the idolaters, while [the latter] the way of the believers, and is intended to encourage [people] to petition for good in both abodes, for which one is promised a reward, as He says:",
  "Those -- they shall have a portion, a reward, from, as a result of, what they have earned, the deeds they have performed, such as Pilgrimage and supplication; and God is swift at reckoning, reckoning with the whole of creation in half a day of this world, as one hadth states.",
  "And remember God, by making takbr [saying Allhu akbar, \u0060God is Great\u0027] while you cast your stones at the Jamart, during certain days numbered, the three days of tashrq. If any man hastens on, his departure from Min, in two days, that is, on the second day of tashrq after he has cast his stones, that, hastening, is no sin for him; and if he delays, such that he stays until the third night and cast his stones, it is not a sin for him: that is, they have the choice of either, for the sin has been precluded in both cases; if he fears, God during his pilgrimage -- for such [a person] is truly a pilgrim -- and fear God, and know that to Him you shall be gathered, in the Hereafter, that He may requite you for your deeds.",
  "And among people there is he whose speech in the life of this world pleases you, but it would not please you in the Hereafter because it contradicts what he actually used to believe; and who calls on God to witness what is in his heart, as being in accordance with what he says; yet he is most stubborn in dispute, with you and your followers on account of his enmity towards you: this was al-Akhnas b. Sharq, a hypocrite who spoke kindly in the presence of the Prophet (s), swearing that he believed in him and that he loved him, and frequently sitting with him. God then revealed his mendacity in this matter. On one occasion he passed by some crops and livestock that belonged to the Muslims and later that night he set fire to them [the crops] and slaughtered them [the livestock]. God, moreover, says:",
  "And when he turns his back, leaving you behind, he hastens, he walks, about the earth to do corruption there and to destroy the tillage and the stock (these [last two actions] are included in such \u0060corruption\u0027); and God loves not corruption, that is to say, it does not please Him.",
  "And when it is said to him, \u0060Fear God\u0027, in your actions, he is seized by vainglory, pride and rage, in his sin, the one he was commanded to avoid committing. So Hell shall be enough, [it] suffices, for him -- how evil a cradling, a resting place it is!",
  "But there are other men who sell themselves, expend themselves in obedience to God, desiring God\u0027s pleasure: this was Suhayb [b. Sinn al-Rm], who emigrated to Medina when the idolaters began to persecute him, leaving them all his property; and God is Gentle with His servants, for He guides them to what pleases Him.",
  "The following verse was revealed regarding \u0060Abd Allh b. Salm and his companions, who after converting to Islam still observed the Sabbath with reverence and were averse to [the consumption of] camels: O you who believe, come, all of you, into submission (read al-salm or al-silm), that is, Islam; kffatan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-silm, meaning, into all of its precepts; and follow not the steps, the ways, of Satan, that is, his temptations to you by way of creating divisions; he is a manifest foe to you, one whose enmity is obvious.",
  "But if you slip, and incline away from implementing all of its precepts, after the clear proofs, the lucid arguments, have come to you, to the effect that this is the truth, know then that God is Mighty, and nothing can prevent Him from taking His vengeance against you; Wise, in His actions.",
  "What do they, those that fail to enter into it [sc. Islam] completely, wait for, await, that God shall come to them, that is, His Command; this is similar to where God says, or that God\u0027s command should come to pass [Q. 16:33], meaning His chastisement, in the shadows (zulal, plural of zulla) of clouds, and the angels? The matter is determined, the matter of their destruction has been completed, and to God all matters are returned, in the Hereafter, where He will requite each according to his deeds (read passive [turja\u0060u al-umr, \u0060matters are returned\u0027] or active [tarji\u0060u al-umr, \u0060matters return\u0027]).",
  "Ask, O Muhammad (s), the Children of Israel, by way of rebuke, how many a clear proof, manifest ones such as the parting of the sea, and the sending down of manna and quails, which they exchanged for unbelief, did We give them (kam, \u0060how many\u0027, is the interrogative particle linking the second object of the verb sal, \u0060ask\u0027, and is also the second object of the verb tayn, \u0060We gave\u0027, and its specifier); whoever changes God\u0027s grace, that is, what God has blessed him with in the way of signs, for these constitute the causes of guidance, after it has come to him, out of unbelief, God is severe in retribution against him.",
  "Decked out fair to the disbelievers, of Mecca, is the life of this world, in disguise and they have fallen in love with it; and they deride the believers, on account of their poverty, the likes of Bill [al-Habash], \u0060Ammr [b. Ysir], and Suhayb [al-Rm], mocking them and treating them condescendingly with their wealth; but those who fear, idolatry, namely, those mentioned, shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection; and God sustains whomever He will without reckoning, with ample sustenance in the Hereafter or in this world, when He gives to those that were mocked possession of the property and lives of those that mocked them.",
  "People were one community, in faith, but they fell into disagreement, and some believed, while others disbelieved; then God sent forth the prophets, to them, as bearers of good tidings, of Paradise for the believers, and warners, of the Fire for the disbelievers; and He revealed with them the Scripture, meaning, the Books, with the truth (bi\u0027l-haqqi, \u0060with the truth\u0027, is semantically connected to anzala, \u0060He revealed\u0027) that He might decide, according to it, between people regarding their differences, in religion; and only those who had been given it, the Scripture, so that some believed while others disbelieved, differed about it, [about] religion, after the clear proofs, the manifest arguments for God\u0027s Oneness, had come to them (min [of min ba\u0060di, \u0060after\u0027] is semantically connected to ikhtalafa, \u0060they differed\u0027, and together with what follows should be understood as coming before the exception [ill lladhna, \u0060only those\u0027]); out of insolence, on the part of the disbelievers, one to another; then God guided those who believed to the truth, regarding which (min [of min al-haqqi, \u0060of the truth\u0027] here is explicative) they were at variance, by His leave, by His will; and God guides, with His guidance, whomever He will to a straight path, the path of truth.",
  "The following was revealed after the Muslims suffered a trying experience: Or did you suppose that you should enter Paradise without there having come upon you the like of, what came upon, those, believers, who passed away before you?, of trials, so that you may endure as they did; a new sentence begins here, explaining the previous one: They were afflicted by misery, extreme poverty, and hardship, illness, and were so convulsed, by all types of tribulations, that the Messenger and those who believed with him said (read yaqla or yaqlu), not expecting to see any help, on account of the extreme hardship afflicting them, \u0060When will God\u0027s help come?\u0027, [the help] which we were promised; and God responded to them: Ah, but surely God\u0027s help is nigh, in coming.",
  "They will ask you, O Muhammad (s), about what they should expend. This was the question posed by \u0060Amr b. al-Jamh. He was a wealthy elderly man and went to ask the Prophet (s) what and for whom he should expend; Say, to them: \u0060Whatever you expend of good (min khayrin, \u0060of good\u0027, is an explication of m, \u0060whatever\u0027, covering small and large amounts, and denotes one half of the question represented by the expender; God responds with regard to the one receiving the expenditure, this pertaining to the other half of the question, in the following) it is for parents and kinsmen, orphans, the needy, and the traveller, that is, they are the most deserving of it; and whatever good you may do, by way of expending or otherwise, God has knowledge of it\u0027, and will requite it accordingly.",
  "Prescribed for you, obligatory [for you], is fighting, disbelievers, though it be hateful to you, by nature, because of the hardship involved. Yet it may happen that you hate a thing which is good for you; and it may happen that you love a thing which is bad for you: because the soul inclines towards those desires which result in its destruction and its rejection of the religious obligations that would bring about its happiness. Perhaps, then, even if you are averse to it, you will find much good in fighting, as a result of victory, booty, martyrdom or reward; while, if you were to reject fighting, even if you would like to do so, you will find much evil, because then you may be subjugated, impoverished and denied the reward; God knows, what is good for you, and you know, this, not, so strive in what He commands you.",
  "Thus the Prophet (s) sent forth the first of his raiding parties under the command of \u0060Abd Allh b. Jahsh. They fought against the idolaters and killed [\u0060Amr b. \u0060Abd Allh] Ibn al-Hadram in [the sacred month of] Rajab, thinking that it was the last day of Jumd II. The disbelievers reviled them for making fighting lawful in a sacred month, and so God revealed the following: They ask you about the sacred, the forbidden, month, and fighting in it (qitlin fhi, \u0060fighting in it\u0027, is an inclusive substitution [for al-shahri l-harmi, \u0060the sacred month\u0027]). Say, to them: \u0060Fighting (qitlun is the subject) in it is a grave thing (kabr, \u0060grave\u0027, is the predicate), that is, heinous in terms of sin; but to bar (saddun is the subject), people, from God\u0027s way, His religion, and disbelief in Him, in God, and, to bar from, the Sacred Mosque, that is, Mecca, and to expel its people, the Prophet (s) and the believers, from it -- that is graver (the predicate of the [last] subject), [that is] more heinous in terms of sin than fighting in it, in God\u0027s sight; and sedition, your idolatry, is graver than, your, slaying\u0027, in it. They, the disbelievers, will not cease to fight against you, O believers, until, so that, they turn you from your religion, to unbelief, if they are able; and whoever of you turns from his religion, and dies disbelieving -- their, good, works have failed, that is, they are invalid, in this world and the Hereafter. Thus they will not count for anything and will not result in any reward. The specification of death as a condition is because if that person were to return to Islam [again], his original deeds would not be invalidated, and he will be rewarded for them, and he would not have to repeat them, [deeds] such as [performing] the Pilgrimage: al-Shfi\u0060 is of this opinion. Those are the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding therein.",
  "When those of the raiding party [of \u0060Abd Allh b. Jahsh] thought that, although they had been released from the sin [of having slain in the sacred month], they would not receive any reward, the following was revealed: Verily the believers, and those who emigrate, and depart from their homeland, and struggle in God\u0027s way, in order to elevate His religion -- those have hope of God\u0027s compassion, His reward; and God is Forgiving, of believers, Merciful, to them.",
  "They ask you about wine, and divinatory arrows, gambling, and what the ruling is regarding them. Say, to them: \u0060In both, that is, in the partaking of both, is great sin (a variant reading [for kabr, \u0060great\u0027] has kathr, \u0060much\u0027) because of the fighting, cursing and swearing that ensue from it; and profit for men, by way of delight and enjoyment in wine, and acquiring money effortlessly from gambling; but the sin in them, that is, the degenerate behaviour in which they result, is greater, graver, than the usefulness\u0027. When this verse was revealed, some gave up drinking, while others persisted, until the verse of srat al-M\u0027ida [Q. 5:90-91] finally made it illicit. And they will ask you what, that is to say, how much, they should expend. Say, expend, \u0060Comfortably\u0027 (al-\u0060afwa [in the accusative] is also read in the nominative, al-\u0060afwu, implying a preceding huwa), that is, the surplus of your need, and do not expend what you need, ruining yourselves. So, just as He explained to you what has been mentioned, God makes clear His signs to you that you might reflect,",
  "on, the matters of, this world and the Hereafter, and follow what is best for you in both. They will ask you about orphans, and the distress their affair caused them, for, if they became intimate with them, they may slip into error, but if they put aside the money due to them and prepare their meals for them separately, this would distress them. Say: \u0060To set their affairs aright, in terms of their funds, by looking after it, and your mingling with them, is better\u0027, than you not doing this; and if you intermix with them, your funds and theirs, they are your brothers, in religion and it is only natural for one to intermix his affair with his brother, so you do too; God knows well him who works corruption, in their property when he intermixes with them, from him who sets, it, aright, and God will requite both; and had He willed He would have harassed you, and made it difficult for you by prohibiting you from intermixing with them. Surely God is Mighty, victorious in His affair, Wise, in His actions.",
  "O Muslims, Do not marry idolatresses, disbelievers, until they believe; a believing slavegirl is better than an idolatress, who may be a free woman; this was revealed as a rebuttal of the idea that it was shameful to marry a slavegirl and that it was better to marry an idolatress free woman; though you may admire her, because of her beauty and wealth: this provision excludes the womenfolk of the People of the Scripture (as indicated by the verse [Q. 5:5], [lawful to you] are the chaste women among those who were given the Scripture). And do not marry, off believing women to, idolaters, until they believe. A believing slave is better than an idolater, though you may admire him, for his wealth and good looks. Those, the people of idolatry, call to the Fire, because they invite one to perform deeds that merit this, and for this reason one should not marry with them; and God calls, through the voice of His prophets, to Paradise and pardon, that is, to the deeds that merit these two, by His leave, by His will, so that His call may be heeded by marrying with His friends; and He makes clear His signs to the people so that they might remember, [that] they [might] be admonished.",
  "They will ask you about the monthly period, that is, menstruation and the spot in which it occurs, and how should one treat women during it. Say: \u0060It is an ailment, filth, or the place whence it issues is so; so part with women, refrain from sexual intercourse with them, in the monthly period, in this time, or in the part affected; and do not approach them, for sexual intercourse, until they are pure (yathurna, or yattahharna: the original t\u0027 [of yatatahharna] has been assimilated with the t\u0027), that is, until they have cleansed themselves after its cessation; when they have cleansed themselves, then come to them, in sexual intercourse, as God has commanded you\u0027, by avoiding it, the female organ, during menstruation and not resorting to any other part. Truly, God loves, that is, He rewards and honours, those who repent, of sins, and He loves those who cleanse themselves, from impurities.",
  "Your women are a tillage for you, that is, the place where you sow [the seeds of] your children; so come to your tillage, that is, the specified place, the front part, as, in whichever way, you wish, whether standing up, sitting down, lying down, from the front or the back: this was revealed in response to the Jews saying that if a person had vaginal intercourse with his wife from behind, the child would be born cross-eyed; and offer for your souls, righteous deeds, such as saying, \u0060In the Name of God\u0027 (bismillh) when you commence intercourse; and fear God, in what He commands and prohibits; and know that you shall meet Him, at the Resurrection, where He will requite you according to your deeds; and give good tidings, of Paradise, to the believers, who feared Him.",
  "Do not make God, by swearing in His Name, a hindrance, a cause of impediment, in your oaths, that is, setting up [such impediments] by swearing in His Name frequently, so as not, to be pious and God-fearing; in such instances oaths are hateful, and result in perjury, which requires a redemption, effected by doing the opposite [of the oath], such as performing righteous deeds and so forth, which constitute an act of obedience; and to put things right between people: this means, do not be prevented from doing righteous deeds, as mentioned, just because you swore against them; nay, do them and make redemption; [this understanding of the verse is] justified by the reason for its revelation, namely, their refraining from such deeds; surely God is All-Hearing, of what you say, Knower, of your circumstances.",
  "God will not take you to task for a slip, that results, in your oaths, which is what the tongue utters spontaneously and unintentionally, such as \u0060By God\u0027, \u0060Indeed, by God\u0027: in such instances there is no sin and no redemption required; but He will take you to task for what your hearts have earned, what their intention is, when you commit perjury in your oaths; and God is Forgiving, of slips [in your oaths], Forbearing, since He delays the punishment of the one deserving it.",
  "For those who forswear their women, by swearing that they will not have sexual intercourse with them, a wait of four months; if they revert, back from the oath, or repeal it and resume sexual relations, God is Forgiving, of the harm they caused their women by swearing, Merciful, to them.",
  "But if they resolve upon divorce, by not repealing it, then let them go through with it; surely God is Hearing, of what they say; Knowing, of their resolve, meaning that after the waiting period mentioned, they can only revert or divorce.",
  "Divorced women shall wait by themselves, before remarrying, for three periods (qur\u0027in is the plural of qar\u0027), of purity or menstruation -- these are two different opinions -- which begin from the moment of divorce. This [stipulation] applies to those who have been sexually penetrated but not to those otherwise, on account of His saying, there shall be no [waiting] period for you to reckon against them [Q. 33:49]. The waiting period for immature or menopausal women is three months; pregnant women, on the other hand, must wait until they give birth, as stated in the srat al-Talq [Q. 65:4], while slavegirls must wait two months, according to the Sunna. And it is not lawful for them to hide what God has created in their wombs, of child or menstruation, if they believe in God and the Last Day. Their mates, their spouses, have a better right to restore them, to bring them back, even if they refuse, in such time, that is, during the waiting period, if they desire to set things right, between them, and put pressure on the woman [to return]; the statement is not a condition for the possibility of return, but an incitement [to set things right] in the case of repealed divorce; the term ahaqq, \u0060better right to\u0027, does not denote any priority, since, in any case, no other person has the right to marry them during their waiting period; women shall have rights, due from their spouses, similar to those, rights, due from them, with justice, as stipulated by the Law, in the way of kind conjugality and not being harmed; but their men have a degree above them, in rights, as in their duty to obey their husbands, because of their [the husbands\u0027] payment of a dowry and their [husbands] being the bread-winners; God is Mighty, in His Kingdom, Wise, in what He has ordained for His creatures.",
  "Divorce, that is, repudiation of the type that may be revoked, is twice; then honourable retention, that is to say, you are then obliged to revert to them to retain them, without harming them; or setting, them, free kindly. It is not lawful for you, O male spouses, to take of what you have given them, of dowry, if you divorce them, unless the, married, couple fear that they may not maintain God\u0027s bounds, that is to say, that they will not honour the rights God has established for them (a variant reading [for yakhf, \u0060they (dual form) fear\u0027] has yukhf, with the direct object taking the accusative ending; all yuqm is an inclusive substitution for the person [governing the verb]; both verbs are also read in the second person [sc. takhf, \u0060you fear\u0027, tuqm, \u0060you maintain\u0027]). If you fear they may not maintain God\u0027s bounds, neither of them would be at fault if she were to ransom herself, of some money, so that he should divorce her. In other words, in this instance, there is no culpability either for the man, should he take of the dowry, or for the woman, should she offer of it. Those, prescriptions mentioned, are God\u0027s bounds; do not transgress them. Whoever transgresses God\u0027s bounds -- those are the evildoers.",
  "If he, the husband, divorces her, after the two utterances [of divorce]; she shall not be lawful to him after that, after the third [utterance of] divorce, until she marries another husband, who has sexual intercourse with her, as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim]. If he, the second husband, divorces her, then neither of them would be at fault, that is, the woman and her first husband, to return to each other, in wedlock, after the completion of the waiting period, if they think that they will maintain God\u0027s bounds. Those, matters mentioned, are God\u0027s bounds, which He makes clear to a people who have knowledge, [a people who] reflect.",
  "When you divorce women, and they have, very nearly, reached, the end of, their term, then retain them, by returning to them, honourably, not harming them, or set them free honourably, or leave them until their term is completed; do not retain them, when reverting, in harm (dirran is an object denoting reason), to transgress, that is, so as to force them to redemption, or to repudiate them or confine them indoors for a long time; whoever does that has wronged his soul, by exposing it to God\u0027s chastisement; take not God\u0027s verses in mockery, in jest by contravening them, and remember God\u0027s grace upon you, that is, Islam, and the Book, the Qur\u0027n, and the wisdom, the rulings contained therein, He has revealed to you, to exhort you therewith, so that you should give thanks by acting in accordance with it; and fear God, and know that God has knowledge of all things, and nothing can be hidden from Him.",
  "When you divorce women, and they have reached, completed, their term, of waiting, do not debar them -- addressing the guardians here -- from marrying their, divorced, husbands when they, the male spouses and their women, have agreed together honourably, in accordance with the Law. The occasion for the revelation [of this verse] was: Ma\u0060qil b. Yasr\u0027s sister was divorced by her husband, who then wanted to restore her, but Ma\u0060qil refused, as reported by al-Hkim. That, the prohibition against debarring, is an admonition for whoever of you believe in God and the Last Day, because it is for the benefit of such a person; that, refraining from debarring, is purer for you, better, and cleaner, for you and for them, bearing in mind the suspicion that can be aroused by the couple on account of prior intimacy. God knows, what is in your interest, and you know not, any of this, so follow His commands.",
  "Mothers, shall, suckle their children for two full years (kmilayn, \u0060two full ones\u0027, is an adjective for emphasis); this is, for such as desire to fulfil the suckling, and this is the maximum length of time. It is for the father to provide, food for, them, the mothers, and clothe them, during the suckling if they be divorced, honourably, to the best of his ability. No soul is charged save to its capacity, its ability; a mother shall not be harmed by her child, that is, on account of the child, by being forced to suckle it, if she does not want to; neither, should, a father, be harmed, by his child, that is, on account of it, by being charged with more than he is able to bear. The mention of both parents here in relation to the child is intended to show sympathy [for both]. The heir, the one inheriting from his father, that is, the young man who is the trustee of his [father\u0027s] property, has a similar duty, to that of the father in terms of providing sustenance and clothing for the [other] parent. But if the two, parents, desire by mutual consent, agreement, and consultation, so that the child\u0027s best interests are clear, to wean, that is, to effect ablactation before the completion of the two- year period, then they would not be at fault, in this matter. And if you (addressing the parents) desire to seek nursing, from other than the mothers, for your children, you would not be at fault, in this respect, provided you hand over, to them, what you have given, what you intend to give them in the way of wages, honourably, in kindness and good nature; and fear God, and know that God sees what you do, and that nothing of it can be hidden from Him.",
  "And those of you who pass away, die, leaving, behind, wives, they shall wait by themselves, after their death, refraining from marriage, for four months and ten, nights: this applies to women who are not pregnant. The waiting period in the case of pregnant women is for them to give birth -- as stated by a verse in srat al-Talq [Q. 65:4]. The slavegirl must wait for half this period [of four months] according to the Sunna; when they have reached, completed, their term, of waiting, then you would not be at fault, O guardians, regarding what they may do with themselves, in the way of adorning themselves and offering themselves before suitors, honourably, in accordance with the Law; God is aware of what you do, both secretly and openly.",
  "You would not be at fault regarding the proposal, with the intention of marriage, you present, offer, or hide in your hearts, during the waiting period, to women, whose spouses have died: such as men saying, \u0060How beautiful you are!\u0027, or, \u0060Who could find one like you?\u0027, or \u0060How many a man must desire you!\u0027. God knows that you will be mindful of them, in proposing to them impatiently, and so He has permitted you to make such offers; but do not make arrangements, of marriage, with them secretly, unless you speak honourable words, such as are acknowledged by the Law, in other words, such as proposals, that which is permitted to you. And do not resolve on the knot, the consummation, of marriage until that which is written, the period prescribed, has reached its term, and has been completed; and know that God knows what is in your souls, of resolve or otherwise; so be fearful of Him, that He should chastise you if you have made such resolve; and know that God is Forgiving, toward him who is fearful of Him, Forbearing, in delaying the chastisement of the one deserving it.",
  "You would not be at fault if you divorce women while you have not touched them (tamasshunna: also read tumsshunna), that is, [while] you have not had sexual intercourse with them, nor appointed any obligation, dowry, for them (the particle m, \u0060while\u0027, relates to the verbal action and is also adverbial) that is to say, there are no sinful consequences for divorcing them if you have not copulated with them or assigned them a dowry, so divorce them; yet make provision of comforts for them honourably, that is, in accordance with the Law (bi\u0027l-ma\u0060rf, \u0060honourably\u0027, is an adjectival qualification of mat\u0060an, \u0060comforts\u0027), giving them what they can enjoy, the one of ample means, the affluent among you, according to his means, and the needy man, of restricted income, according to his means -- an obligation (haqqan, \u0060obligation\u0027, is either a second qualifier of mat\u0060an, \u0060comforts\u0027, or an emphatic verbal noun), on the virtuous, the obedient ones.",
  "And if you divorce them before you have touched them, and you have already appointed for them an obligation, then one-half of what you have appointed, must be given to them and the other half returns to you; unless it be that they, the women, make remission, and forgo it, or he makes remission, by leaving her the entire amount, the one in whose hand is the knot of marriage, the husband to be, or as Ibn \u0060Abbs is reported to have said, \u0060The legal guardian, where the female is a minor\u0027; in which case nobody would be at fault; yet that you should remit (wa-an ta\u0060f is the subject) is nearer to piety (aqrabu li\u0027l-taqw is its predicate). Forget not kindness between you, that is, to be bountiful towards one another; surely God sees what you do, and will requite you accordingly.",
  "Maintain the, five, prayers, by performing them at their appointed times, and the middle prayer, either that of the afternoon, or the morning, or the midday, or another prayer (there are many opinions on this matter); God has singled it out for mention because of its merit; and stand, in prayer, submissive to God, li Lllhi qnitn: some have said that this means \u0060obedience\u0027, on account of the Prophet (s) saying, \u0060Wherever the [expression] qunt [\u0060submission\u0027], appears in the Qur\u0027n, it denotes obedience\u0027, as reported by Ahmad [b. Hanbal] and others; it is also said to mean \u0060in silence\u0027 [skitn], on the basis of a hadth of Zayd b. Arqam, in which he said, \u0060We used to speak to each other sometimes during prayer, but when this was revealed, we were commanded to be silent and were forbidden to talk\u0027, as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim].",
  "And if you are in fear, of an enemy, or a torrent, or a predatory animal, then standing (rijl, plural of rjil), praying while walking, or mounted (rukbn, plural of rkib). In other words, in whichever way you can, facing the direction of the qibla or otherwise, making the gestures of genuflexion and prostration; but when you are secure, from any fear, then remember God, by performing prayer, as He taught you what you knew not, before He taught you its obligations and its proper ways (the particle kf [of ka-m, \u0060as\u0027] has the same meaning as mithl [\u0060like\u0027], while the m is related to the verbal action, or is relative).",
  "And those of you who die, leaving wives, let them, make testament (wasiyyatan, or wasiyyatun) for their wives, as an obligation, and give them provision, what they can enjoy of property and clothes, for, until the completion of, a year (mat\u0060an il l-hawl, \u0060provision for a year\u0027, is a circumstantial qualifier), that is, without expelling them from their habitations; but if they go forth, of their own accord, you would not be at fault, [you] the guardians of the dead one, regarding what they may do with themselves honourably, in accordance with the Law, such as adorning themselves or abandoning the mourning, or that you should cut off their expenditure; God is Mighty, in His Kingdom, Wise, in His actions. The testament mentioned here was abrogated by the \u0060inheritance\u0027 verse [Q. 4:12], and the waiting of one year [without expulsion] was abrogated by the previous verse four months and ten [Q. 2:234] which was revealed later. In the opinion of al-Shfi\u0060, may God have mercy on him, the habitation remains hers.",
  "There shall be provision for divorced women, which they are given, honourably, as is feasible -- an obligation (haqqan, \u0060obligation\u0027, is in the accusative because it is governed by an implied verb) on those who fear God, may He be exalted. He has repeated the phrase in order to include the woman that has been touched [sexually], since the previous verse addresses a different issue.",
  "So, in the same way that He has explained to you what has been mentioned, God makes clear His signs for you, so that you might understand, reflect.",
  "Have you not seen (an interrogative to provoke amazement and a longing to hear what will follow), that is, \u0060Has your knowledge not attained\u0027, those thousands, four, eight, ten, thirty, forty or seventy thousand, who went forth from their habitations fearful of death? (hadhara\u0027l-mawt: an object denoting reason). These were a people from among the Children of Israel who fled their homeland after it was afflicted with plague. God said to them, \u0060Die!\u0027, and they did. Then He gave them life, after eight days or more, as a result of the supplication of their prophet Ezekiel (Hizql), and they lived on for a while with the effects of death still upon them, such that when they wore garments these turned into shrouds for the deceased; and this [phenomenon] remained with their descendants. Truly God is bounteous to people, such as when He gave life back to those just mentioned, but most people, that is, disbelievers, are not thankful. The purpose of mentioning the story of these people is to encourage believers to fight [in the way of God], which is why the following [statement] is supplemented to it:",
  "So fight in God\u0027s way, in order to elevate His religion, and know that God is Hearing, of your sayings, Knowing, of your affairs, and He will requite you accordingly.",
  "Who is he that will lend God a loan, by expending his property in the way of God, that is good, by expending it for the sake of God, Mighty and Majestic, out of pureness of heart, and He will multiply (yud\u0060if, also read yuda\u0060\u0060if) it for him manifold?, up to ten or seven hundred times or more, as will be mentioned soon. God straitens, sustenance for whomever He wills in order to try him, and enlarges, it in abundance for whomever He wills in order to test him; and to Him you shall be returned, in the Hereafter through the Resurrection, where He will requite you for your deeds.",
  "Have you not seen, the story and the tale of, the council, an assembly, of the Children of Israel, after, the death of, Moses, when they said to a prophet of theirs, namely, Samuel, \u0060Send, establish, for us a king, to unite us and to whom we can refer [matters], and we will fight, with him, in God\u0027s way\u0027. He, the prophet, said, to them: \u0060Might it be that (\u0060asaytum, or \u0060astum) if fighting is prescribed for you, you will not fight? (all tuqtil is the predicate of \u0060as, \u0060might it be\u0027; the interrogative is intended to confirm the expectation that follows [sc. that they will not fight]). They said, \u0060Why should we not fight in God\u0027s way, when we have been expelled from our habitations and our children?\u0027, as a result of these latter being taken captive or killed, that which they suffered at the hands of Goliath and his men. The meaning is, \u0060There is nothing to stop us fighting, provided the requirement [we demanded] is forthcoming\u0027. God, exalted be He, says, Yet when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned their backs, from fighting in cowardice, except a few of them, the ones that crossed the river with Saul (Tlt), as will be mentioned; and God has knowledge of the evildoers, and will requite them accordingly. The prophet then asked his Lord to send forth a king, and God responded by sending forth Saul.",
  "Then their prophet said to them, \u0060Verily God has raised up Saul for you as king\u0027 They said, \u0060How can he be king over us when we have better right than he to kingship, since he is not of the tribe of monarchs or that of prophets; he [Saul] was a tanner or a shepherd; seeing he has not been given amplitude of wealth?\u0027 which he can use to establish a kingdom. He, the prophet, said, to them, \u0060God has chosen him over you, for kingship, and has increased him broadly, amply, in knowledge and body: at that time, he was the most knowledgeable and the most handsome of all the Children of Israel, and the most perfect of character. God gives the kingship to whom He will, in the way He does, and there can be no objection; and God is Embracing, in His bounty, Knowing, of those who deserve it.",
  "And their prophet said to them, after they had demanded a sign of his kingship: \u0060The sign of his kingship is that there will come to you the Ark, a chest containing the images of the prophets, which God sent down to Adam, and which was handed down to them [sc. the Israelites], until the Amalekites seized it from them in battle. They used to commence fighting invoking it before their enemy and marching behind it, as well as experience peacefulness in its presence, as God says: therein is a Spirit of Peace, reassurance for your hearts, from your Lord, and a remnant of what the folk of Moses and the folk of Aaron left behind, which were Moses\u0027s pair of sandals and his staff, Aaron\u0027s turban, a measure (qafz) of the manna that used to come down on them, and the pieces of the broken tablets, the angels bearing it (tahmiluhu l-mal\u0027ikatu, the circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb ya\u0027tiyakum, \u0060there will come to\u0027). Surely in that shall be a sign for you, of his kingship, if you are believers\u0027. The angels bore it between the earth and the sky while they gazed at it, until finally they placed it before Saul. They then acknowledged his kingship and hastened to enlist in the [holy] struggle, and he chose seventy thousand of their young men.",
  "And when Saul went forth with the hosts, from the Holy House [sc. Jerusalem], the heat was intense and so they asked him for water; he said, \u0060God will try, test, you, in order to distinguish the obedient among you from the disobedient, with a river, between Jordan and Palestine, whoever drinks of it, of its water, is not of me, is not of my followers, and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except for him who scoops up with his hand\u0027 (ghurfa, or gharfa, \u0060a scoop\u0027), satisfying himself therewith and not taking more, he is also of my followers. But they drank of it, when they reached it and saw that it was abundant, except a few of them, who restricted themselves to a scoop: it is reported that one scoop was enough for each man and his horse, and they numbered over three hundred; and when he crossed it, with those who believed, the ones who confined themselves to the one scoop, they, the ones that drank profusely, said, \u0060We have no power today against Goliath and his troops\u0027, that is, [no power] to fight them, and they were cowardly and did not cross it. Those who thought, with certainty that, they would meet God, at the Resurrection, and these were the ones that crossed it, said, \u0060How often (kam, \u0060how\u0027, functions as a predicate, meaning kathr, \u0060many\u0027) a little company, group of men, has overcome a numerous one, by God\u0027s leave, by His will; and God is with the patient\u0027, [providing them] with help and assistance.",
  "So, when they went forth against Goliath and his troops, facing them in military columns, they said, \u0060Our Lord, pour out upon us patience, and make firm our feet, by strengthening our hearts for this struggle, and grant us victory over the disbelieving folk!\u0027",
  "And they routed, they broke, them, by the leave of God, by His will, and David, who was among the ranks of Saul\u0027s army, slew Goliath; and God gave him, David, the kingship, over the Children of Israel, and Wisdom, prophethood after the death of Samuel and Saul, and the combination [of kingship and prophethood] had never come to anyone before him; and He taught him such as He willed, of the manufacture of mail-coats and the speech of birds. Had God not repelled people some (ba\u0060dahum, \u0060some\u0027, substitutes for [saying] ba\u0060dan min al-ns, \u0060some people\u0027) by means of others the earth would have surely been corrupted, with idolaters defeating and slaying Muslims, and mosques being destroyed; but God is bounteous to all worlds, by repelling some by means of others.",
  "These, verses, are the verses of God We recite to you, O Muhammad (s), as narration, in truth, and assuredly you are one of the Messengers [of God], the emphasis is made here with the particle inna [of innaka, \u0060surely you are\u0027], with the remainder of the statement being a rebuttal of the disbelievers\u0027 saying, \u0060You are no Messenger\u0027.",
  "Those (tilka is the subject) messengers (al-rusul is either an adjective or the predicate) some We have preferred above others, by assigning a particular trait to one not found in the other; some there are to whom God spoke, such as Moses, and some He raised in rank, namely, Muhammad (s), on account of his call being to all peoples, his being the Seal of the Prophets, on account of the superiority of his community to all others, the sundry miracles and the many special qualities. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs, and confirmed him, strengthened him, with the Holy Spirit, namely, Gabriel who would accompany him wherever he went. And had God willed, that all people be guided, those who came after them, after the messengers, that is, their communities, would not have fought against one another after the clear proofs had come to them, because of their disagreement and their leading one another astray; but they fell into variance, as He willed, and some of them believed, and adhered firmly to his faith, and some disbelieved, as the Christians did after Jesus (al-Mash), and had God willed they would not have fought against one another (repeated here for emphasis), but God does whatever He desires, giving success to whomever He will and disappointment to whomever He will.",
  "O you who believe, expend of what We have provided you with, what is due of it as alms, before there comes a day in which there shall be neither commerce, ransom, nor friendship, that can be of any benefit, nor intercession, without His permission (a variant reading has all three nouns in nominative inflection bay\u0060un, khullatun, shaf\u0060atun [as opposed to l bay\u0060a, l khullata, l shaf\u0060ata]): this is the Day of Resurrection. And the disbelievers, those that disbelieve in God or in the obligations He has imposed on them -- they are the evildoers, for not respecting God\u0027s command.",
  "God, there is no god, that is, there is none worthy of being worshipped in [all] existence, except Him, the Living, the Everlasting, the Eternal Sustainer, the One constantly engaged in the management of His creation. Slumber does not seize Him, neither sleep; to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants; who is there, that is to say, none is there, that shall intercede with Him save by His leave?, in this for him. He knows what lies before them, that is, creation, and what is after them, of the affairs of this world and the Hereafter; and they encompass nothing of His knowledge, that is, they know nothing of what He knows, save such as He wills, to inform of it by way of His messengers. His throne subsumes the heavens and the earth, it is said that His knowledge encompasses them both; it is also said that the kurs (\u0060throne\u0027) itself subsumes them on account of its vastness, as in the hadth, \u0060The seven heavens compared to the kurs are like seven silver coins lying in a metal shield [of armour]\u0027; the preserving of them, the heavens and the earth, wearies Him not, does not burden Him; He is the Sublime, above His creation by virtue of His subjugation [of them], the Tremendous, the Great.",
  "There is no compulsion in, entering into, religion. Rectitude has become clear from error, that is say, through clear proofs it has become manifest that faith is rectitude and disbelief is error: this was revealed concerning the Ansr [of Medina] who tried to compel their sons to enter into Islam; so whoever disbelieves in the false deity, namely, Satan or idols (tght, \u0060false deity\u0027, is used in a singular and plural sense), and believes in God, has laid hold of the most firm handle, the tight knot, unbreaking, that cannot be severed; God is Hearing, of what is said, Knowing, of what is done.",
  "God is the Protector, helper, of the believers; He brings them forth from the shadows, of unbelief, into the light, of faith. And the disbelievers -- their protectors are false deities, that bring them forth from the light into the shadows: the repetition of \u0060bringing forth from\u0027 here is either to be taken as a reflection of His [previous] words, \u0022He brings them forth from the shadows\u0022, or as a reference to all those Jews who believed in the Prophet before he was sent, but then rejected him, those are the inhabitants of the Fire, therein they shall abide.",
  "Have you not seen him who disputed with Abraham, concerning his Lord, because of the fact, that God had given him the kingship?, that is, his arrogance towards this very grace of God: this was Nimrod (Nimrd). When (idh is a substitution for hjja, \u0060disputed\u0027) Abraham, in response to the other\u0027s question, \u0060Who is this Lord of yours to whom you are calling us?\u0027, said: \u0060My Lord is He who gives life, and makes to die\u0027, the One that creates life and death in bodies; he [Nimrod] said, \u0060I give life, by sparing, and make to die\u0027, by killing. He then had two men brought before him, killed one and spared the other. When Abraham realised that this man was a fool, Abraham, resorting to a more sophisticated argument, said: \u0060God brings the sun from the east; so bring, you, it from the west.\u0027 Then the disbeliever was confused, perplexed and amazed; and God guides not the folk who do evil, disbelieving, to the art of argument.",
  "Or, did you see, such as he, Ezra (\u0060Uzayr), who (the kf of ka\u0027lladh, \u0060such as he who\u0027, is extra) passed by a city, namely, the Holy House [sc. Jerusalem], riding on an ass and carrying with him a basket of figs and a cup of juice, [a city] that was fallen down, collapsed, upon its turrets, its roof tops: after Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed it; he said, \u0060How (ann means kayfa, \u0060how\u0027) shall God give life to this now that it is dead?\u0027, challenging the power of the exalted One, so God made him die, and remain dead for, a hundred years, then he raised him up, brought him back to life to show him how this could be done; He, God, said, \u0060How long have you tarried?\u0027, been here?; he said, \u0060I have tarried a day, or part of a day\u0027, because he fell asleep before noon, and was made dead and then brought back to life again at sunset, and thus he thought it was a day\u0027s sleep; He said, \u0060Nay; you have tarried a hundred years. Look at your food, the figs, and drink, the cup of juice, it has not spoiled, despite the length of time (the final h\u0027 of yatasannah, \u0060to spoil\u0027, is said to belong to the original root, s-n-h; but it is also said to be silent, in which case the root would be s-n-y; a variant reading omits the final h\u0027); and look at your ass, how it is, and he saw that it had died, and all that remained were its withered white bones. We did this so that you would know and, so that We would make you a sign, of [the truth of] the Resurrection, for the people. And look at the bones, of the ass, how We shall set them up, how We shall raise them back to life (nunshiruh, or nanshiruh, derived from the two expressions, nashara and anshara; a variant reading has nunshizuh, meaning \u0060How We shall move it and make it stand\u0027); and then clothe them with flesh\u0027, and when he looked at it, he saw that [the bones] had been reconstituted and clothed with flesh, and that the Spirit had been breathed into it, making it bray. So, when it was made clear to him, as a result of witnessing it, he said, \u0060I know (a variant reading for a\u0060lam, \u0060I know\u0027, has [the imperative] i\u0060lam, \u0060know!\u0027, thus making it a command from God), with the knowledge of direct vision, that God has power over all things\u0027.",
  "And, mention, when Abraham said, \u0060My Lord show me how You give life to the dead,\u0027 He, God, exalted be He, said, to him, \u0060Why, do you not believe?\u0027, in My power to revive; God asks him this even though He knows of his belief in this [power], as a response to his request, and so that the ones listening will know the purpose [of the request]; \u0060Yes,\u0027, I do believe, he said, \u0060but, I ask You, so that my heart may be re-assured\u0027, [so that it may be] at peace, through direct vision, in addition to that [certainty] which is sought through logical reasoning. Said He, \u0060Take four birds, and twist them to you (sirhunna, or surhunna), turn them towards you, cut them up and mix together their flesh and feathers, then set a part of them on every hill, in the land around you, then summon them, to you, and they will come to you in haste. And know that God is Mighty, that nothing is beyond Him, Wise\u0027, in His actions. Abraham took a peacock, an eagle, a raven and a cock and did with them as has been mentioned, but kept their heads with him. He called them, and all the parts began to fly back together, combining until they were whole and returning to their heads.",
  "The likeness, of the quality of the expenditure, of those who expend their wealth in the way of God, that is, in obedience of Him, is as the likeness of a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains: likewise what they expend will be multiplied seven hundred times; so God multiplies, even more than this, for whom He will; God is Embracing, in His bounty, Knowing, those who deserve such multiplications.",
  "Those who expend their wealth in the way of God then do not follow up their expenditure with reminder of their generosity, of the one on whom they expended, for example, by saying, \u0060I was good to him and restored his affairs\u0027; and injury, to that person, by mentioning this to people whom he would prefer not to know about it; their wage, the reward for their expenditure, is with their Lord, and no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve, in the Hereafter.",
  "Honourable words, kind talk and a generous reply to the beggar, and forgiveness, towards him for his persistence, are better than a voluntary almsgiving followed by injury, through reproach and deriding him for his begging; and God is Independent, of the voluntary almsgiving of His servants, Forbearing, in His delaying the punishment of the reproachful and injurious one.",
  "O you who believe, annul not, the rewards of, your voluntary almsgivings with reproach and injury, as, in the manner of the annulment of the expenditure of, one who expends of his substance to show off to men and believes not in God and the Last Day: this is the hypocrite. The likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil, and a torrent, of intense rain, smites it, and leaves it barren, and smooth with nothing on it. They have no power (l yaqdirna is a resumption of the statement about the likeness of the one that expends for show; the person becomes plural on account of the [potential plural] implication of alladh, \u0060the one who\u0027) over anything that they have earned, that they did, in other words, they find no reward for it in the Hereafter, just as one finds nothing of the dust that was on the surface of the smooth rock, after the rain has washed it away. God guides not the disbelieving folk.",
  "But the likeness, of the expenditure, of those who expend their wealth, seeking God\u0027s good pleasure, and to confirm themselves, that is, to realise the reward thereof, in contrast to the hypocrites who do not hope for it, since they do not believe in it, is as the likeness of a garden, an orchard, upon a hill, (read rabwa or rubwa) a high ground; a torrent smites it and it yields, gives forth, its produce (read ukulah or uklah), its fruits, twofold, twice the fruits of another [garden]; if no torrent smites it, then dew, (tall, a light drizzle) which falls on it and suffices it on account of its altitude. In other words, it grows and bears fruit, regardless of how much rain falls; likewise are the expenditures of those mentioned: they will increase with God, regardless of how much they were; and God sees what you do, and He will requite you for it.",
  "Would any of you wish to have a garden, an orchard, of date-palms and vines, with rivers flowing beneath it, for him there is in it all manner of fruit, then old age smites him, and makes him too weak to profit from it, and he has seed, but they are weak, young children who cannot manage it; then a whirlwind (i\u0060sr are violent winds) with fire smites it, and it is consumed?, so that he loses what he is most in need of, and now he and his children have become incapacitated, confused, without any resources. This is a similitude of how the expenditure of the one expending for show, or the one who reproaches [after having expended], vanishes and how it is of no avail when he will be most in need of it in the Hereafter (the interrogative [a- yawaddu, \u0060would any wish\u0027] is intended as a denial). According to Ibn \u0060Abbs, this is the person who performs deeds of obedience, but when Satan comes to him, he begins to work disobedience, until all his good deeds have been consumed. So, in the way that He has explained what has been mentioned, God makes clear the signs to you, so that you might reflect, and take heed.",
  "O you who believe, expend of, that is to say, purify, the good things you have earned, of property, and, the good things, of what We have produced for you from the earth, of grains and fruits, and seek not (l tayammam, means l taqsud) the corrupt, the vile, of it, the above-mentioned, for your expending, it as alms (tunfiqna, \u0060you expend\u0027, is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of [the verb] tayammam, \u0060seek\u0027); for you would never take it, the vile part, yourselves, if you were given it as something due to you; without closing your eyes to it, by being careless and mindless, so how do you expect to give what is due to God from this?; and know that God is Independent, of your expenditures, Laudable, praised in every situation.",
  "Satan promises you poverty, by making you fear [loss] when you make a voluntary almsgiving, and so you withhold it, and enjoins you to indecency, niggardliness and the impeding of almsgiving; but God promises you, in return for your expenditure, His pardon, for your sins, and His bounty, as sustenance from Him; and God is Embracing, in His bounty, Knowing, the one who expends.",
  "He gives wisdom, that is, the profitable knowledge that leads to [righteous] action, to whomever He will, and he who is given wisdom, has been given much good, because he will end up in perpetual bliss; yet none remembers (the t\u0027 of yadhdhakkar has been assimilated with the dhl), that is to say, [none] is admonished, but the people of pith, possessors of intellects.",
  "And whatever expenditure you expend, be it as alms or a voluntary almsgiving, and whatever vow you make, and fulfil, surely God knows it, and will requite you for it. For the evildoers, who prevent almsgiving and vows, or expend other than the way they should, in disobedience to God, they have no helpers, to protect them from His chastisement.",
  "If you proclaim, make manifest, your voluntary almsgivings, that is, your supererogatory deeds, it is a fine thing, to show them; but if you conceal them, and give them to the poor, that is even better for you, than making them manifest or giving it to the rich. As regards the obligatory almsgiving, it is better to make it manifest, so that it serves as an example and so that one is not accused [falsely of not giving]; as regards giving it to the poor, this is obligatory; and it will absolve you of, some of, your evil deeds (read yukaffir, \u0060it will absolve\u0027, or nukaffir, \u0060We will absolve\u0027, either in apocopated form [with no final vowel, yukaffir, nukaffir], being a supplement to the locus of fa-huwa, \u0060that is\u0027, or with nominative inflection [yukaffiru, nukaffiru], indicating the beginning of a new sentence). God is aware of what you do, knowing its inner and outer aspects, nothing of it being hidden from Him.",
  "When the Prophet (s) was prohibited from giving voluntary alms to idolaters [as an incentive] for them to embrace Islam, the following was revealed: You are not responsible for guiding them, that is to say, for people, that they should embrace Islam, [you are responsible] only for conveying the Message [to them]; but God guides, with His guidance, whomever He will, to embrace Islam. And whatever good, property, you expend is for yourselves, since the reward is for you; for then you are expending, desiring only God\u0027s Face (this clause is the predicate, denoting a prohibition), that is to say, His reward and not any other transient object of this world, and whatever good you expend, its requital, shall be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged, you will not suffer any diminishment of it (both [of the last two] sentences emphasise the first one).",
  "For the poor (this is the predicate of the missing subject, al-sadaqt, \u0060voluntary almsgiving\u0027), who are constrained in the way of God, those who have confined themselves [in preparation] for the struggle: this was revealed concerning the people of Suffa, consisting in some four hundred of the Emigrants (muhjirn), set apart [from the other Muslims] for the study of the Qur\u0027n and to take part in raids; and they are unable to journey (darban, means safaran) in the land, to engage in commerce and earn their living, since they are fully engaged in the struggle; the ignorant man supposes them, on account of the way they behave, rich because of their abstinence, that is, their refraining from asking for things; but you, the one being addressed, shall know them by their mark, by the signs of their humility and exertion; they do not beg of men, and make urgent demands, importunately, that is to say, they do not beg in the first place, so there is no question of persistence. And whatever good you expend, surely God has knowledge of it, and will requite it accordingly.",
  "Those who expend their wealth night and day, secretly and openly, their wage awaits them with their Lord, and no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve.",
  "Those who devour, that is, [those who] seize by way of, usury, which is an excess [levied] in transactions of money or foodstuffs either on their value or on credit, shall not rise again, from their graves, except, rising, as one whom Satan has made prostrate, demented, from touch, [through] madness (min al-mass, \u0060from touch\u0027, is semantically connected to yaqmna, \u0060they rise\u0027); that, which befalls them, is because, of the fact that, they say, \u0060Trade is like usury\u0027, in terms of permissibility: this [statement] is a type of reversed simile used for intensity [sc. \u0060usury is like trade\u0027 is the expected word order]. God responds to them saying that: God has permitted trade, and forbidden usury. Whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and desists, from devouring it, he shall have his past gains, those made before the prohibition and which cannot be reclaimed from him, and his affair, with regard to pardoning him, is committed to God; but whoever reverts, to devouring it, treating it like trade in terms of lawfulness -- those are the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding therein.",
  "God effaces usury, diminishing it and eliminating any blessing in it, but He augments voluntary almsgivings with interest, increasing them, making them grow and multiplying their reward. God loves not, that is to say, He will requite, any guilty, profligate devouring it, ingrate, who deems usury licit.",
  "Those who believe and perform righteous deeds, and establish the prayer, and pay the alms -- their wage awaits them with their Lord, and no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve.",
  "O you who believe, fear God, and give up, abandon, the usury that is outstanding, if you are believers, true to your faith, since it is expected of the believer that he adhere to God\u0027s command: this was revealed when some of the Companions, after the prohibition, wanted to reclaim some of the usury from before.",
  "But if you do not, do what you have been commanded, then be warned, have knowledge, of war from God, and His Messenger, against you: herein is a grave threat for them. When it was revealed, they said, \u0060What power can we have in a war against Him!\u0027 Yet if you repent, and forgo it, you shall have your principal sums, the original amounts, not being unjust, by charging interest, and no injustice being done to you, by way of any diminution.",
  "And if any man, in debt, should be in difficulties, then, let him have, respite, a postponement, till things are easier (read maysara or maysura, meaning \u0060a time of ease\u0027); but that you should give (tassaddaq, where the second t\u0027 of the softened form, tatasaddaq, has been assimilated with the sd), the one in difficulty, a voluntary almsgiving, by waiving his debt, is better for you, did you but know, [if you know] that it is better for you, then do it. In a hadth it is said, \u0060Whoever gives respite to one in difficulty, or waives his debt, God will place him under His shade, on a day when there shall be no shade except God\u0027s\u0027, as reported by Muslim.",

  "O you who believe, when you contract, when you are dealing with, a debt, such as in prepayment for (future) delivery of goods or a loan, one upon another for a stated, a known, term, write it down, as confirmation and security against any dispute; and let a writer write it, the contract of debt, down between you justly, accurately, not increasing or decreasing the amount or the terms; and let not any writer refuse to write it down, if he is requested for such a task, as God has taught him (the kf of ka-m, \u0060as\u0027, is semantically connected to the verb ya\u0027ba, \u0060refuse\u0027), that is, just as He has given him the advantage of knowing how to write, he should not be niggardly in this respect; so let him write (repeated for emphasis), and let the debtor dictate, to the one writing the contract, for he is the one being witnessed, and must be fully aware of his obligations; and let him fear God his Lord, when dictating, and not diminish anything of it, of the debt due. And if the debtor be a fool, a squanderer, or weak, not up to dictating on account of old age or immaturity, or unable to dictate himself, on account of being dumb, or not knowing the language and so forth, then let his guardian, the one in charge of his affairs, be it a parent, an executor, a custodian or an interpreter, dictate justly. And summon to bear witness, the debt, two witnesses, men, mature Muslim free men; or if the two, witnesses, be not men, then one man and two women, to bear witness, such witnesses as you approve of, on account of their piety and probity; the number of women is because of the fact, so that if one of the two women errs, forgets the testimony, given their lesser astuteness and accuracy; the other, the one remembering, will remind her (read fa-tudhakkira or fa-tudhkira), the one that has forgotten -- the \u0060reminding\u0027 clause is the reason [for the choice of two women], that is to say, so that she may be reminded if she errs or strays into error, because this [forgetfulness] is the cause of it (a variant reading [for an, \u0060that\u0027] has the conditional in, \u0060if\u0027, with [the verb inflected as] tudhakkiru, \u0060she will remind\u0027, making it a new sentence, the response to which [follows]); and let the witnesses not refuse, whenever (the m of idh m, \u0060whenever\u0027, is extra) they are summoned, to bear witness and take responsibility for the testimony; and be not disdainful, lazy, to write it down, that which you have witnessed in truth (for this frequently occurred), be it, small or great, a little or much, with its term, that is, the date on which it is due (il ajlihi is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the [pronominal suffix] h\u0027 of taktub-hu, \u0060you write it down\u0027); that, writing down, is more equitable, more just, in God\u0027s sight, more upright for testimony, that is to say, [that is] more helpful in summoning witness, because it contains the reminder; and nearer, closer to attaining [the desired state] that you will not be in doubt, with regard to the amount and the due dates; unless it be, [that] there is, trade carried out there and then (tijratun hdiratun: a variant reading has tijratan hdiratan, in which case the nominal sentence is missing its subject, and must be the pronoun for tijra, \u0060trade\u0027, that is, hiya, \u0060it [fem. pronoun]\u0027) that you give and take between you, without there being a time- frame, then you will not be at fault if you do not write it, the merchandise itself, down. And take witnesses, over it, when you are trading with one another, for this is a better means of preventing dispute. The provisions here are delegated (to the personal choice of the people involved). And let not either writer or witness, the creditor and the debtor, be pressed, to distorting [the agreement], being prevented from testimony or dictation; nor should the creditor press them by charging them with what is not suitable for the testimony or the dictation; and if you do, what is prohibited to you, that is sinfulness, a rebellion against obedience, and lack of truth, in you. And fear God, in what He commands and prohibits. God teaches you (wa-yu\u0060allimukumu Llhu, is an implied circumstantial qualifier or it denotes the beginning of a new clause), what is in your best interests, and God knows all things.",
  "And if you are upon a journey, travelling and you contract a debt, and you do not find a writer, then a pledge (ruhun or rihn, plural of rahn) in hand, as a guarantee for you. The Sunna clarifies the permissibility of making pledges in towns, where writers may be forthcoming; but the stipulation is made in the event of travel because in this case it is more important to have a guarantee; God\u0027s reference to it being \u0060in hand\u0027 (maqbda) is a condition for the pledge given to be valid, and to satisfy the pledgee or his representative. But if one of you, the creditor, trusts another, the debtor, over the debt and does not require a pledge, let him who is trusted, the debtor, deliver his trust, the debt; and let him fear God his Lord, when delivering it. And do not conceal the testimony, if you are summoned to give it; whoever conceals it, his heart is sinful: the heart is mentioned because it is the locus of the testimony, and because if it sins, there are other sinful consequences, and so the person will be punished as though he were a sinner; and God knows what you do, nothing of which can be hidden from Him.",
  "To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Whether you disclose, manifest, what is in your hearts or hide it, of evil and resolve for it, God shall take you to account for it, informing you of it on the Day of Resurrection. Then He will forgive whom He will, to forgive, and chastise whom He will, to chastise (both verbs are apocopated [fa-yaghfir, \u0060he will forgive\u0027, wa-yu\u0060adhdhib, \u0060he will chastise\u0027] if taken as the responses to the conditional, in tubd, \u0060if you proclaim\u0027; but they may also be read with a final nominative inflection [yaghfiru, yu\u0060adhdhibu] in which case, it would [constitute a new clause and] follow on from an implicit fa- huwa, \u0060then He\u0027). And God has power over all things, including reckoning with you and requiting you.",

And they say, \u0060We hear, what we have been enjoined to hear and accept, and obey; we ask you: Your forgiveness, our Lord; to You is the homecoming\u0027, that is, the return at the Resurrection. When the previous verse was revealed, the believers complained of evil whisperings and it grieved them that they should be taken to account according to [the principle expressed in] it, and so the following was revealed:",
  "God charges no soul save to its capacity, that is, what it is capable of bearing; for it is what it has merited, of good and its reward, and against it is what it has earned, of evil and its burden: no person shall be requited for another\u0027s sin or for what he has not earned, even if he was tempted to do it. Say: Our Lord, take us not to task, by way of chastisement, if we forget, or err, by straying from the right path unknowingly -- as You used to take to task those before us: God has lifted this [burden] from this community, as reported in hadth. The petition here, then, is a way of acknowledging God\u0027s favour; our Lord, burden us not with a load, an affair which we cannot bear, such as You did lay upon those before us, namely, upon the Children of Israel, as for example, the killing of oneself in repentance, the paying of a quarter of one\u0027s property for alms, and the severing of the impure part. Our Lord, do not burden us beyond what we have the power, the strength, to bear, of obligations and trials; and pardon us, effacing our sins, and forgive us, and have mercy on us, with mercy added to Your forgiveness; You are our Patron, our Master and the Guardian of our affairs; so grant us assistance against the disbelieving folk, by establishing definitive proof [for us] and victory over them in battle, for it is expected of a patron that he assist his clients against their enemies. In a hadth it is stated that when this verse was revealed and the Prophet (s) was reciting it, after each word it was said to him, \u0022Granted\u0022.

  "Alif Lm Mm: God knows best what He means by these [letters].",
  "God! There is no god except Him, the Living, the Eternal.",
  "He has revealed to you, O Muhammad (s), the Book, the Qur\u0027n, enveloped, by the truth, with veracity, in what it announces, confirming what was before it, of Books; and He revealed the Torah and the Gospel",
  "before, that is to say, before revealing it [the Qur\u0027n], as guidance (hudan, a circumstantial qualifier meaning, hdiyn, \u0060guides from error\u0027) to people, to those who followed these two [Books] (He uses the word anzala for the revelation of these two, and nazzala for that of the Qur\u0027n, for the latter entails repetition, whereas the two Books were revealed in one instance); and He revealed the Criterion (al-furqn), meaning the Scriptures that discriminate between truth and falsehood. He mentions this [Criterion] after He has mentioned the three Scriptures so that it encompasses all [revealed Scriptures] besides these. As for those who disbelieve in God\u0027s signs, the Qur\u0027n or any other [revelation], for them awaits a terrible chastisement; God is Mighty, victorious in His affair, so that nothing can prevent Him from effecting His promise and His threat; Lord of Retribution, with a severe punishment for those that disobeyed Him, the like of which none can do.",
  "Nothing, no existent thing, whatever is hidden in heaven and earth from God, on account of His knowledge of universals and particulars. God specifies them [heaven and earth] because sensory perception does not go beyond these.",
  "He it is Who forms you in the wombs as He will, as males or females, white, black or otherwise. There is no god except Him, the Mighty, in His Kingdom, the Wise, in His actions.",
  "He it is Who revealed to you the Book, wherein are verses [that are] clear, lucid in proof, forming the Mother Book, the original basis for rulings, and others allegorical, whose meanings are not known, such as the opening verses of some sras. He [God] refers to the whole [Qur\u0027n] as: 1) \u0060clear\u0027 [muhkam] where He says [A Book] whose verses have been made clear [Q. 11:1], meaning that it contains no imperfections; and as 2) \u0060allegorical\u0027 [mutashbih], where He says A Book consimilar [Q. 39:23], meaning that its parts resemble each other in terms of beauty and veracity. As for those in whose hearts is deviation, inclination away from truth, they follow the allegorical part, desiring sedition, among the ignorant of them, throwing them into specious arguments and confusion, and desiring its interpretation, its explanation, and none knows its interpretation, its explanation, save God, Him alone. And those firmly rooted, established and capable, in knowledge (al-rsikhna f\u0027l-\u0060ilm is the subject, the predicate of which is [what follows]) say, \u0060We believe in it, the allegorical part, that it is from God, and we do not know its meaning; all, of the clear and the allegorical, is from our Lord\u0027; yet none remembers (yadhdhakkar, the initial t\u0027 [of yatadhakkar] has been assimilated with the dhl), that is, none is admonished, but people of pith, possessors of intellect, who, when they see those following that [allegorical part only], also say:",
  "Our Lord, do not cause our hearts to deviate, do not cause them to incline away from the truth, in [their] desire to interpret it, such as is inappropriate for us -- as You caused the hearts of those [others] to deviate -- after You have guided us, [after] You have shown us the way to it; and give us mercy from You, as a strengthening; You are the Bestower.",
  "Our Lord, You shall gather mankind for a day, that is, on a day, of which there is no doubt, no uncertainty, that is, the Day of Resurrection, when You will requite them for their deeds as You had promised; verily God will not fail the tryst, His promise of the Upraising: there is a shift of address here from the second [to the third] person and these [last words] could constitute God\u0027s speech. The purpose of their supplication in this way is to show that their concern is with the matter of the Hereafter, and for this reason they ask [God] for adherence to the path of guidance, in order to attain its reward. The two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim] reported that \u0060\u0027isha, may God be pleased with her, said, \u0060The Messenger of God (s) recited this verse: It is He Who revealed to you the Book, wherein are verses clear [to the end of] the verse, and said, \u0022When you see those pursuing the allegorical parts, [know that] these are the ones God refers to [in this verse], so beware of them\u0022 \u0027. Al-Tabarn reported in his al-Kabr that Ab Ms al-Ash\u0060ar heard the Prophet (s) say, \u0060I fear nothing for my community except three faults\u0027, and he mentioned that one of these would be when the Book is opened in front of them, and the believer will desire to interpret it, and yet none knows its interpretation, save God; and those firmly rooted in knowledge say, \u0060We believe in it, all is from our Lord; yet none remembers but people of pith\u0027 [Q. 3:7] [end of the] hadth.",
  "As for the disbelievers, neither their riches nor their children will avail, will protect, them against God, that is, [against] His chastisement; those -- they shall be fuel for the Fire, [they shall constitute] what the Fire will be fuelled by (read waqd [as opposed to wuqd], \u0060fuel\u0027).",
  "Their way is, as the way, as the habit, of Pharaoh\u0027s folk, and the, communities of people before them, such as \u0060d and Thamd, who denied Our signs; God seized them, He destroyed them, for their sins (this statement explains the previous one); God is severe in retribution.",
  "When the Prophet (s) enjoined the Jews to enter into Islam, after his return from Badr, they said, \u0060Do not fool yourself just because you killed a few men of Quraysh, inexperienced and knowing nothing about fighting\u0027, whereupon the following was revealed: Say, O Muhammad (s), to the disbelievers, from among the Jews, \u0060You shall be vanquished (sa-tughlabn, or [read] sa-yughlabn, \u0060they shall be vanquished\u0027), in this world, through being killed or taken captive and made to pay the jizya (which actually took place), and mustered, ([read] in both ways [wa-tuhsharna, \u0060you will be mustered\u0027, or wa-yuhsharna, \u0060they will be mustered\u0027]), in the Hereafter, to Hell, which you shall enter -- an evil cradling!\u0027, [an evil] resting place.",
  "There has already been a sign, an example (the verb qad kna, \u0060there has been\u0027, is used to separate [the statement to follow from the previous one]), for you in two hosts, two parties, that met, one another in battle, on the day of Badr; one company fighting in the way of God, in obedience to Him, namely, the Prophet and his Companions, who numbered three hundred and thirteen men, most of them on foot, with two horses, six plates of armour and eight swords; and another unbelieving; they, the disbelievers, numbering almost a thousand, saw them, the Muslims, twice the like of them, that is, more numerous than themselves, as the eye sees, in manifest vision, witnessing; and God granted them victory despite their fewer number; for God confirms, He strengthens, with His help whom He will, granting him victory. Surely in that, which is mentioned, is a lesson for people of vision, those who are discerning: so will you not be warned by this and become believers?",
  "Beautified for mankind is love of lusts, that which the self lusts after and calls for, beautified by Satan, or by God as a test -- of women, children, stored-up heaps of gold and silver, horses of mark, fine [horses], cattle, namely, camels, cows and sheep, and tillage, the cultivation of land. That, which is mentioned, is the comfort of the life of this world, enjoyed while it lasts, but then perishes; but God -- with Him is the more excellent abode, place of return, which is Paradise, and for this reason one should desire none other than this [abode].",
  "Say, O Muhammad (s) to your people, \u0060Shall I tell you, shall I inform you, of something better than that?, [that] which has been mentioned of lusts (this interrogative is meant as an affirmative). For those that are fearful, of idolatry, with their Lord (\u0060inda rabbihim is the predicate, the subject being [the following janntun...]\u0027) are Gardens underneath which rivers flow, abiding therein, decreed for them [therein] is eternal life, when they enter it, and spouses purified, of menstruation and other impurities, and beatitude (read ridwn or rudwn, meaning \u0060much pleasure\u0027) from God; and God is Seer, knower, of His servants, requiting each of them according to his deeds.",
  "Those (alladhna is either an adjectival qualification of, or a substitution for, the previous alladhna) who say: \u0022O, Our Lord, we believe, in You and in Your Prophet; so forgive us our sins, and guard us from the chastisement of the Fire\u0022.",
  "The patient, in obedience and against disobedience (al-sbirna, \u0060the patient\u0027, is an adjectival qualification [of alladhna, \u0060those\u0027]), truthful, in their faith, obedient, compliant before God, expenders, of charity, imploring God\u0027s pardon, by saying, \u0060Lord, forgive us\u0027 at daybreak\u0027, in the last part of the night, singled out here for mention because it is the time of unawareness and of the joy of sleep.",
  "God bears witness, [that is to say] He has made it clear to His creation through proofs and signs, that there is no god, none that is truly worshipped in existence, except Him, He has borne witness to this, and the angels, [have also borne witness to this] by affirming it, and those of knowledge, from among the prophets and the believers, through [their] conviction and in words; upholding, constantly and uniquely maintaining His creations with justice, (q\u0027iman, \u0060upholding\u0027, is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier and is governed by the import of the statement [implied to be something like] tafarrada, \u0060He alone is [upholding]...\u0027); there is no god except Him (He has repeated it for emphasis); the Mighty, in His Kingdom, the Wise, in His actions.",
  "Lo!, the religion with God, pleasing [to Him], is submission [to the One God], (al-islm), that is to say, the Divine Law with which the messengers were sent, founded upon the affirmation of God\u0027s Oneness (a variant reading [for inna, \u0060lo!\u0027] has anna, \u0060that\u0027, as an inclusive substitution for annahu to the end [of that verse, sc. shahida Llhu ... anna l-dna \u0060inda Llhi l-islm, \u0060God bears witness that religion with God is Islm]). Those who were given the Scripture, the Jews and the Christians, differed, in religion, some affirming God\u0027s Oneness, others rejecting it, only after the knowledge, of Oneness, came to them through transgression, on the part of the disbelievers, among themselves. And whoever disbelieves in God\u0027s signs, God is swift at reckoning, that is, at requiting him.",
  "So if they, the disbelievers, dispute with you, O Muhammad (s), concerning religion, say, to them: \u0060I have surrendered my countenance to God, [that is to say] I have submitted to Him, I, and whoever follows me\u0027 (wajh, \u0060countenance\u0027, is chosen here because of its noble character, for the other [parts of the body] will just as soon [surrender once the countenance has]); and say to those who have been given the Scripture, the Jews and the Christians, and to the uninstructed, the Arab idolaters: \u0060Have you submitted?\u0027, that is to say, \u0060Submit!\u0027 And so if they have submitted, they have been guided, from error, but if they turn their backs, to Islam, your duty is only to deliver, the Message; and God sees His servants, and so requites them for their deeds -- this [statement] was [revealed] before the command to fight [them] had been revealed.",
  "Those who disbelieve in the signs of God and slay (yaqtulna, is also read as yuqtilna, \u0060they fight against\u0027) the prophets without right, and slay those who enjoin to equity, to justice, and these are the Jews, who are reported to have killed forty�three prophets and to have been forbidden this by a hundred and seventy devout worshippers among them, each of whom was killed immediately. So give them good tidings, let them know, of a painful chastisement. The use of \u0060good tidings\u0027 here is meant as a sarcastic ridicule of them (the f\u0027 [of fa-bashshirhum, so give them good tidings] is considered part of the predicate of inna because its noun, that is, its relative clause, resembles a conditional [sc. in yakfurna, \u0060if they disbelieve...\u0027, fa- bashshirhum, \u0060then, give them good tidings...\u0027]).",
  "Those are the ones whose works, what good they did in the way of charity and kindness to kin, have failed, [whose works] are invalid, in this world and the Hereafter, and so they have nothing to reckon with, since these [works] are of no consequence; they have no helpers, [no] protectors from the chastisement.",
  "Have you not seen those who were given a portion, a share, of the Book, the Torah, being called to the Book of God (yud\u0060awna, \u0060being called\u0027, is a circumstantial qualifier), that it might decide between them, and then a party of them turned away, opposed? to the acceptance of its rulings. This was revealed concerning the Jews: two of them fornicated and they [the Jews] asked the Prophet (s) to adjudicate the case. He ruled that they be stoned, but they [the Jews] refused to do so. When the Torah was brought and consulted, the same verdict was found, and so the two were stoned, but they [the Jews] became wrathful.",
  "That, turning away and rejection was, because they said, \u0060the Fire shall not touch us, except for a number of days\u0027, that is, for forty days [only], the length of time their forefathers worshipped the calf, after which it would end; and the lies they used to invent, in their saying this, have deluded them in their religion (wa- gharrahum f dnihim, \u0060it has deluded them in their religion\u0027, is semantically connected to m kn yaftarna, \u0060the lies which they used to invent\u0027).",
  "But how will it be, their predicament, when We gather them for a day, that is to say, on a day, of which there is no doubt, no uncertainty, that is, the Day of Resurrection; and every soul, from among the People of the Scripture and others, shall be paid in full, the requital of, what is has earned, [what] it has done of good or evil, and they, that is, people, shall not be wronged?, in that no good deed shall be diminished, and no evil deed shall be increased.",
  "When the Prophet (s) promised his community sovereignty over the lands of Persia and Byzantium, the hypocrites said, \u0060How preposterous!\u0027, and so the following was revealed, Say: \u0060O God, Master of the Kingdom, you give the Kingdom to whom You will, from among your creatures, and seize the Kingdom from whom You will; You exalt whom You will, by giving it [the kingdom] to him, and You abase whom You will, by seizing it from him; in Your hand, in Your power, is good, that is, as well as evil. You are Able to do all things.",
  "You make the night to pass, to enter, into the day and You make the day to pass, to enter, into the night, each of them increasing by the amount by which the other decreases; You bring forth the living from the dead, such as humans and birds, from sperm-drops and eggs [respectively]; and You bring forth the dead, the sperm-drop and the egg, from the living, and You provide, with abundant provision, whom You will without reckoning\u0027.",
  "Let not the believers take the disbelievers as patrons, rather than, that is, instead of, the believers -- for whoever does that, that is, [whoever] takes them as patrons, does not belong to, the religion of, God in anyway -- unless you protect yourselves against them, as a safeguard (tuqtan, \u0060as a safeguard\u0027, is the verbal noun from taqiyyatan), that is to say, [unless] you fear something, in which case you may show patronage to them through words, but not in your hearts: this was before the hegemony of Islam and [the dispensation] applies to any individual residing in a land with no say in it. God warns you, He instills fear in you, of His Self, [warning] that He may be wrathful with you if you take them as patrons; and to God is the journey\u0027s end, the return, and He will requite you.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Whether you hide what is in your breasts, in your hearts, of patronage to them, or disclose it, manifest it, God knows it and, He, knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and God is Able to do all things, and this includes punishing those who patronise them.",
  "And remember, the day every soul shall find what it has done of good present before it, and what it has done of evil (the [last statement constitutes the] subject, the predicate of which is [what follows]), it will wish that between it and that there were a great distance, an extremely lengthy distance so that it [the evil] could never reach it. God warns you of His Self (this is repeated for emphasis), and God is Kind to His servants.",
  "When they said, \u0060We only worship idols out of our love for God, that they might bring us close to Him\u0027, the following was revealed: Say, O Muhammad (s), \u0060If you love God, follow me, and God will love you, meaning that He will reward you, and forgive you your sins; God is Forgiving, as regards the sins, committed previously, by one who [now] follows me; Merciful, to him.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Obey God, and the Messenger\u0027, as regards the [belief in the] Oneness of God which he enjoins upon you. But if they turn their backs, [if they] object to obedience, God loves not the disbelievers, meaning that He will chastise them (the [third person] pronominalisation [\u0060they\u0027] is replaced by the overt noun [\u0060the disbelievers\u0027]).",
  "Lo! God preferred, He has chosen, Adam and Noah and the House of Abraham and the House of \u0060Imrn, meaning [He preferred] their selves [sc. Abraham and \u0060Imrn], above the worlds, by making prophethood reside in [them and] their progeny:",
  "the seed of one, offspring from, another, of them; God is Hearer, Knower.",
  "Mention, when the wife of \u0060Imrn, Hanna, said, after she had reached old age and longed for a child, and supplicated to God and sensed that she was carrying child, \u0060O, Lord, I have vowed to, offer, You what is within my womb as a consecration, [one] liberated and delivered from the distractions of this world for the service of Your Holy House [in Jerusalem]. Accept this from me. Lo! It is You Who are the Hearer, of petition, the Knower, of intentions. \u0060Imrn died while she was still pregnant.",
  "And when she gave birth to her, a girl, and she had been hoping for a boy, since only males were consecrated to the service of God, she said, apologetically, \u0060O, Lord, I have given birth to a female\u0027 -- and God knew very well what she had given birth to: a parenthetical statement constituting God\u0027s speech (a variant reading [for wada\u0060at, \u0060she gave birth\u0027, has wada\u0060tu, \u0060I gave birth\u0027 [making these Hanna\u0027s words, sc. \u0060and God knows very well what I have given birth to\u0027]); the male, that she had asked for, is not as the female, that was bestowed upon her, because he is designed for the service [of God], while she would not be suitable on account of her lesser physical ability, her private parts, the effects of menstruation on her, and so on. \u0060And I have named her Mary, and commend her to You with her seed, her children, to protect them from the accursed, the outcast, Satan\u0027. In a hadth [it is stated]: \u0060Every new-born is touched by Satan and begins [life] by crying, except for Mary and her son\u0027, as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim].",
  "Her Lord accepted the child, that is, He received Mary from her mother, with gracious acceptance, and made her grow excellently, He made her grow up with excellent character. She would grow in a day by as much as a new-born grew during a year. Her mother took her to the priests, the keepers of the Holy House [of Jerusalem] and said: \u0060This here before you is the dedication [I offered]\u0027. They competed for [guardianship of] her, because she was the daughter of their religious leader, at which point Zachariah said, \u0060I am most worthy of her, for, her maternal aunt lives with me\u0027. The others said, \u0060No, [not until] we have cast lots\u0027. Thus, all twenty nine of them departed to the River Jordan, where they cast their quills, agreeing that the one whose quill remained fast and floated to the surface of the water would be most worthy of [being guardian over] her. Zachariah\u0027s quill remained fast [and surfaced]. He took [charge of] her and built for her a gallery-room with a ladder in the temple, and none apart from him went up to her. He used to bring her food, drink and oil, and would find her with summer fruits in winter, and winter fruits in summer, just as God says, and Zachariah took charge of her, he took her to him (a variant reading [of kafalah, \u0060he took charge of her\u0027] is kaffalah, \u0060He [God] gave Zachariah charge of her\u0027, with Zakariyy\u0027, or Zakariyy, in the accusative and \u0060God\u0027 as the subject of the verb). Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary, that is, the room, the most noble seat [in the temple], where she was, he found her with provisions. \u0060O Mary,\u0027 he said, \u0060Whence comes this to you?\u0027 She, still very young, said, \u0060From God, He sends it to me from Paradise,\u0027 \u0060Truly God provides, abundant provision, for whomever He will without reckoning\u0027, without consequence.",
  "Then, when Zachariah had seen this and realised that the One with power to bring something about in other than its [natural] time, is able to bring about a child in old age, and with those of his family line all deceased, Zachariah prayed to his Lord, when he entered the sanctuary to pray in the middle of the night, saying, \u0060Lord, bestow upon me from You a goodly offspring, a righteous son, verily, You are the Hearer of, [You are] the One Who answers, supplication\u0027.",
  "And the angels, namely, Gabriel, called to him, standing in the sanctuary, in the temple, at worship that (anna, means bi-anna; a variant reading has inna, implying a direct speech statement) \u0060God gives you good tidings (read yubashshiruka, or yubshiruka) of John, who shall confirm a Word, being, from God, namely, Jesus, that he is God\u0027s Spirit; he is referred to as [God\u0027s] \u0060Word\u0027, because he was created through the word kun, \u0060Be\u0027; a lord, with a following, and one chaste, forbidden from women, and a prophet of the righteous\u0027: it is said that he never sinned and never so intended.",
  "He said, \u0060My Lord! How shall I have a boy, a son, when old age has overtaken me, that is, [after] I have reached extreme [old] age, 120 years [old]; and my wife is barren?\u0027, having reached the age of 98. He said, \u0060So it, the matter, will be\u0027, with God creating a boy from both of you. \u0060God does what He will\u0027, nothing can prevent Him therefrom, and in order to manifest this great power he was inspired with the question so that he would be answered through it [this great power]. And when his soul longed for the swift fulfilment of that of which good tidings had been given:",
  "He said, \u0060My Lord! Appoint for me a sign\u0027, that is, an indication of my wife\u0027s pregnancy. He said, \u0060Your sign, for this, is that you shall not speak to men, that is, you shall refrain from speaking to them, but not from remembrance of God, save by tokens, gestures, for three days, and nights. And remember your Lord often, and glorify, perform prayer, at evening and dawn\u0027, at the end of the day and at its beginning.",
  "And, mention, when the angels, namely, Gabriel, said, \u0060O Mary, God has preferred you, He has elected you, and made you pure, of the touch of men; He has preferred you above all women of the worlds, that is, the inhabitants of your time.",
  "O Mary, be obedient to your Lord, be compliant before Him, prostrating and bowing with those who bow\u0027, that is, pray with those who pray.",
  "That, which has been mentioned of the matter of Zachariah and Mary, is of the tidings of the Unseen, of the news of what was unknown to you. We reveal it to you, O Muhammad (s), for you were not with them, when they were casting quills, in the water, drawing their lots so that it be manifested to them, which of them should have charge of, [which of them should] bring up, Mary; nor were you with them, when they were disputing, about the custodianship of Mary, such that you might have known it and related it; but truly you know it only through revelation.",
  "Mention, when the angels, namely, Gabriel, said, \u0060O Mary, God gives you good tidings of a Word from Him, that is, a boy, whose name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, He addresses her attributing him to her in order to point out that she will give birth to him without a father, for, the custom is to attribute the child to its father, honoured shall he be in this world, through prophethood, and the Hereafter, through [his] intercession and the high stations [al-darajt al-\u0060ul, cf. Q. 20:75], and of those brought close, to God.",
  "He shall speak to mankind in the cradle, that is to say, as a child before the age of speech, and in his manhood, and he is of the righteous\u0027.",
  "She said, \u0060Lord, how shall I have a child when no mortal has touched me?\u0027, neither through conjugality or otherwise; He said, the command, \u0060It is such, that God will create from you a child without a father. God creates what He will. When He decrees a thing, willing its creation, He says to it only: \u0022Be\u0022, and it is, that is, [and] \u0060he is\u0027.",
  "And We will teach him (read nu\u0060allimuhu, or, yu\u0060allimuhu, \u0060He will teach him\u0027) the Book, that is, script, wisdom, and the Torah, and the Gospel.",
  "And He will make him, to be a messenger to the Children of Israel, during his tender years, or after puberty. Gabriel breathed into the opening of her garment and she became pregnant. What happened to her after this is mentioned later in srat Maryam [Q. 19:21ff]. Thus, when God sent him to the Children of Israel, he said to them, \u0060I am God\u0027s Messenger to you\u0027, and, \u0060I have come to you with a sign, an indication of my truthfulness, from your Lord, and it is that, I will create (a variant reading for [the particle introducing the relative clause] ann, \u0060that I\u0027, has inn, \u0060truly I\u0027, indicating a new [independent] sentence) [that] I will fashion, for you out of clay like the shape of a bird (ka-hay\u0027at, \u0060something like the shape of\u0027: the kf is the subject of a passive participle) then I will breathe into it (fhi, the [suffixed] pronoun [-hi] refers to the [preceding] kf), and it will be a bird (tayran, is also read t\u0027iran) by the leave, the will, of God. So he created for them a bat, being the most perfectly-created of birds, and they would watch it flying, but when it went out of sight, it would fall dead -- so that the work of a creature [sc. Jesus] may be distinguished from the work of the Creator, namely, God, exalted be He, and that he might know that perfection belongs to God [alone]. I will also heal the blind (akmah is one that is blind from birth) and the leper; these two are singled out for mention because with both afflictions the person is completely helpless. He [Jesus] was sent in an age of [characterised by] medicinal science, and he cured, through supplication, fifty thousand in one day on the condition that each person would become a believer; and I bring to life the dead, by the leave of God -- He repeats this to preclude any false attributions of divinity to him -- he brought back to life his friend \u0060zar, the son of an old woman, and the daughter of the tithe-collector, all of whom lived on and produced offspring, and [he also brought back to life] Shem, son of Noah, but he died [again] immediately. I will inform you too of what things you eat, and what you treasure up, store, in your houses, and what I have never seen, and he would inform people what they had eaten and what they would eat. Surely in that, mentioned, is a sign for you, if you are believers.",
  "Likewise, I have come to you, confirming that which was before me of the Torah, and to make lawful for you some of that which was forbidden to you, in it. Thus he made lawful for them fish and birds which had no spikes; it is also said that he made it all lawful for them, so that ba\u0060d, \u0060some\u0027, means, kull, \u0060all\u0027). I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, He has repeated it for emphasis and to expand upon it: so fear God, and obey me, in what I command you of affirming God\u0027s Oneness and being obedient to Him.",
  "Surely God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This, that which I enjoin upon you, is a straight path\u0027. But they rejected him and did not believe in him.",
  "And when Jesus sensed, [when] he became aware of, their disbelief, and they plotted to kill him, he said, \u0060Who will be my helpers, departing, unto God?\u0027, to help His religion; The disciples said, \u0060We will be helpers of God, those who assist His religion: they were Jesus\u0027s intimates and the first to believe in him. [They were] twelve men who were of pure white complexion (hawar); but some say that they [were called hawriyyn because they] were bleachers of clothes (qassrn); we believe in, we accept the truth of, God; witness, O Jesus, that we have submitted.",
  "Lord, we believe in what You have revealed, of the Gospel, and we follow the Messenger, Jesus; inscribe us therefore with those who bear witness\u0027, to Your Oneness and to the truthfulness of Your Messenger.",
  "God says: And they, the disbelievers among the Children of Israel, schemed, against Jesus, by assigning someone to assassinate him; and God schemed, by casting the likeness of Jesus onto the person who intended to kill him, and so they killed him, while Jesus was raised up into heaven; and God is the best of schemers, most knowledgeable of him [Jesus].",
  "And mention, when God said, \u0060O Jesus, I am gathering you, seizing you, and raising you to Me, away from the world without death, and I am cleansing you of, removing you far away from, those who disbelieved, and I am setting those who follow you, those Christians and Muslims who believed in your prophethood, above those who disbelieved, in you, namely, the Jews, becoming above them through [definitive] argument and the sword, until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me shall be your return, and I will decide between you, as to what you were at variance about, as regards religion.",
  "As for the disbelievers, I will chastise them with a terrible chastisement in this world, through being killed, taken captive and made to pay the jizya, and the Hereafter, in the Fire; they shall have no helpers, none to protect them from it.",
  "But as for the believers, who do righteous deeds, He will pay them in full (yuwaffhim, is also read nuwaffhim, \u0060We will pay them in full\u0027) their wages. God loves not the evildoers, that is, He will chastise them. It is reported that God, exalted be He, sent him [Jesus] a cloud which raised him up, but his mother clutched to him in tears. He then said to her, \u0060Verily, the Resurrection shall bring us together again\u0027. This took place on the Night of Ordainment (laylat al-qadr) in the Holy House [of Jerusalem], when he was thirty three years old. His mother lived on after him for six years. The two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim] narrate a hadth [in which it is stated] that he [Jesus] will descend when the Hour is nigh and will rule according to the Law of our Prophet [Muhammad], and that he will slay the false messiah and the swine, break the cross and impose the jizya. In a hadth recorded by Muslim, he will remain for seven years; according to Ab Dwd al-Taylis, [he will remain for] forty years, and he will die and have prayers performed over him. It is possible that what is meant [by the forty years] is the total time he will have spent on earth, before he was raised and afterwards.",
  "This, what is mentioned of the matter of Jesus, We recite to you, narrate to you, O Muhammad (s), of verses and wise, clear, remembrance, namely, the Qur\u0027n (min al-yt, \u0060of verses\u0027 is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the [suffixed pronoun] h\u0027 of natlhu, and its operator is the demonstrative import of dhlika, \u0060this\u0027).",
  "Truly, the likeness of Jesus, his remarkable case, in God\u0027s sight, is as Adam\u0027s likeness, as the case of Adam, whom God created without father or mother: this is a comparison of one remarkable thing with another more remarkable, so that it convinces the disputer and establishes itself in one\u0027s mind more effectively. He created him, Adam, that is, his form, of dust, then said He to him, \u0060Be,\u0027, a human being, and he was; similarly, He said to Jesus, \u0060Be\u0027 -- without a father -- and he was.",
  "The truth is from your Lord (al-haqqu min rabbik, the predicate of a missing subject, which is [implied to be] amr \u0060s [\u0060the matter concerning Jesus\u0027]); be not of those who waver, those who are uncertain about it.",
  "And whoever, from among the Christians, disputes with you concerning him, after the knowledge, of his affair, that has come to you, say, to them: \u0060Come! Let us call our sons and your sons, our wives and your wives, our selves and your selves, and gather them together, then let us humbly pray and invoke God\u0027s curse upon those who lie\u0027, by saying: \u0060Lord, curse the one that tells lies concerning the affair of Jesus\u0027. The Prophet (s) had called upon the Najrn delegation to do this when they disputed with him about Jesus. They said, \u0060Let us think about it and we will come back to you\u0027. The judicious one among them said, \u0060You know that he is a prophet, and that every people that has ever challenged a prophet to a mutual imprecation has been destroyed\u0027. They left him and departed. When they went to see the Prophet (s), who had set out with al-Hasan, al-Husayn, Ftima and \u0060Al, he said to them [the Najrn delegation], \u0060When I supplicate, you say \u0060Amen\u0027; but they refrained from this mutual imprecation and made peace with the Prophet on the condition that they pay the jizya, as reported by Ab Nu\u0060aym. According to Ibn \u0060Abbs [the Prophet] said, \u0060Had they set out and performed the mutual cursing, they would have gone home and found neither possessions nor family\u0027. It is also reported that had they set out with this intention, they would have been consumed by fire.",
  "This, mentioned above, is the true story, the report free of any doubt. There is no god but God, and assuredly God is Mighty, in His Kingdom, Wise, in His actions.",
  "And if they turn their backs, rejecting faith, assuredly God knows the agents of corruption, and will requite them (here the [third person] pronominalisation has been replaced with the overt noun [al-mufsidn, \u0060the agents of corruption\u0027]).",
  "Say: \u0060O People of the Scripture!, Jews and Christians, come now to a word agreed upon (saw\u0027, is the verbal noun, meaning mustawin amruh, \u0060[a word] regarding which the matter is upright\u0027) between us and you, and it is, that we worship none but God (all is [made up of] an-l, \u0060that...not\u0027) and that we do not associate anything with Him, and do not take each other for lords, beside God\u0027, as you have taken rabbis and monks; and if they turn their backs, in rejection of God\u0027s Oneness, say, you to them: \u0060Bear witness that we have submitted\u0027, [that we are of] those who affirm the Oneness of God.",
  "When the Jews claimed that Abraham was Jewish and that they were following his religion, and the Christians made a similar claim, the following was revealed: O People of the Scripture! Why do you argue about, dispute over, Abraham?, claiming that he belonged to one of your [two] religions, when the Torah was not revealed, neither the Gospel, but, a very long time, after him, and it was only after these two were revealed that Jewry and Christianity came into being. What, do you not comprehend?, the falsehood of what you say?",
  "Lo! (h, \u0060lo\u0027, is for calling attention to something), You (antum, \u0060you\u0027, is the subject) are those (the predicate is [what follows]) who dispute about what you know, concerning the affair of Moses and Jesus, and your claim to be adhering to their religions: why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge?, of Abraham\u0027s circumstances; and God knows, his circumstances, and you know not.",
  "God, in order to dissociate Abraham [from their claims], said: No; Abraham in truth was not a Jew, neither a Christian, but he was a Muslim, professing the Oneness of God, and a hanf, who inclined away from all other religions towards the upright one; and he was never of the idolaters.",
  "Surely the people with the best claim, most worthy of, Abraham are those who followed him, during his time, and this Prophet, Muhammad (s) on account of his according with him as regards most [of the rulings] of his Law, and those who believe, from among his community, they are the ones that ought to say, \u0060We follow his religion\u0027, and not you; and God is the Protector of the believers, their Helper and Preserver.",
  "When the Jews called Mu\u0060dh [b. Jabal], Hudhayfa [b. al-Yamn] and \u0060Ammr [b. Ysir] to [join] their religion, the following was revealed: There is a party of the People of the Scripture who yearn to make you go astray; yet they cause none to stray, except themselves, because the sin for their leading [others] astray falls upon them, while the believers do not heed them in this; but they are not aware, of this.",
  "O People of the Scripture! Why do you disbelieve in God\u0027s verses, the Qur\u0027n, that includes all the descriptions of Muhammad (s), when you yourselves bear witness?, [when] you know that it is the truth.",
  "O People of the Scripture! Why do you confound, [why do] you mix, truth with falsehood, by distorting and falsifying [scripture], and conceal the truth, the descriptions of the Prophet, while you know?, that it is the truth?",
  "A party of the People of the Scripture, the Jews, say, to some among them, \u0060Believe in what has been revealed to those who believe, that is, the Qur\u0027n, at the beginning of the day, and disbelieve, in it, at the end of it, so that they, the believers, might then turn back, from his [Muhammad\u0027s] religion, and that they [the believers] will then say: these [Jews] are knowledgeable and they could only have turned away from it after accepting it because they know it to be false.",
  "And they also said: And do not believe except in one who (the lm of li-man, \u0060in one who\u0027, is extra) follows, accords with, your religion\u0027. God, exalted be He, says, Say, to them, O Muhammad (s): \u0060True guidance is God\u0027s guidance, that is Islam, everything else being error (this statement is parenthetical) -- that (an [and what follows] is the direct object of the verb wa-l tu\u0027min, \u0060do not believe\u0027) anyone should be given the like of what you have been given, of the Book, wisdom, and of the virtues (the term ahad, \u0060anyone\u0027, from whom the exclusion is being made, precedes that which is being excluded, \u0060the like of what you have been given\u0027, the meaning being: \u0060Do not affirm that anyone should be given this unless they follow your religion\u0027); or that they, the believers, should dispute with you, [that they should] prevail over you, before your Lord\u0027, on the Day of Resurrection, for you have the sounder religion (a variant reading has a-an, \u0060such that\u0027, the extra hamza denoting rebuke) in other words, [the Jews say do not believe] that another has been given the like of it, such that you might affirm it. God, exalted be He, says, Say: \u0060Surely bounty is in God\u0027s Hand; He gives it to whomever He will, so how can you say that no one else will be given what you have been given? God is Embracing, of ample bounty, Knowing, those who deserve it.",
  "He singles out for His mercy whom He will; God is of bounty abounding\u0027.",
  "And of the People of the Scripture is he who, if you trust him with a hundredweight, that is, with much money, he will return it to you, on account of his trustworthiness, the like of \u0060Abd Allh b. Salm to whom a man entrusted 1200 plates of gold, which he then returned to him; and of them is he who, if you trust him with one dinar, will not return it to you, on account of his treachery; unless you keep standing over him, not leaving him for one minute, for as soon as you leave him, he will deny it, as was the case with Ka\u0060b b. al- Ashraf, to whom a man from Quraysh entrusted a dinar and later denied it. That, refusal to return things, is because they say, \u0060We have no duty towards, namely, [no possibility of acquiring] sin because of, the Gentiles\u0027, the Arabs; for they considered it lawful to be unjust towards any person of a different religion, and they attributed [the source of] this conviction to God, exalted be He. God, exalted be He, says, They speak falsehood against God, by attributing such things to Him, while they are aware, that they are liars.",
  "Nay, there is a duty incumbent over them in this regard; but whoever fulfils his covenant, the one he has made or the covenant of God, by restoring a trust and other such things, and has fear, of God, by refraining from disobedience and performing deeds of obedience, for truly God loves the God-fearing: \u0060He loves them\u0027 means that He will reward them (the overt noun [al-muttaqn, \u0060the God-fearing\u0027] has replaced the [third person] pronominalisation).",
  "The following was revealed with regard to the Jews when they distorted the descriptions of the Prophet (s) and God\u0027s covenant with them in the Torah, and [God\u0027s covenant with them] regarding one that swears an oath to a falsehood when bearing witness or when selling merchandise: Those that sell, exchange, God\u0027s covenant, with them that they believe in the Prophet and return faithfully what has been entrusted to them, and their own oaths, their invoking God\u0027s name in mendacity, for a small price, of this world, there shall be no share, [no] lot, for them in the Hereafter; and God shall not speak to them, out of wrath against them, nor look upon them, [nor] have mercy upon them, on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, cleanse them, and theirs will be a painful chastisement.",
  "And there is a group, a party, of them, the People of the Scripture, like Ka\u0060b b. al-Ashraf, who twist their tongues with the Book, altering it by reciting it not according to the way in which it was revealed, but according to the way in which they have distorted it, as in the case of the descriptions of the Prophet (s) and other similar matters; so that you may suppose it, such distortion, as part of the Book, that God revealed; yet it is not part of the Book; and they say, \u0060It is from God\u0027, yet it is not from God, and they speak falsehood against God, while they know, that they are liars.",
  "When the Christians of Najrn claimed that Jesus had commanded them to take him as a Divinity, and some Muslims asked that they should be permitted to prostrate themselves before him, the Prophet (s), the following was revealed: It belongs not to any mortal that God should give him the Book, the Judgement, the understanding of the Divine Law, prophethood, then that he should say to men, \u0060Be servants to me instead of God.\u0027 Rather, he should say, \u0060Be masters, scholars, labouring (rabbniyyn, \u0060those of the Lord\u0027, is derived from rabb, \u0060lord\u0027, with the extra alif and nn, as a superlative [of rabbiyyn]), by virtue of what you know (ta\u0060lamn, also read as tu\u0060allimn, \u0060you teach\u0027) of the Book and in what you study\u0027, that is, on account of the fact that you used to do this, for its benefit is that you engage in action.",
  "He would never order you (read l ya\u0027murukum, to denote a new clause, meaning \u0060God [would not order you]\u0027; or if read l ya\u0027murakum, it would be a supplement to yaqla, \u0060he should say\u0027, meaning \u0060[it belongs not that...] a mortal [should order you]\u0027); to take the angels and the prophets as lords, in the way that the Sabaeans have taken the angels, the Jews, Ezra, and the Christians, Jesus. Would He order you to disbelieve, after you have submitted? He would not do this.",
  "And, mention, when God made a covenant with the prophets, \u0060What (if read lam, it would be introducing a subject clause, and emphasising the aspect of the oath in this \u0060making of the covenant\u0027; if it is read lim, it would then be connected to the verb akhadha, \u0060He took\u0027; the m, \u0060what\u0027, is a relative particle in both cases, meaning la\u0027lladh [or li\u0027lladh respectively]) I have given you (taytukum, or in a variant reading, taynkum, \u0060We have given you\u0027) of the Book and wisdom; then there shall come to you a messenger confirming what is with you, of the Book and wisdom, and that is Muhammad (s) -- you shall believe in him and you shall help him\u0027 (this constitutes the response to the oath), if you reach his time and perceive him, and their communities [of descendants] follow them [in what is incumbent upon them]. He, God, exalted be He, said to them, \u0060Do you affirm, this? And do you take, [do you] accept, My load, My covenant, on you on that condition?\u0027 They said, \u0060We affirm\u0027. He said, \u0060Then bear witness, to this before your own souls and [those of] your followers, and I shall be with you among the witnesses\u0027, before you and them.",
  "Then whoever turns his back, in rejection, after that, covenant, they are the wicked.",
  "What! Do they, the ones who turn away, desire (yabghna, is also read tabghna, \u0060[do] you desire?\u0027) other than God\u0027s religion, when to Him has submitted, [to Him] has yielded, whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly, without refusal, or unwillingly, by the sword and by seeing what it [such refusal] results in, and to Him they shall be returned? (yurja\u0060na, may also be read turja\u0060na, \u0060you shall be returned\u0027; the hamza at the beginning of the verse [a-fa-ghayra, \u0060what...other\u0027] denotes a disavowal).",
  "Say, to them, O Muhammad (s): \u0060We believe in God, and that which has been revealed to us, and that which has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael, and Isaac and Jacob, and the Tribes, the latter\u0027s sons; and in that which was given to Moses and Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord; we make no division between any of them, by believing [in some] and disbelieving [in others]; and to Him we submit\u0027, devoting worship sincerely [to Him].",
  "The following was revealed regarding those who apostatized and became disbelievers: Whoever desires a religion other than Islam, it shall not be accepted from him and in the Hereafter he shall be among the losers, because he will end up in the Fire, made everlasting for him.",
  "How shall God guide, that is to say, [He shall] not [guide], a people who have disbelieved after their belief, and bore witness, that is, [and after] their bearing witness, that the Messenger is true, and after the clear signs, the manifest proofs of the truth of the Prophet, had come to them? God guides not the evildoing, that is, the disbelieving, folk.",
  "Those -- their requital is that there shall rest on them the curse of God and of the angels and of men altogether.",
  "Abiding therein, that is, in the curse, or in the Fire implied by it [the curse]; the chastisement shall not be lightened for them and they shall not be reprieved, they shall [not] be given any respite.",
  "But those who repent thereafter, and make amends, in their actions, then truly God is Forgiving, Merciful, to them.",
  "The following was revealed regarding the Jews: Surely those who disbelieve, in Jesus, after they have believed, in Moses, and then increase in unbelief, in Muhammad (s) -- their repentance shall not be accepted, when they are drawing their last gasps of life, or when they have died as disbelievers; those are the ones who go astray.",
  "Surely those who disbelieve, and die disbelieving, the whole earth full, the amount needed to fill it up, of gold shall not be accepted from any one of them (the f\u0027 [of fa-lan yuqbala, \u0060it shall not be accepted\u0027] has been included in the predicate of the inna clause, because the statement about alladhna, \u0060those [who disbelieve]\u0027, resembles a conditional statement; and as a declaration of the reason for it [repentance] not being acceptable in the case of one who dies in unbelief) if he would ransom himself thereby; for them awaits a painful chastisement (alm is [the same as] mu\u0027lim, \u0060painful\u0027), and they shall have no helpers, to protect them from it.",
  "You will not attain piety, that is, the reward for it, which is Paradise, until you expend, [until] you give voluntary alms, of what you love, of your wealth; and whatever thing you expend, God knows of it, and He will requite it accordingly.",
  "When the Jews said to the Prophet, \u0060You claim that you follow the creed of Abraham, but Abraham did not eat camel\u0027s meat nor drink its milk\u0027, the following was revealed: All food was lawful to the Children of Israel save what Israel, Jacob, forbade for himself, namely, camels: when he was afflicted with sciatica (\u0060irq al- nas), he made a vow that if he were cured he would not eat of it again, and so it was forbidden him; before the Torah was revealed, which was after the time of Abraham, as it was not unlawful in his time, as they claimed. Say, to them: \u0060Bring the Torah now, and recite it, so that the truth of what you say may become clear, if you are truthful\u0027, in what you say; they were stupified and did not bring it [the Torah]. God, exalted be He, then said:",
  "Whoever invents falsehood against God after that, that is, after the proof has become manifest that the prohibition was made by Jacob, and not during the time of Abraham, those are the evildoers, that transgress the truth into falsehood.",
  "Say: \u0060God has spoken the truth, in this matter, just as He has in all that He has related; therefore follow the creed of Abraham, the one which I follow, a hanf, inclining away from all religions towards submission (islm), and he was not an idolater\u0027.",
  "When they said, \u0060Our direction of prayer (qibla) came before yours\u0027, the following was revealed: The first house, for worship, established for the people, on earth, was that at Bakka (a variant of Makka [Mecca], so called because it \u0060crushes\u0027 [tabukku] the necks of tyrants); it was built by the angels before the creation of Adam, and after it the Aqs [in Jerusalem] was built, a period of forty years separating them, as reported in the hadth of the two Sahhs [sc. of al-Bukhr and Muslim], and in the hadth [that states]: \u0060The first thing to appear on the surface of the water, at the creation of the heavens and the earth, was a white foam, underneath which the earth was unrolled\u0027; a blessed place (mubrakan, a circumstantial qualifier referring to la\u0027lladh, \u0060that\u0027) meaning a place of blessings, and a guidance to all worlds, because it is their qibla.",
  "Therein are clear signs, among which is, the station of Abraham, that is, the stone upon which he stood to build the House, and on which his footprints remain; and it [the House] has endured all this length of time and the constant passing of hands over it. Among these [signs] are the fact that the reward for good deeds is multiplied in it and that birds never fly over it; and whoever enters it is in security, not liable therein to be killed or oppressed or otherwise. It is the duty of people towards God to make the pilgrimage to the House (read either as hijj al-bayt or hajj al-bayt, as two variants of the verbal noun from hajj, meaning \u0060the intention [to journey there]\u0027), if he is able to make his way there (man istat\u0060a ilayhi sablan substitutes for al-ns, \u0060people\u0027). The Prophet (s) explained this [ability] as having provisions and a ride, as reported by al- Hkim [al-Naysbr] and others. As for the one who disbelieves, in God or in what He has made obligatory with regard to the Pilgrimage, God is Independent of all worlds, the humans, the jinn and the angels, and [is Independent of] their devotions.",
  "Say: \u0060O People of the Scripture, why do you disbelieve in God\u0027s verses, that is, the Qur\u0027n, when God is Witness of what you do?\u0027, and will requite you for it?",
  "Say: \u0060O People of the Scripture, why do you bar believers, causing them to turn away, from God\u0027s way, His religion, by denying the truth of the Prophet and concealing His graces, desiring to make it crooked (\u0060iwajan is the verbal noun, meaning mu\u0060awwajatan, \u0060made crooked\u0027), inclining away from the truth, while you yourselves are witnesses, [while] you know that the religion which is upright and pleasing [to God] is that of Islam, as stated in your Book? God is not heedless of what you do\u0027, in the way of unbelief and mendacity; instead He gives you respite until your appointed time and then requites you.",
  "The following was revealed when the Jews passed by the Aws and the Khazraj and were infuriated by their comradeship, and set about reminding them of their mutual hostility in the days before Islam, such that they caused them to quarrel and the two [tribes] were on the verge of fighting one another: O you who believe, if you obey a party of those who have been given the Scripture, they will turn you, after you have believed, into disbelievers.",
  "How can you disbelieve (this is an interrogative of amazement and rebuke) while you have God\u0027s verses recited to you, and His Messenger is in your midst? Whoever holds fast to, clings to, God, he is guided to a straight path.",
  "O you who believe, fear God as He should be feared, so that He is obeyed and not disobeyed, thanked and not shown ingratitude, remembered and not forgotten. They said, \u0060Who, O Messenger of God, is strong enough for this [task]?\u0027 But it was then abrogated by His statement: So fear God as much as you can [Q. 64:16]; and do not die, except as Muslims, professing the Oneness of God.",
  "And hold fast to, clutch, God\u0027s bond, namely, His religion, together, and do not scatter, after submitting [to Islam]; remember God\u0027s grace, His bestowing of favours, upon you, O companies of the Aws and the Khazraj, when you were enemies, and He brought your hearts together, through Islam, so that by His grace you became brothers, in religion and comradeship; and you were upon the brink, the edge, of a pit of fire, such that to fall into it you only had to die disbelieving; but He delivered you from it, through belief. So, just as He has made clear for you what has been mentioned, God makes clear to you His signs that you might be guided.",
  "Let there be one community of you calling to good, to Islam, and enjoining decency, and forbidding indecency; those, that call, bid and forbid, are the successful, the victorious (the particle min, \u0060of\u0027, [in minkum, \u0060of you\u0027] is partitive, since what is mentioned is a collective obligation [fard kifya], and is not incumbent upon every individual of the community, for not every person, such as the ignorant, is up to it. However, it is also said that this particle is extra, and what is meant is, \u0060so that you are a community [calling to good and so on]\u0027).",
  "Be not as those who scattered, in their religion, and disputed, over it, after the clear proofs came to them, and these are the Jews and the Christians, those there awaits a mighty chastisement.",
  "The day when some faces are blackened, and some faces whitened, that is, the Day of Resurrection. As for those whose faces are blackened, these being the disbelievers, who are thrown into the Fire and to whom it is said in rebuke: \u0060Did you disbelieve after you had believed, on the day the covenant was made? Then taste the chastisement for what you disbelieved!\u0027",

  "Those, that is to say, these verses, are the verses of God which We recite to you, O Muhammad (s), in truth, and God desires not any injustice for the worlds, punishing them for no crime.",
  "To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants, and to Him all matters are returned.",
  "You, O community of Muhammad (s), are the best community brought forth, manifested, to men, according to God\u0027s knowledge, enjoining decency, and forbidding indecency, and believing in God. Had the People of the Scripture believed, it, their belief, would have been better for them; some of them are believers, such as \u0060Abd Allh b. Salm, may God be pleased with him and his companions; but most of them, the disbelievers, are wicked.",
  "They, the Jews, will not harm you, O company of Muslims, in any way, except a little hurt, with their tongues, such as slander and threats; and if they fight against you, they will turn their backs to you, in retreat, then they will not be helped, against you, but you will be helped against them.",
  "Abasement shall be cast upon them, wherever they are found, so that they have no strength and no protection, save, if they be [clinging to], a rope of God, and a rope of the, believing, people, this being the latter\u0027s covenant of security for them on the condition that they pay the jizya, in other words, they have no protection other than this; they have incurred, they have ended up, with anger from God, and poverty shall be cast upon them; that, is, because they disbelieved in God\u0027s signs, and slew the prophets without right; that (dhlika is [repeated] for emphasis), is, because they disobeyed, God\u0027s command, and used to transgress, passing from what is lawful into what is unlawful.",
  "Yet they, the People of the Scripture, are not all alike, equal; some of the People of the Scripture are a community upright, with integrity, adhering to the truth, such as \u0060Abd Allh b. Salm, may God be pleased with him and his companions, who recite God\u0027s verses in the watches of the night, that is, during its hours, prostrating themselves, performing prayer (wa-hum yasjudn, \u0060prostrating themselves\u0027, is a circumstantial qualifier).",
  "They believe in God and in the Last Day, enjoining decency and forbidding indecency, vying with one another in good works; those, described in the way God has mentioned, are of the righteous, and some of them are not like this and are not righteous.",
  "And whatever good you do, O community, (taf\u0060al, \u0060you do\u0027, or if this is read yaf\u0060al, \u0060they do\u0027, then [it is referring to them] \u0060the upright community\u0027), you shall not be denied it ([read] in both ways [fa-lan tukfarhu, \u0060you shall not be denied it\u0027, or fa-lan yukfarhu, \u0060they shall not be denied it\u0027]), you shall not be deprived of its reward, but you will be rewarded for it, and God knows the God-fearing.",
  "As for the disbelievers, their riches shall not avail, protect, them, neither their children, against God, that is, against His chastisement: these two are singled out for mention because a person usually avails himself either by paying a ransom, or by [resorting to] the help of his children; those are the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding therein.",
  "The likeness, the description, of what they, the disbelievers, expend in the life of this world, in the way of enmity towards the Prophet or in the way of voluntary almsgiving or the like, is as the likeness of a wind wherein is a blast, of extreme hot or cold, that smote the tillage, the crops, of a people who have wronged themselves, through unbelief and disobedience, and destroyed it, so that they could not profit from it; so it is with what they expend, it perishes and they profit nothing from it. God did not wrong them, when they lost what they expended, but they wronged themselves, through unbelief, which necessitated this loss.",
  "O you who believe, do not take as intimates, as sincere friends, revealing to them your secret thoughts, anyone apart from yourselves, from among the Jews, Christians and the hypocrites; such men spare nothing to ruin you (khablan is in the accusative because the preposition [that usually precedes it, sc. f\u0027l-khabl] has been omitted), that is to say, they would not be remiss about corrupting you; they would love, they wish, for you to suffer ([al-\u0060anat means] extreme hardship). Hatred, enmity towards you, is revealed, it is manifested, by their mouths, by sowing discord among you and informing the idolaters of your secret [plans]; and what their breasts conceal, of enmity, is yet greater. Now We have made clear to you the signs, of their enmity; if you understand, this, then do not befriend them.",
  "Lo (h, \u0060lo!\u0027, is for calling attention [to something]), there you are, O believers, you love them, on account of their kinship and their [pretence of] friendship towards you, but they love you not, since they oppose you in religion; you believe in the Book, all of it, that is to say, in the Books, all of them, but they do not believe in your Book, and when they meet you they say, \u0060We believe,\u0027 but when they are alone, they bite at you their fingertips, in rage, in extreme fury at what they see of your mutual affection: the biting of the fingertips is used to figuratively express the severity of rage, even if there be no biting involved. Say: \u0060Perish in your rage, that is, be this way until the end of your lives, for you shall not see what will please you; God knows what is in the breasts\u0027, what is in the hearts, including that which these conceal.",
  "If good fortune, a favour such as victory or booty, befalls you, it is evil for them, it grieves them; but if evil, such as defeat or drought, befalls you, they rejoice thereat (the conditional statement here is semantically connected to the previous conditional, and what comes in between is a parenthetical [statement], the meaning being that their enmity towards you is endless, so why do you befriend them? Avoid them!) Yet if you endure, their harm, and fear, God by [not] befriending them and so on, their guile will not hurt you (read either l yadirkum or l yadurrukum) at all; God encompasses what they do (ya\u0060maln, or may be read ta\u0060maln, \u0060what you do\u0027), He has knowledge of it and will requite them for it.",
  "And, mention O Muhammad (s), when you went forth at dawn from your family, at Medina, to assign the believers, to have [them] occupy, their places, stations for them to stand at, for battle, and God hears, what you say, knows, your circumstances: this was the day of [the battle of] Uhud. The Prophet (s) set out with 1000 or 950 men, while the idolaters numbered 3000. The Prophet pitched camp at the ravine on Saturday 7th of Shawwl in year 3 of the Hijra. He had his back and that of his troops to Uhud. He arranged their lines and placed a group of archers under the command of \u0060Abd Allh b. Jubayr at the foot of the mountain and said to them: \u0060Defend us with your arrows in case they come up from behind us, and remain here whether we are being defeated or on the verge of victory\u0027.",
  "When (idh, substitutes for the previous idh) two parties of you, the Ban Salima and the Ban Hritha, the two flanks of the army, were about to lose heart, [about] to shrink from the battle and retreat, after \u0060Abd Allh b. Ubayy, the hypocrite, and his companions began to retreat. He [Ibn Ubayy] said, \u0060Why should we get ourselves and our children killed?\u0027 and he also said to Ab Jbir al-Salam -- who had said to him, \u0060I implore you by God for your Prophet\u0027s sake and yours\u0027 -- \u0060If we knew how to fight, we would follow you!\u0027 But God then made them [the Ban Salima and the Ban Hritha] steadfast and they did not abandon [the field]; and God was their Protector, their Helper, and let the believers rely on God, let them place their trust in Him and none other.",
  "When they were defeated, the following was revealed as a way of reminding them of God\u0027s favour: God already gave you victory at Badr, a location between Mecca and Medina, when you were contemptible, few in number and weapons. So fear God, in order that you might be thankful, for His blessings.",
  "When (idh, an adverbial qualifier of nasarakum, \u0060He gave you victory\u0027 [in the previous verse]) you were saying to the believers, promising them as reassurance [for them]: \u0060Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should reinforce you, [that] He should succour you, with three thousand angels sent down? (read munzaln or munazzaln, \u0060sent down\u0027).",
  "Yea, it is sufficient for you. In [srat] al-Anfl [it is stated] with a thousand [Q. 8:9], because at first He reinforced them with this [thousand], then it became three [thousand] then five [thousand], as God says: if you are patient, in encountering the enemy, and fear, God in not contravening [His command], and they, the idolaters, come against you instantly, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels accoutred\u0027 (read musawimmn or musawammn), that is to say, distinctively marked [for the battle]. Indeed, they were patient and God fulfilled His promise to them, so that the angels fought together with them riding upon piebald horses wearing yellow or white turbans, let loose down to their shoulders.",
  "What God ordained, that is, of reinforcement, was only as a good tiding to you, of victory, and that your hearts might be at peace, [that] they might be at rest, and not be terrified by the large number of the enemy as compared to your small number. Victory comes only from God, the Mighty, the Wise, He gives it to whomever He will, and [victory comes] not because of a large army.",
  "And that He might cut off (li-yaqta\u0060, is semantically connected to the clause containing nasarakum, \u0060He gave you victory\u0027), that is to say, that He might destroy, a party of the disbelievers, by slaying them or making them fall captive, or suppress them, humiliate them through defeat, so that they fall back, return, frustrated, not having secured what they desired.",
  "When, on the Day of Uhud, the Prophet received a head wound and his front tooth was broken, and he said, \u0060How does a people who have drenched the face of their Prophet in blood [expect to] prosper?\u0027, the following was revealed: It is no concern at all of yours, nay, it is God\u0027s concern, so be patient, whether, meaning, until such time as, He relents to them, through [their acceptance of] Islam, or chastises them; for they are indeed evildoers, by [virtue of their] disbelief.",
  "To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants; He forgives whom He wills, forgiveness for, and chastises whom He wills, chastisement for. And God is Forgiving, of His friends, Merciful, to those who obey Him.",
  "O you who believe, do not exact usury, twofold and severalfold (read mud\u0060afatan or mud\u0060afatan) by increasing the amount [to be repaid] when the [loan] period comes to an end and delaying the request [of the loan]. And fear God, by abandoning such [usury], so that you may prosper, [that] you may triumph.",
  "And fear the Fire that has been prepared for the disbelievers, lest you be chastised with it.",
  "And obey God and the Messenger, so that you may find mercy.",
  "And vie with one another hastening (read wa-sri\u0060 or [simply] sri\u0060) to forgiveness from your Lord, and to a garden as wide as the heavens and the earth, that is, as broad as both of them together if put side by side, breadth denotes ampleness, that has been prepared for those who fear God in being obedient and abandoning acts of disobedience.",
  "Who expend, in obedience to God, in prosperity and adversity, in [times of] ease and difficulty, and restrain their rage, [and] desist from following it up even though they are able to, and pardon their fellow-men, those who wrong them, waiving their punishment; and God loves those who are virtuous, through such actions, that is to say, He will reward them.",
  "And who when they commit an indecency, a despicable sin such as adultery, or wrong themselves, with less than that, such as a kiss, remember God, that is to say, His threat of punishment, and pray forgiveness for their sins -- and who, that is, none, shall forgive sins but God? -- and who do not persist, persevere, in what they did, but have desisted from it, knowing, that what they did was sinful.",
  "Those -- their requital is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein (khlidna fh, an implied situation, that is, it is foreordained that they will abide in it once they enter it); excellent is the wage, this wage, of those workers, of obedience!",
  "The following was revealed regarding the defeat at Uhud: Ways of life have passed away before you, all manner of unbelief has preceded, where they have been given respite but are then seized [with punishment]; so travel in the land, O believers, and behold how was the end of those who denied, the messengers, that is, how their affair ended in destruction. So do not grieve on account of their victory, I am only giving them respite until their appointed time.",
  "This, Qur\u0027n, is an exposition for, all, mankind, and a guidance, from error, and an admonition for such as are God-fearing, among them.",
  "Faint not, shrink [not] from fighting the disbelievers, neither grieve, for what befell you at Uhud, for you shall prevail, through victory over them, if you are, truly, believers. (the response to this [last conditional clause] is the sum [meaning] of what has preceded it).",
  "If a wound touches you, befalls you at Uhud, a like wound (qarh or qurh, which is the exhaustion that results from a wound and the like), already, at Badr, has touched the other people, the disbelievers. Such days We deal out in turn, We dispense them, among mankind, one day for one group, the next day for another, that they might be admonished, and that God may know, through knowledge manifested outwardly, those who believe, who are sincere in their faith from others; and that He may take witnesses from among you, honouring them with martyrdom, and God loves not the evildoers, the disbelievers, that is, He will chastise them, and the blessings He bestows upon them are only a [means of] drawing out [their punishment].",
  "And that God may prove the believers, purifying them of sins through what befalls them, and efface, that is, destroy, the disbelievers.",
  "Or, nay, did you suppose you should enter Paradise without God knowing, through knowledge manifested outwardly, who among you have struggled and who are patient, in [times of] hardship?",
  "You were longing for (tamannawna: one of the two letters t\u0027 has been omitted from the original [tatamannawna]) death before you met it, when you said, \u0060Would that we had a day like the Day of Badr in order to attain what its martyrs attained.\u0027 Now you have seen it, that is, the cause of it, war, looking on, that is, with your eyes [open] and contemplating the conditions, so why did you retreat?",
  "With regard to their being routed, when it was rumoured that the Prophet had been killed and the hypocrites had said to the believers, \u0060If he has been killed, go back to your [previous] religion\u0027, the following was revealed: Muhammad is only a messenger; messengers have passed away before him. Why, if he should die or is slain, like others, will you turn back on your heels, will you return to unbelief (the last statement is the locus of the interrogative of denial, in other words, \u0060he was not a worshipped being, so that [if he were to die] you should turn back [to your previous religion]\u0027). If any man should turn back on his heels, he will not harm God in any way, but will be harming himself, and God will requite those that are thankful, for His graces by staying firm.",
  "It is not for any soul to die, save by the leave of God, by His decree, a prescribed (kitban, here a verbal noun, that is, God has prescribed this) term, that is to say, [a term fixed] in time, neither brought forward nor deferred, so why did you retreat [in defeat]? Defeat does not ward off death, nor does standing one\u0027s ground sever life. And whoever desires, by his deeds, the reward of this world, that is, his requital in it, We will give him of it, what has been alloted to him, but he shall have no share in the Hereafter; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We will give him of it, that is, of its reward; and We will requite the thankful.",
  "How many a prophet has been killed (qutila, a variant reading has qtala, \u0060has fought\u0027, the subject of the verb being the person governing it) and with him (ma\u0060ahu, the predicate, the subject of which [follows]) thousands manifold [fought], but they fainted not, they did [not] shrink, in the face of what afflicted them in God\u0027s way, of wounds and the slaying of their prophets and companions; they neither weakened, in the face of struggle, nor did they humble themselves, [nor did they] succumb to their enemy, as you did when it was said that the Prophet (s) had been killed. And God loves the patient, during trials, meaning that He will reward them.",
  "All that they said, when their prophet had been killed while they stood their ground and were steadfast, was, \u0060Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses, our overstepping the bounds, in our affairs, a declaration of the fact that what had befallen them was the result of their evil actions and a humbling of their selves, and make firm our feet, with strength for the struggle, and help us against the unbelieving folk\u0027.",
  "And God gave them the reward of this world, victory and booty, and the fairest reward of the Hereafter, that is, Paradise (husnuhu, \u0060the fairest of it\u0027, denotes [extra] favour in addition to what is deserved); and God loves the virtuous.",
  "O you who believe, if you obey the disbelievers, in what they command you, they will make you turn back on your heels, [back] to unbelief, and you will revert as losers.",
  "Nay, but God is your Protector, your Helper, and He is the best of helpers, so obey only Him and not them.",
  "We will cast terror (read ru\u0060b or ru\u0060ub) into the hearts of the disbelievers: after departing from Uhud they resolved to return in order to exterminate the Muslims, but they were terrified and did not return; for what they have associated, because of their associating, with God that for which He has revealed no warrant, that is, [no] argument in support of its worship, namely, idols; their abode shall be the Fire; evil is the abode, the resting place, of the evildoers, the disbelievers.",
  "God has been true to His promise, towards you, of giving you victory, when you slew them by His leave, by His will, until you lost heart, [until] you shrank from battle, and quarrelled, disagreed, over the command, that is, the command of the Prophet (s) that you remain at the foot of the mountain for the arrow attack, some of you saying, \u0060Let us depart, for our comrades have been given victory\u0027, others saying, \u0060We should not disobey the command of the Prophet (s)\u0027; and you disobeyed, his command, and abandoned your station in search of the booty, after He, God, had shown you what you longed for, of assistance (the response to the [clause containing] idh is indicated by what precedes it, that is to say, \u0060[when you lost heart] He denied you His assistance\u0027). Some of you desired this world, abandoning his station for the sake of the booty; and some of you desired the Hereafter, holding to it until he was slain, such as \u0060Abd Allh b. Jubayr and his companions. Then He turned you away (thumma sarafakum is a supplement to the response of the [clause containing] idh, implied to be raddakum bi\u0027l-hazma [\u0060He turned you back in defeat\u0027]) from them, the disbelievers, so that He might try you, that He might test you and so make manifest the sincere ones from those otherwise; yet now He has pardoned you, what you have done, and God is Bounteous to the believers, with pardon.",
  "Remember, when you were ascending, fleeing in the distance, not turning around, [not] stopping, for anyone and the Messenger was calling you from your rear, saying, \u0060Come to me servants of God, this way, servants of God!\u0027, so He rewarded you, He requited you, with grief, through defeat, for grief (ghamman bi- ghamm; the b\u0027 [bi-], \u0060with\u0027, is said to mean \u0060al, \u0060for\u0027) because of the grief that you caused the Prophet when you disobeyed [his command], that is, [with grief] doubled, [being] in addition to the grief of the booty forfeited, so that (li-kayl is semantically connected either to \u0060af, \u0060He has pardoned\u0027, or athbakum, \u0060He rewarded you\u0027; the l [of kay-l] is thus extra) you might not grieve for what escaped you, of booty, neither for what befell you, of being slain and [of] defeat; and God is aware of what you do.",
  "Then He sent down upon you, after grief, security -- a slumber (nu\u0060san, \u0060slumber\u0027 substitutes for amanatan, \u0060security\u0027) overcoming (yaghsh or taghsh) a party of you, namely, the believers. They would become dizzy under their shields and their swords would fall from their hands; and a party whose own souls distressed them, that is, they caused them grief, so that their only wish was their deliverance, regardless of the Prophet and his Companions, and they were unable to fall asleep: these were the hypocrites; thinking wrongly of God, thoughts of, those thoughts during the, age of ignorance, the moment they thought that the Prophet had been killed or that he would not be given victory, saying, \u0060Have we any part whatever in the affair?\u0027 (read [interrogative] hal as [negative] m) that is, [we have no part in] the assistance which we were promised. Say, to them: \u0060The affair belongs entirely (read accusative kullahu to denote an emphasis, or nominative kulluhu as a subject [of a new sentence], the predicate of which is [what follows]) to God\u0027, that is to say, the decree is His, He does what He wills. They conceal within their hearts what they do not disclose, what they [do not] manifest, to you, saying, (yaqlna, \u0060saying\u0027, is an explication of the preceding [statement]) \u0060Had we had any part in the affair, we would not have been slain here\u0027, that is to say, \u0060Had the choice been ours, we would not have set out and thus been slain; but we were forced to set out\u0027. Say, to them: \u0060Even if you had been in your houses, with some among you whom God had appointed that they be slain, those, of you, for whom it had been appointed, decreed, that they be slain would have sallied forth, would have gone forth, to the places where they were to lie\u0027, the battleground where they were to fall, and they would have been slain; and their staying put [at home] would not have saved them, for God\u0027s decree will be, inevitably. And, He did what He did at Uhud, that God might try, [that He might] test, what was in your breasts, your hearts, of sincerity or hypocrisy, and that He might prove, [that He might] distinguish, what was in your hearts; and God knows what is in the breasts, what is in the hearts. Nothing can be hidden from Him, and He tries people only to make [matters] manifest for them.",
  "Truly, those of you who turned away, from the battle, the day the two hosts, the Muslim host and that of the disbelievers, encountered each other, at Uhud, the Muslims, with the exception of twelve men -- truly, Satan made them slip, with his [evil] insinuations, through some of what they had earned, of sins, namely, when they disobeyed the Prophet\u0027s command; but God pardoned them; God is Forgiving, to believers, Forbearing, hastening not against the disobedient [with punishment].",
  "O you who believe, be not as the disbelievers, that is, [as] the hypocrites, who say of their brothers, that is, regarding their affair, when they travel in the land, and then die, or are on raiding campaigns (ghuzzan, \u0060a raiding party\u0027, is the plural of ghzin), and are then slain, \u0060Had they been with us, they would not have died and would not have been slain\u0027, in other words, do not say as they say -- so that God may make that, saying [of theirs], as a conclusion of their affair, anguish in their hearts. For God gives life, and He gives death, and so no staying put can prevent death, and God sees what you do (ta\u0060malna, or ya\u0060malna, \u0060they do\u0027), and He will requite you for it.",
  "And if (wa-la-in, the lm is for oaths) you are slain in God\u0027s way, in [holy] struggle, or die (read muttum or mittum, from [singular form] mta, yamtu), that is, if death comes to you thereat, forgiveness, that is, from God, for your sins, and mercy, therefor from Him for you (the clause introduced by the lm [of la- maghfiratun, \u0060forgiveness\u0027] is the response to the oath [clause of la\u0027in], and occupies the place of the verbal action as a subject, the predicate of which [is what follows]) are better than what they amass, in this world (read tajma\u0060n, \u0060you amass\u0027, or yajma\u0060n, \u0060they amass\u0027).",
  "And if (wa-la-in, the lm is for oaths) you die ([read] in both ways [muttum or mittum], or are slain, in the [holy] struggle or otherwise, it is to God, and to none other than Him that, you shall be mustered, in the Hereafter, and He will requite you.",
  "It was by the mercy of God that you, O Muhammad (s), were lenient with them, that is, [that] you showed indulgence [toward them] when they disobeyed you; had you been harsh, ill-natured, and fierce of heart, brutish and coarse towards them, they would have dispersed, split away, from about you. So pardon them, pass over what they have done, and ask forgiveness for them, for their sins, until I forgive them, and consult them, find out their opinions, in the matter, that is, your affair in the battle and otherwise, in order to win their hearts over and so that you may be emulated [in this respect]; and indeed, the Prophet (s) would frequently consult them. And when you are resolved, to carry out what you wish after counsel, rely on God, put your trust in Him and not in [any] counsel; for God loves those who rely, on Him.",
  "If God helps you, [if] He gives you assistance against your enemy, as on the Day of Badr, then none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, [if] He refrains from assisting you, as on the Day of Uhud, then who is there who can help you after Him?, that is, after His forsaking [you]? In other words, there is no one to help you. Therefore on God, and on no one else, let the believers rely.",
  "When some red velvet cloth went missing on the Day of Badr and some people began to say, \u0060Perhaps the Prophet took it\u0027, the following was revealed: It is not for a prophet to be fraudulent (an yaghulla, a variant reading has the passive an yughalla, meaning to attribute ghull, \u0060fraud\u0027, to him), to be treacherous with regard to the spoils, so do not presume this of him; whoever defrauds shall bring what he has defrauded on the Day of Resurrection, carrying it around his neck; then every soul, the fraudulent and the otherwise, shall be paid in full, the requital of, what it has earned, [what] it has done, and they shall not be wronged, a single thing.",
  "Is he who follows God\u0027s beatitude, being obedient and not defrauding, like him who is laden, [one who] returns, with God\u0027s anger, because of his disobedience and fraud, whose abode is Hell? An evil journey\u0027s end, a resort, it is!",
  "No! They are of degrees, that is, individuals of [different] degrees, before God, that is, belonging to varying stations: for those that follow His beatitude, a reward, and for those that are laden with God\u0027s anger, punishment; and God sees what they do, and will requite them for it.",
  "Truly God was gracious to the believers when He sent to them a messenger from among their own, that is to say, an Arab like them, not an angel or a non-Arab, so that they can understand what he says and feel honoured thereby, to recite to them His verses, the Qur\u0027n, and to purify them, to cleanse them of sins, and to teach them the Book, the Qur\u0027n, wisdom, the Sunna, though (in, is softened [in place of inna], that is, innahum, \u0060though they...\u0027) before, that is, before he was sent, they were in clear error.",
  "And why, when distress befell you, at Uhud, when seventy of you were slain, and you had afflicted twice the like of it, at Badr, slaying seventy of them and taking another seventy captive, did you say, in amazement, \u0060How is this?\u0027, that is, how did this defeat happen to us when we are Muslims and God\u0027s Messenger is among us (the last statement [ann hdh, \u0060how is this?\u0027] constitutes [the locus of] the interrogative of denial). Say, to them: \u0060It is from yourselves, because you abandoned your [battle] stations and were thus defeated. Surely God has power over everything\u0027, including [the giving of] assistance and the withholding of it, and He requited you for your disputing [the Prophet\u0027s command].",
  "And what afflicted you, the day the two hosts encountered, at Uhud, was by God\u0027s leave, by His will, and that He might know, through knowledge manifested outwardly, the, true, believers.",
  "And that He might also know the hypocrites, and those who, when it was said to them, after they had fled the fighting, namely, \u0060Abd Allh b. Ubayy and his companions: \u0060Come now, fight in the way of God, His enemies, or defend\u0027, us against the enemy by increasing the multitude [of our fighters], if you are not going to fight; they said, \u0060If we knew how, [if] we were skilled enough, to fight we would follow you\u0027. God then said, showing them to be liars: They that day were nearer to unbelief than to belief, for what they manifested of their forsaking the believers, whereas before they had been outwardly nearer to belief; saying with their mouths that which was not in their hearts, for even if they had known how to fight they would not have followed you. And God knows best what they hide, of hypocrisy.",
  "Those who (alladhna substitutes for the previous alladhna, or constitutes an adjectival qualification [of it]) said to their brothers, in religion, whilst they themselves, had, stayed put, [refraining] from [joining] the struggle, \u0060Had they, the martyrs at Uhud or those who stayed put with us, obeyed us, they would not have been slain\u0027. Say, to them: \u0060Then avert, ward off, death from yourselves, if you speak the truth\u0027, in that staying put delivers one from it [sc. from death].",
  "The following was revealed regarding martyrs: Count not those who were slain (read qutil or quttil) in God\u0027s way, that is, for the sake of His religion, as dead, but rather, that they are, living with their Lord, their spirits inside green birds that take wing freely wherever they wish in Paradise, as reported in a hadth); provided for [by Him], with the fruits of Paradise.",
  "Rejoicing (farihna, a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person governing yurzaqn, \u0060sustained\u0027) in what God has given them of His bounty, and, they are, rejoicing, joyful, for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind, from among their believing brothers (alldhna, \u0060those who\u0027, may be substituted by [what follows, sc. \u0060rejoicing...that no fear\u0027]): that no fear shall befall them, those that have not yet joined them, neither shall they grieve, in the Hereafter, meaning, they rejoice for their [brothers\u0027 future] security and felicity (all [of all khawfun] is an-l, meaning, bi-an l).",
  "Joyful in grace, in the reward, and bounty, in addition to it, from God, and that (read wa-anna as a supplement to ni\u0060matin, or wa-inna to denote a new clause) God does not let the wage of believers go to waste, but rewards them.",
  "Those who (alladhna, is the subject) responded to God and the Messenger, [to] his call to set out for battle: when Ab Sufyn and his companions wanted to resume [hostilities] they agreed with the Prophet (s) that the encounter would be at the [annual] market-fair of Badr a year from the date of Uhud; after the wounds had afflicted them, at Uhud -- (the predicate of the subject [alladhna] is [what follows]) for all those who were virtuous, by obeying him, and feared, to disobey him, shall be a great wage, namely, Paradise.",

Mas\u0060d al-Ashja\u0060, said, \u0060The people, Ab Sufyn and his companions, have gathered, their multitudes, against you, in order to exterminate you, therefore fear them\u0027, and do not go out to [encounter] them; but that, saying, increased them in faith, in their belief in God and in certainty, and they said, \u0060God is sufficient for us, He will deal fully for us with their affair; an excellent Guardian is He\u0027 , the One to whom the matter is entrusted. They thus set out with the Prophet (s) and arrived at the market-fair of Badr, but God had cast terror into the hearts of Ab Sufyn and his followers and so they did not turn up. They [the believers] had merchandise with them, and so they traded and made profits. God, exalted be He, says:",
  "So they returned, from Badr, with grace and bounty from God, safely and with profit, and no evil touched them, from any slaying or wounds; and they followed the beatitude of God, by obeying Him and obeying His Messenger, when they [agreed to] set out [for the battle]; and God is of bounty abounding, for those that obey Him.",
  "That, namely, the one saying to you, \u0060The people [have gathered against you]\u0027 to the end [of the verse], is only Satan making, you, fear his friends, the disbelievers, therefore do not fear them; but fear Me, lest you abandon My command, if you are, truly, believers.",

God desires not to assign them any portion, any lot, in the Hereafter, that is, in Paradise, and that is why God forsook them; and theirs is a mighty chastisement, in the Fire.",
  "Those who purchase unbelief at the price of faith, that is, taking it in place of it, they will not hurt God at all, with their unbelief, and there awaits them a painful chastisement (alm means mu\u0027lim, \u0060painful\u0027).",

And it is not God\u0027s purpose to apprise you of the Unseen, so that you could recognise the hypocrites from the others, before the distinguishing; but God chooses, He selects, of His messengers whom He will, apprising him of [some of] His Unseen, as when He apprised the Prophet (s) of the position of the hypocrites. So believe in God and His messengers; and if you believe and guard against, hypocrisy, then yours shall be a great wage.",

And God is aware of what you do (ta\u0060malna, also read ya\u0060malna, \u0060they do\u0027), and will requite you for it.",
  "Verily God has heard the saying of those, namely the Jews, who said, \u0060Indeed God is poor, and we are rich\u0027: they said this when the verse, who is he that will lend God a good loan [Q. 2:245] was revealed, adding that, \u0060If God were [truly] rich, He would not be asking us for loans\u0027. We shall write down, We shall order that it be written, what they have said, in the scrolls containing their deeds so that they will be requited for it (a variant reading [for active naktubu, \u0060We shall write\u0027] has the passive yuktabu, \u0060it shall be written\u0027) and, We shall write down, their slaying (read accusative qatlahum or nominative qatluhum) the prophets without right, and We shall say (naqlu, also read yaqlu, meaning God [shall say]) to them by the tongue of the angels in the Hereafter, \u0060Taste the chastisement of the Burning, the Fire.",
  "When they are thrown into [the Fire], it will be said to them: That, punishment, is for what your hands have sent before: \u0060hands\u0027 are used to designate a human being because most actions are performed with them; for God is never unjust towards His servants\u0027, punishing them without them having sinned.",

If it is accepted, a white fire will come down from the heaven and consume it, otherwise it will remain as it is. Such a covenant was made with the Children of Israel, but not in the case of Jesus and Muhammad. God, exalted be He, says, Say, to them in rebuke: \u0060messengers have come to you before me with clear proofs, with miracles, and with that which you said, [messengers] such as Zachariah and John, but you slew them: the address here is for those living at the time of our Prophet Muhammad (s), even though the deed was their forefathers\u0027, for they [their descendants] are content with it. Why did you slay them, then, if you are truthful?\u0027, about [the fact] that you would believe if it [the offering] were brought [to you].",

  "Every soul shall taste of death; you shall surely be paid in full your wages, the requital of your deeds, on the Day of Resurrection.

But they rejected it, they discarded the covenant, behind their backs, and so they did not act in accordance with it, and bought with it, they took in its place, a small price, of this world from the debased among them, enjoying supremacy over them in knowledge, and they concealed it, lest it [the supremacy] escape them; how evil is what they have bought, [how evil is] this purchase of theirs!",

(If one reads yahsabanna, \u0060let them [not] reckon\u0027, the two direct objects of the first h-s-b verb would be indicated by the two direct objects of the second h-s-b verb; but if one reads tahsabanna, \u0060do [not] reckon\u0027, then only second direct object would be omitted).",

When this was revealed they found it difficult to maintain guardianship over orphans, and some of them had ten or eight wives under their care, and did not treat them all equally, and so the following was revealed:",
  "If you fear that you will not act justly, [that] you will [not] be equitable, towards the orphans, and are thus distressed in this matter, then also fear lest you be unjust towards women when you marry them; marry such (m means man) women as seem good to you, two or three or four, that is, [each man may marry] two, or three, or four, but do not exceed this; but if you fear you will not be equitable, towards them in terms of [their] expenses and [individual] share; then, marry, only one, or, restrict yourself to, what your right hands own, of slavegirls, since these do not have the same rights as wives; thus, by that marrying of only four, or only one, or resorting to slavegirls, it is likelier, it is nearer [in outcome], that you will not be unjust, [that] you will [not] be inequitable.",
  "And give women their dowries (saduqt, plural of sudqa), their bridal money (mahr, muhr), as a free gift (nihlatan, is a verbal noun), a present given out of the kindness of one\u0027s heart; but if they are pleased to offer you any of it of their own accord (nafsan, \u0060of their own accord\u0027, is for specification and is taken from the subject of the verb [thus, it refers back to \u0060they\u0027, the women]), meaning, [if] their own selves are pleased that you should have something of the dowry and they give it to you then, consume it with, good, wholesome appetite, a praiseworthy consequence, with no harm therein for you with regard to the Hereafter: this was revealed in response to those who were opposed to this [consumption].",

  "Try, test, well the orphans, before reaching maturity with regard [the duties of] religion and [before] they can [legally] manage their own affairs, until they reach the age of marrying, that is, until they have become eligible for it through puberty or [legal] age, which, according to al-Shfi\u0060, is the completion of fifteen years; then, if you perceive in them maturity, that is, right [judgement] in matters of religion and their property, deliver their property to them; consume it not, O guardians, wastefully, without due merit, and in haste, that is, hastening to expend it, fearing, lest they should grow up, and become mature, at which time you will be obliged to hand it over to them. If any man, who is a guardian, is rich, let him be abstinent, that is, let him abstain from the orphan\u0027s property and refrain from consuming it; if he is poor, let him consume, of it, honourably, that is, in line with the wage for his work. And when you deliver to them, the orphans, their property, take witnesses over them, that they have received it and that you are absolved [of the obligation], so that if any dispute occurs, you are able to refer to a clear proof: this is a command [intended] for guidance. God suffices as a reckoner, as a guardian of His creatures\u0027 deeds and as a reckoner of these [deeds] (the b\u0027 [in bi\u0027Llhi] is extra).",

God has made it, an obligatory share, apportioned, to be given to them.",
  "And when the division, of the inheritance, is attended by kinsmen, those of kinship who cannot inherit, and orphans and the poor, grant them, something, out of it, before the division [is effected]; and, if the inheritors are young, speak to them, O guardians, honourable words, kindly, by apologising to them that it is not your possession [to divide as you wish], but that it is for the young [inheritors]. Some say that this [stipulation] was abrogated; others say that it was not, only that people were all too readily neglecting it, since it was encouraged [but not prescribed]. According to Ibn \u0060Abbs, however, it is a duty.",
  "And let them fear, let them be concerned for the orphans, those who, if they, are about to, leave behind them, that is, after their death, weak offspring, young children, would be afraid for them; that they be ruined; let them fear God, in the matter concerning orphans, and let them give what they would love for their own offspring after their death; and speak, to the one approached by death, pertinent words, the right [words], by enjoining him to give as voluntary almsgiving no more than the third [of the inheritance], and leave the remainder for the ones inheriting, so that they do not end up as dependants.",
  "Those who consume the property of orphans unjustly, without any right, are only consuming, the whole of it as, fire in their bellies, because that is where such [action] leads, and they shall be exposed to (read active yaslawna, or passive yuslawna), that is, they shall enter, a blaze, an intense fire, in which they shall burn.",
  "God charges you, He commands you, concerning, the matter of, your children, with what He will mention: to the male, of them, the equivalent of the portion, the lot, of two females, if there are two [women] with him, so that half the property is his, and the other half is theirs; if there is only one female with him, then she has a third, and he receives two thirds; if he is the only one, he takes it all; and if they, the offspring, be, only, women more than two, then for them two-thirds of what he, the deceased, leaves; likewise if they be two women, since in the case of two sisters, more deserving of such a share, God says, They shall receive two- thirds of what he leaves [Q. 4:176]; and since a female is entitled to a third with a male, she is all the more deserving [of the same share] with a female. It is said that fawq, \u0060more than\u0027, introduces a relative clause; it is also said to guard against the wrong impression that the greater the number [of females] the greater the portion [they are entitled to], since, it is [mistakenly] thought that the entitlement of two females to two- thirds derives from the fact that a female is entitled to one third when with a male; but if she, the daughter, be one (whidatan, is also read whidatun, making the kna [construction] syntactically complete) then to her a half; and to his parents, the deceased\u0027s, to each one of the two (li-kulli whidin minhum, substitutes for the previous li-abawayhi, \u0060to his parents\u0027) the sixth of what he leaves, if he has a child, male or female: the point of the substitution is to show that they do not share the sixth [but receive one each]. [The term] \u0060child\u0027 (walad) also applies to a grandchild, and likewise \u0060parent\u0027 (abb) to a grandparent; but if he has no child, and his heirs are his parents, alone or along with a spouse, then to his mother (read li-ummihi; also read, in both places [here and further down], li-immihi in order to avoid the cumbersome transition from a damma [\u0060u\u0027] to a kasra [\u0060I\u0027]) a third, of the property, or what remains after the spouse, the rest being for the father; or, if he has siblings, two or more, males or females, to his mother a sixth, and the rest for the father, and nothing for the siblings. The inheritance stipulated for those mentioned shall take place, after, the fulfilment of, any bequest that he may bequeath (read active ys, or passive ys), or, the repayment of, any debt, that he may owe. \u0060Bequest\u0027 comes before \u0060debt\u0027, even though it should only be fulfilled after the latter [has been repayed], to show that it should be taken seriously. Your parents and children (b\u0027ukum wa-abn\u0027ukum, is the subject, its predicate being [what follows]) -- you know not which of them is nearer in benefit to you, in this world and the Hereafter. It may be that one supposes his son to be beneficial to him, leaves him an inheritance, and then it turns out that the father had been the more beneficial [of the two], and vice versa. The only One with knowledge of this [reality] is God, and for this reason He has prescribed for you inheritance: a prescription from God; surely God is ever Knowing, of His creation, Wise, in what He has ordained for them, that is to say, He is ever possessed of such attributes.",
  "And for you a half of what your wives leave, if they have no children, from you or from another; but if they have children, then for you a fourth of what they leave, after any bequest they may bequeath, or any debt: the consensus is that the grandchild in this case is like the child. And for them, the wives, whether one or more, a fourth of what you leave, if you have no children; but if you have children, from them or from others, then for them an eighth of what you leave, after any bequest you may bequeath, or any debt; again the consensus is that the grandchild is as the child. If it be a man leaving an inheritance (yrathu, \u0060being inherited from\u0027, is an adjectival qualification, the predicate of which is [the following kallatan, \u0060without direct heir\u0027]) and not having a direct heir, that is, [having] neither a parent nor child, or it be a woman, leaving an inheritance and having no direct heir, but it be that such, a man leaving an inheritance with no direct heir, has a brother or a sister, from the same mother, as read by Ibn Mas\u0060d and others, then to each of the two a sixth, of what he leaves; but if they, the siblings from the same mother, be more than that, that is, [more] than one, then they share a third, the male and female equally, after any bequest to be bequeathed or any debt without prejudice (ghayra mudrrin, is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person governing [the verb] ys, \u0060to be bequeathed\u0027) in other words, without causing any prejudice to the inheritors by bequeathing more than the third); a charge (wasiyyatan, a verbal noun reaffirming [the import of] yskum, \u0060He charges you\u0027 [of the beginning of the previous verse]) from God. God is Knowing, of the obligations which He has ordained for His creatures, Forbearing, in deferring the punishment of those that disobey Him. The Sunna specifies that the individuals mentioned may receive the relevant inheritance provided that they are not barred from it on account of their having committed murder, or [their belonging to] a different religion or being slaves.",
  "Those, rulings mentioned with respect to orphans and what followed, are God\u0027s bounds, His laws, which He has delimited for His servants, so that they may act in accordance with them and not infringe them. Whoever obeys God and His Messenger, in what He has ruled, He will admit him (yudkhilhu, or, as a shift [to the first person plural] read nudkhilhu, \u0060We will admit him\u0027) to Gardens underneath which rivers flow, abiding therein; that is the great triumph.",
  "But whoever disobeys God, and His Messenger; and transgresses His bounds, him He will admit ([read] in both ways [as above, yudkhilhu and nudkhilhu]) to a Fire, abiding therein, and for him, in it, there shall be a humbling chastisement, one of humiliation. (In both [of the last] verses, the [singular] person [of the suffixed pronouns and the verbs] accords with the [singular] form of [the particle] man, \u0060whoever\u0027, while [the plural person in] khlidn, \u0060abiding\u0027, accords with its [general plural] import.)",
  "As for those of your women who commit lewdness, adultery, call four, Muslim men, of you to witness against them; and if they witness, against them such [lewdness], then detain them in their houses, and prevent them from mixing with people, until, the angels of, death take them or, until, God appoints for them a way, out of it. This was stipulated for them at the very beginning of Islam, but then a way out was appointed for them through [the stipulation] that the virgin should receive a hundred lashes and be banished for a year, and the married woman be stoned. The prescribed punishment was explained thus in the hadth, \u0060Come listen to me! Come listen to me! God has now made a way out for them\u0027, as reported by Muslim.",
  "And when two of you (read wa\u0027lladhni or wa\u0027lladhnni) men, commit it, that is, a lewd act, adultery or homosexual intercourse, punish them both, with insults and beatings with sandals; but if they repent, of this [lewd act], and make amends, through [good] action, then leave them be, and do not harm them. God ever turns [relenting], to those who repent, and is Merciful, to them. This [verse] is abrogated by the prescribed punishment if adultery is meant [by the lewd act], and similarly if homosexual intercourse is meant, according to al-Shfi\u0060; but according to him, the person who is the object of the [penetrative] act is not stoned, even if he be married; rather, he is flogged and banished. Judging by the dual person pronoun, it seems more obvious that homosexual fornication is meant [by this verse], even though the former [sc. al- Shfi\u0060] was of the opinion that it referred to an adulterer and an adulteress; but this [opinion of his] may be countered by the fact that [the reference to] the two [men] becomes clear on account of the particle min being attached to a masculine pronoun [minkum, \u0060of you\u0027], and by the fact that they suffer the same punishment, [both effect the action of] repentance and [are both granted] that they be left alone [thereafter], [all of] which applies specifically to men, given that for women detention is stipulated, as was stated before.",
  "The repentance that God accepts, that is, the one which He has prescribed for Himself to accept, out of His bounty, is only of those who do evil, an act of disobedience, in ignorance (bi-jahlatin, a circumstantial qualifier, in other words, \u0060they are ignorant\u0027 while they are disobeying their Lord); then repent shortly thereafter, before the last gasps of death; God will relent to those, He will accept their repentance. And God is ever Knowing, of His creatures, Wise, in what He does with them.",
  "Repentance is not for those who do evil deeds, sins, until, when death approaches one of them, and the pangs of death begin, he says, upon witnessing his predicament: \u0060Indeed now I repent\u0027, for this would not avail him and would not be accepted from him; neither for those who die disbelieving, if they repent in the Hereafter upon seeing the chastisement: it will not be accepted from them. Those -- We have prepared for them a painful chastisement.",
  "O you who believe, it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will (read either karhan or kurhan, as alternative forms) that is to say, coercing them into this. In pre-Islamic times, they used to inherit women from their kin, and if they so wished they could marry [a woman] without a dowry, or marry her off and take the dowry for themselves, or prevent her [from marriage] until she gave up what she had inherited, or until she died and they could inherit from her. They were thus forbidden such practices; neither debar them, your [former] wives from marrying others by retaining them while you have no desire for them yourselves, only to harm them; so that you may go off with part of what you have given them, of the dowry, except when they commit flagrant (read mubayyina, \u0060making it clear\u0027, or mubayyana, \u0060clear\u0027) lewdness, such as adultery or rebellion, then you have the right to coerce them until they redeem themselves to you or forfeit [their dowries]. Consort with them in kindness, that is, being decent in speaking [to them], with regard to [their] expenditure and lodging; for if you hate them, then be patient; it may happen that you hate a thing wherein God has set much good, that is to say, perhaps He does this when He provides you with a righteous child through them.",
  "And if you desire to exchange a wife in place of another, by divorcing the one, and you have given to one, of the spouses, a hundredweight, that is, a large sum as dowry, take of it nothing. Would you take it by way of calumny, injustice, and manifest sin? (buhtnan, \u0060calumny\u0027, and ithman, \u0060sin\u0027, end in the accusative because they are circumstantial qualifiers); the interrogative here is meant as a rebuke, and as a disavowal where He says:",
  "How shall you take it, that is, by what right, when each of you has been privily with the other, through sexual intercourse, which validates the dowry, and they have taken from you a solemn covenant, a binding pledge, and that is what God commanded, namely, that they should be retained honourably or set free virtuously.",
  "And do not marry women whom (m means man) your fathers married, unless it be a thing of the past, which is forgiven you; surely that, marrying them, is obscene, vile, and abominable (maqtan, means it results in maqt, \u0060severe hate\u0027, from God), an evil way, [an evil] path is this.",
  "Forbidden to you are your mothers, in marriage, and this includes the paternal and maternal grandmothers; and daughters, including their children, if they should lower themselves [to such standards]; your sisters, from your fathers and mothers; your paternal aunts, that is, the sisters of your fathers and grandfathers; and maternal aunts, that is, the sisters of your mothers and grandmothers; your brother\u0027s daughters, your sister\u0027s daughters, including the children of these daughters; your foster mothers who have given you milk, five times within the first two years, as pointed out in a hadth; your foster sisters, and, according to the Sunna, the daughters of these; and these foster-sisters include those suckled by a woman with whom the man has had intercourse, those suckled by the man\u0027s paternal aunts, or maternal aunts, or those suckled by his brother\u0027s daughters, or his sister\u0027s daughters, on account of the [Prophet\u0027s] hadth that, \u0060What kinship makes unlawful suckling also makes unlawful\u0027, as reported by al-Bukhr and Muslim; your mothers-in-law, your step-daughters (rab\u0027ib, plural of rabba, the daughter of one\u0027s wife from another husband), who are, being brought up, in your care (allt f hujrikum is an adjectival qualifier, reiterating the obvious, without any additional import); being born of your wives you have been in to, in sexual intercourse -- but if you have not yet been in to them you are not at fault, if you leave them, to then marry their daughters -- and the spouses of your sons who are of your loins, as opposed to those whom you have adopted, whose spouses, in contrast, you may marry; and that you should take to you, in marriage, two sisters together, [sisters] by kinship or by suckling: the Sunna adds that you may not marry her together with her paternal or maternal aunt; it is permissible to marry each of these separately or to own them [as handmaidens] together, but only have sexual intercourse with one of them; unless it be a thing of the past, from pre- Islamic times, when you may have married in one of the ways mentioned: you are not at fault. God is ever Forgiving, of what you have done in the past, prior to this prohibition, Merciful, to you in this matter.",
  "And, forbidden to you are, wedded women, those with spouses, that you should marry them before they have left their spouses, be they Muslim free women or not; save what your right hands own, of captured [slave] girls, whom you may have sexual intercourse with, even if they should have spouses among the enemy camp, but only after they have been absolved of the possibility of pregnancy [after the completion of one menstrual cycle]; this is what God has prescribed for you (kitba is in the accusative because it is the verbal noun). Lawful for you (read passive wa-uhilla, or active wa-ahalla), beyond all that, that is, except what He has forbidden you of women, is that you seek, women, using your wealth, by way of a dowry or a price, in wedlock and not, fornicating, in illicitly. Such wives as you enjoy thereby, and have had sexual intercourse with, give them their wages, the dowries that you have assigned them, as an obligation; you are not at fault in agreeing together, you and they, after the obligation, is waived, decreased or increased. God is ever Knowing, of His creatures, Wise, in what He has ordained for them.",
  "And whoever has not the means wherewith, [whoever] is not wealthy enough, to be able to marry believing (al-mu\u0027mint, \u0060believing\u0027, is in accordance with the prevalent practice, and does not add to the import), free, women in wedlock, let him take, in marriage, believing maids whom your right hands own. God knows very well your faith, so suffice yourself with its outward manifestation and leave the innermost matters to Him, for He is the One to know her [true] merit: many a slavegirl may be more excellent [in faith] than a free woman, and this is meant to encourage marriage with slavegirls; the one of you is as the other, being equal in religion, so do not disdain to marry with them. So marry them, with the permission of their folk, their guardians, and give them their wages, their dowries, honourably, without procrastination or diminution, as women in wedlock (muhsant, a circumstantial qualifier), in decency, not illicitly, openly fornicating, or taking lovers, companions fornicating in secret. But when they are given in wedlock, [when] they are married off (a variant reading [for the passive uhsinna, \u0060they are given in wedlock\u0027] has the active ahsanna, \u0060they enter into wedlock\u0027), if they commit lewdness, such as adultery, they shall be liable to half the chastisement, the legal punishment, of married, free, virgin, women, who commit adultery, and are thus given fifty lashes and banished for half a year; [male] slaves by analogy are liable to the same punishment. Here, God has not made wedlock the precondition for the prescribed punishment to show that stoning does not apply in their case [sc. slavegirls]. That, marrying of slavegirls on account of insufficient means, is for those of you who fear the distress of sin, fornication (al-\u0060anat originally means distress, but is used to mean zin, \u0060fornication\u0027, because of the distress that it causes in the way of the punishment in this world and in the Hereafter), as opposed to those of you who might not have such a fear [of distress] with regard to their free women and for whom it is unlawful to marry her [the slavegirl]; likewise for one who has sufficient means to marry a free woman [it is unlawful for him to marry a slavegirl instead]: this is the opinion of al- Shfi\u0060. Moreover, God\u0027s words \u0060believing maids\u0027 precludes unbelieving women, whom it is unlawful to marry, even if one should find no believing women and fear [the distress of fornication]; yet it is better for you to be patient, and abstain from marrying slavegirls, lest the child should become enslaved also. God is Forgiving, Merciful, by allowing room for manoeuvre in these matters.",
  "God desires to make clear to you, the laws of your religion and what is in your best interests, and to guide you in the ways, the paths, of those, prophets, before you, in the way of what is lawful and what is unlawful, so that you might follow them, and to turn [in forgiveness] towards you, bringing you back from the disobedience which you practised, to obedience to Him; God is Knowing, of you, Wise, in what He has ordained for you.",
  "And God desires to turn [forgivingly] towards you (He repeats this in order to expand upon it), but those who follow their passions, the Jews and Christians, or the Magians and adulterers, desire that you deviate with a terrible deviation, transgressing what is right by committing what has been forbidden you, so that you might be like them.",
  "God desires to lighten things for you, and make the rulings of the Law easier for you; for man was created weak, unable to abstain from women and passions.",

And kill not yourselves, by committing what leads towards destruction on account of some affiliation, be it in this world or the Hereafter.

  "And whoever does that, which he has been forbidden, through aggression (\u0060udwnan, a circumstantial qualifier), transgressing what is lawful, and injustice (zulman, [reiterated] for emphasis), him We shall certainly expose, admit, to a fire, wherein he shall burn; and that for God is an easy matter.",
  "If you avoid the grave sins that are forbidden you, those for which the threat of punishment has been prescribed, like murder, fornication or theft -- according to Ibn \u0060Abbs, these number as much as seven hundred -- We will absolve you of your, minor, evil deeds, on account of your acts of obedience, and admit you by an honourable gate (read mudkhalan or madkhalan), that is, [by an honourable] admittance or location, namely, Paradise.",

To men a share from, a reward for, what they have earned, for their acts in the struggle and so on, and to women a share from what they have earned, by way of being obedient to their spouses and guarding their private parts: this was revealed when Umm Salama said: \u0060Would that we were men, so that we could join the struggle and receive the reward they receive!\u0027 And ask (read wa-s\u0027al or wa-sal) God of His bounty, what you need and He will give it to you; God is ever Knower of all things, including where merit is deserved and that for which you ask.",

So give them, now, their share, their portions of the inheritance, which is a sixth. God is ever Witness over everything, [ever] aware [of it], including your circumstances: this verse was abrogated by His words, But those related by blood are nearer to one another [Q. 8:75 and 33:6].",
  "Men are in charge of, they have authority over, women, disciplining them and keeping them in check, because of that with which God has preferred the one over the other, that is, because God has given them the advantage over women, in knowledge, reason, authority and otherwise, and because of what they expend, on them [the women], of their property. Therefore righteous women, among them, are obedient, to their husbands, guarding in the unseen, that is, [guarding] their private parts and otherwise during their spouses\u0027 absence, because of what God has guarded, for them, when He enjoined their male spouses to look after them well. And those you fear may be rebellious, disobedient to you, when such signs appear, admonish them, make them fear God, and share not beds with them, retire to other beds if they manifest such disobedience, and strike them, but not violently, if they refuse to desist [from their rebellion] after leaving them [in separate beds]. If they then obey you, in what is desired from them, do not seek a way against them, a reason to strike them unjustly.

The two arbiters do their best and bid the one guilty of the injustice to desist, or they suggest separation if they see fit. God, exalted be He, says, if they, the two arbiters, desire to set things right, God will grant them, the married couple, success, determining for them what constitutes [an act of] obedience, be it reconciliation or separation.

If they had said, \u0060We have heard and obey\u0027, instead of \u0060And we disobey\u0027, and, only, \u0060Hear\u0027, and \u0060Consider us,\u0027 (unzur ilayn) instead of r\u0060in, it would have been better for them, than what they said, and more upright, more just than that, but God has cursed them, removing them from His mercy, for their unbelief, so they believe not except a few, among them, such as \u0060Abd Allh b. Salm and his companions.",
  "O you who have been given the Scripture, believe in what We have revealed, of the Qur\u0027n, confirming what is with you, of the Torah, before We obliterate faces, erasing the eyes, noses and eyebrows in them, and turn them inside out, and make them like the napes of the neck, a flat plate, or curse them, by transforming them into apes, as We cursed, [as] We transformed, those of the Sabbath, among them, and God\u0027s command, His decree, is done: after this was revealed, \u0060Abd Allh b. Salm converted to Islam, and so it was said that this had been a conditional threat of punishment, so that when some of them converted to Islam, it [the threat] was lifted. It is also said that obliteration and transformation will take place before the rising of the Hour.",
  "God forgives not that anything should be associated with Him. But He forgives other than, save, that, of sins, to whomever He wills, forgiveness for, by admitting him into Paradise without punishment. And whomever He wills of the believers He punishes for their sins, and then admits them into Paradise. Whoever associates anything with God, then he has indeed invented a tremendous, a great, sin.",
  "Have you not seen those who praise themselves for purity? namely, the Jews, when they say, \u0060We are God\u0027s children and His beloved\u0027, in other words, it is not a matter of their purifying themselves. Nay, God purifies whom He will, through faith, and they shall not be wronged, they shall not be diminished of their deeds, a single date-thread, as much as the peel on a date-stone.",
  "Consider, in amazement, how they invent falsehood against God, in that way, and that suffices for a clear, an evident, sin.",
  "The following was revealed regarding Ka\u0060b b. al-Ashraf and other such scholars from among the Jews, when they came to Mecca and saw those killed at Badr, and began to incite the idolaters to avenge them [their dead] by waging war against the Prophet (s): Have you not seen those who were given a share of the Book, how they believe in al-Jibt and al-Tght, two idols belonging to Quraysh, and say to the disbelievers, to Ab Sufyn and his companions, when they [the latter] said to them: \u0060Are we, who are the guardians of the House, who give drink to the pilgrim, offer hospitality to the guest, set free the captive, and do such and such ... not more rightly guided than Muhammad, he who has contravened the religion of his forefathers, severed the ties of kinship, and abandoned the Sanctuary?\u0027, \u0060These, in other words, you, are more rightly guided, upon a more upright way, than the believers\u0027?",
  "Those are the ones whom God has cursed; and he whom God has cursed, you will never find for him any helper, anyone to protect him from His chastisement.",
  "Or have they a share in the Kingdom?, that is to say, they have no share in it whatever, and even if they did, then they would not give the people a single date-spot, that is, [not even] something as worthless as the tiny spot on the back of a date-pit, because of the extent of their niggardliness.",
  "Or, nay, are they jealous of people, namely, of the Prophet (s), for the bounty that God has bestowed upon them, in the way of prophethood and abundance of women? In other words, they wish that he be deprived of such things, saying, \u0060If he were truly a prophet, he would not be concerned with women\u0027. For We gave the House of Abraham, his forefather, the likes of Moses, David and Solomon, the Book and wisdom, and prophethood, and We gave them a mighty kingdom: David had ninety�nine women, and Solomon had a thousand, free women and slavegirls.",
  "And there are some of them who believe in him, in Muhammad (s), and some of them who bar from him, [who] reject [him] and do not believe. Hell suffices for a blaze, as a chastisement for those who do not believe.",

Surely God is ever Mighty, nothing being beyond His power, Wise, in His creation.",
  "And those that believe, and perform righteous deeds, We shall admit them to Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide: they shall have therein spouses purified, of menstruation and every impurity, and We shall admit them to plenteous shade, that is everlasting [shade], never replaced by any sun, and this is the shade of Paradise.",
  "Verily, God commands you to restore trusts, that is, the rights entrusted [to you by others], back to their owners: this was revealed when \u0060Al, may God be pleased with him, took the key of the Ka\u0060ba from its keeper, \u0060Uthmn b. Talha al-Hajab, by force, upon the arrival of the Prophet (s) in Mecca in the year of the Conquest, after he [\u0060Uthmn] had tried to prevent him [\u0060Al from taking it] saying, \u0060If I had known that he was the Messenger of God, I would not have prevented him\u0027. The Messenger of God (s) then ordered him [\u0060Al] to give it back to him [\u0060Uthmn] saying to him, \u0060Here you are, [it is yours] now and always\u0027. He [\u0060Uthmn] was amazed by this, whereupon \u0060Al recited to him this verse, and he accepted Islam. Upon his death, he [\u0060Uthmn] gave it [the key] to his brother, Shayba, and thus it remained in [the keep of] his descendants. Although the verse was revealed regarding a specific occasion, it holds true in general on account of the plural person [to which it is addressed]. And when you judge between people, He commands, that you judge with justice. Excellent is (ni\u0060imm, the mm of ni\u0060ima has been assimilated with the indefinite particle m, which is the object described, in other words, na\u0060ima shay\u0027an, \u0060an excellent thing [is]\u0027) the admonition God gives you, to restore a trust and to judge with justice. God is ever Hearer, of what is said, Seer, of what is done.",
  "O you who believe, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you, that is, rulers, when they command you to obey God and His Messenger. If you should quarrel, disagree, about anything, refer it to God, that is, to His Book, and the Messenger, while he lives, and thereafter [refer] to his Sunna: in other words examine these [disputes] with reference to these two [sources], if you believe in God and the Last Day; that, reference to the two [sources], is better, for you than quarrelling or [adhering to] personal opinions, and more excellent in interpretation, in the end.",
  "The following verse was revealed when a Jew and a hypocrite fell into a dispute. The hypocrite called on Ka\u0060b b. al-Ashraf, to arbitrate between them, while the Jew called on the Prophet (s). When they came to him, the Prophet ruled in favour of the Jew. But the hypocrite was not satisfied, and so they went before \u0060Umar. The Jew told him what had happened, whereupon he [\u0060Umar] turned to the hypocrite and asked him, \u0060Is this true?\u0027, and when he replied, \u0060Yes\u0027, he [\u0060Umar] killed him. Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you, and what was revealed before you, desiring to take their disputes to a false deity (tght), one excessive in tempting [others] to falsehood (tughyn), namely, Ka\u0060b b. al-Ashraf, when they have been commanded to renounce him?, and not to associate with him. But Satan desires to mislead them, far astray, from the truth.",
  "And when it is said to them, \u0060Come to what God has revealed, as regards rulings in the Qur\u0027n, and the Messenger\u0027, that he may judge between you, you see the hypocrites turn away from you vehemently, to others.",
  "How would it be, [what] would they do, when an affliction, a punishment, befalls them for what their own hands have sent before them, of unbelief and acts of disobedience, that is to say, would they then be able to turn away and escape it? No! They then come to you (thumma j\u0027ka, a supplement to yasuddn, \u0060they turn away\u0027 [of the previous verse]), swearing by God that, in turning to other than you for arbitration, \u0060We sought only virtue, settlement, and harmony\u0027, reconciliation between the disputing parties by [any] approximate judgement without regard for the painful truth.",
  "Those -- God knows what is in their hearts, in the way of hypocrisy and the mendacity of their excuses; so turn away from them, with forgiveness, and admonish them, make them fear God, and say to them regarding, the issue of, their souls penetrating words, affecting them, in other words, reprimand them so that they repent of their unbelief.",
  "We never sent any Messenger, but that he should be obeyed, in what he commands and judges, by the leave, by the command, of God, and not that he should be disobeyed or opposed. If, when they had wronged themselves, by seeking the judgement of the false idol, they had come to you, repentant, and asked forgiveness from God, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them (there is a shift from the second [to the third] person in this address, in deference to his [the Prophet\u0027s (s)] status); they would have found God Relenting, to them, Merciful, to them.",
  "But no, (fa-l, the l is extra) by your Lord! They will not believe until they make you judge over what has broken out, has become mixed up, between them and find in themselves no inhibition, [no] constraint or doubt, regarding what you decide, but submit, [but] comply with your ruling, in full submission, without objection.",
  "And had We prescribed for them: (the particle an, \u0060that\u0027, is explicative) \u0060Slay yourselves\u0027 or \u0060Leave your habitations\u0027, as We did for the Children of Israel, they would not have done it, that is, what has been prescribed for them, save a few (read nominative qallun, as a substitution; or read accusative qallan, as an exceptive clause) of them; yet if they had done what they were admonished to do, of obedience to the Messenger (s), it would have been better for them, and stronger in establishing, [a stronger] confirmation of their faith.",
  "And then, that is, had they confirmed themselves, We would have surely given them from Us a great wage, that is, Paradise.",
  "And We would have guided them to a straight path. Some Companions said to the Prophet (s): \u0060How will we be able to see you in Paradise, when you will be in the highest stations and we will be lower than you?\u0027, and so the following was revealed:",
  "Whoever obeys God and the Messenger, in what he commands, they are with those whom God has blessed of the prophets and the truthful, that is, the most excellent of the Prophet\u0027s Companions, because of the fullness of their truthfulness and their affirmation of the truth; and the martyrs, those slain in the path of God; and the righteous, [all those] other than the ones mentioned. What fine companions they are!, in Paradise, since in it one will enjoy seeing them, visiting them and being in their presence, even though they will be in the highest stations in relation to others.",
  "That, namely, their being with those mentioned (dhlika, \u0060that\u0027, is the subject, the predicate of which is [the following]) is bounty from God, with which He has favoured them, and not because they have earned it through their obedience. God suffices as Knower, of the reward of the Hereafter, in other words, trust in what He has told you: None can tell you like One Who is aware [Q. 35:14].",
  "O you who believe, take your precautions, against your enemy, that is, be wary of him and be vigilant against him; then move forward, prepare to fight him, in companies, in separate groups, one raiding party followed by the next; or move forward all together, in one assembly.",
  "Verily, there are some of you who tarry, who indeed hesitate to join the fighting, such as \u0060Abd Allh b. Ubayy, the hypocrite, and his companions -- counting him [the one who tarries] as one of them [the Muslims] is from the perspective of outward appearances -- (the lm in the verb [la-yubatti\u0027anna, \u0060verily ... who tarry\u0027] is for oaths); then, if an affliction befalls you, such as slaughter or defeat, he says, \u0060God has been gracious to me, for I was not a witness with them\u0027, present [at the fighting], lest I should be hurt.",
  "But if (wa-la-in, the lm is for oaths) a bounty from God befalls you, such as a conquest or booty, he will surely cry, in regret, as if (ka\u0027an is softened, its subject having been omitted, in other words [it should be] ka\u0027annahu) there had never been (read lam yakun, or lam takun) any affection, any acquaintance or friendship, between you and him: this [statement] refers back to the words [in the previous verse] \u0060God has been gracious to me\u0027, and comes as a parenthesis between the statement \u0060that he will cry\u0027 and the very words he cries, which are: \u0060Oh (y, is for exclamation), would that I had been with them, so that I might have won a great triumph!\u0027, that is, [that] I might have taken a good share of the booty.",
  "God, exalted be He, says: So let them fight in the way of God, to elevate His religion, those who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter; and whoever fights in the way of God and is slain, dies a martyr, or conquers, overcomes his enemy, We shall give him a great wage, a plentiful reward.",
  "What is wrong with you, that you do not fight: this is an interrogative of rebuke, in other words, there is nothing to prevent you from fighting, in the way of God, and for, the deliverance of, the oppressed men, women, and children, whom the disbelievers persecuted and prevented from emigrating. Ibn \u0060Abbs, may God be pleased with him and his father, said, \u0060My mother and I were among them\u0027; who say, supplicating, \u0060O, our Lord, bring us forth from this town, Mecca, whose people are evildoers, through unbelief, and appoint for us a protector from You, to take charge of our affair, and appoint for us from You a helper\u0027, to defend us against them. God responded to their supplication and facilitated escape for some of them, while others remained behind until Mecca was conquered -- in charge of them the Prophet (s) placed \u0060Attb b. Asd, who proceeded to seek justice for the wronged from those that had wronged them.",
  "Those who believe fight in the way of God, and those who disbelieve fight in the way of a false deity, Satan. Fight therefore against the friends of Satan, the supporters of his religion and you will defeat them with the strength you draw from God; surely the plotting of Satan, against believers, is ever feeble, of no substance, and cannot stand up to God\u0027s plotting against the disbelievers.",
  "Have you not seen those to whom it was said, \u0060Restrain your hands, from fighting the disbelievers when they desired it at Mecca, because of the harm the disbelievers had inflicted upon them -- and these were a group from among the Companions -- and establish the prayer, and pay the alms\u0027? Then, as soon as fighting was prescribed, was made obligatory, for them, lo, a party of them fear people, the disbelievers, that is, [they fear] punishment at their hands through death, as they would fear, the punishment of, God, or with more fear, than their fear of Him (ashadda, \u0060more\u0027, is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier; the response to the lamm, \u0060as soon as\u0027, is indicated by idh, \u0060lo\u0027, and what follows), in other words, they are taken aback by fear, and they said, frightened of death, \u0060Our Lord, why have You prescribed fighting for us? Why not (lawl is [to be understood as] hall) defer us to a near term?\u0027 Say, to them: \u0060The enjoyment of this world, that which is enjoyed therein, or enjoying it [the world], is trifling, it will end up by perishing; and the Hereafter, Paradise, is better for him who fears God\u0027s punishment by avoiding disobedience to Him; and you shall not be wronged (l tuzlamna, may also be read l yuzlamna, \u0060they shall not be wronged\u0027) you shall not be diminished of your deeds, a single date-thread, as much as the peel on a date-stone, so struggle [in the way of God].",
  "Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, though you should be in raised-up, lofty, towers\u0027, forts, so do not shrink from fighting for fear of death. And if a good thing, such as fertility and abundance, befalls them, the Jews, they say, \u0060This is from God\u0027; but if an evil thing, such as drought or misfortune, befalls them, as it did with them when the Prophet (s) arrived in Medina, they say, \u0060This is from you\u0027, O Muhammad (s), that is, from the bad luck [you bring]. Say, to them: \u0060Everything, good and evil, is from God.\u0027 What is wrong with this people that they do not understand, that is, they do not come close to comprehending, any words, delivered to them (the m, \u0060what\u0027 [of m li-h\u0027l\u0027, \u0060what is wrong with these\u0027] is an interrogative intended to provoke amazement at their extreme ignorance; to state that one cannot even come close to doing something is [rhetorically] more intense than saying that he cannot do it).",
  "Whatever good (hasana means khayr) befalls you, O man, it is from God, it has come to you from His bounty; whatever evil, misfortune, befalls you is from yourself, it has come to you as a necessary consequence of sins you have committed. We have sent you, O Muhammad (s), to people as a messenger (raslan, is a circumstantial qualifier for emphasis), and God suffices as Witness, of your Mission.",
  "Whoever obeys the Messenger, verily obeys God; and whoever turns his back, [whoever] avoids obedience to you, do not be concerned with them: We have not sent you as a watcher over them, to keep watch over their deeds, but as a warner. Their affair is Ours [to deal with] and We will requite them. This [statement] was before the command to fight [them was revealed].",
  "They say, that is, the hypocrites [say] when they come to you, \u0060Our affair is [all about] Obedience, to you\u0027; but when they sally forth, [when] they depart, from you, a party of them harbour (the [final] t\u0027 [of the feminine-ending in bayyatat, \u0060harbour\u0027] can either be elided with the following t\u0027 [of t\u0027ifa, \u0060a party\u0027] or simply omitted) they entertain secretly [feelings], other than what they say, to you in your presence in the way of [their] obedience, in other words, [they hide] disobedience to you. God writes down, He commands that it be written, what they harbour, in their scrolls [of deeds], so that they will be requited for it. So turn away from them, in forgiveness, rely on God, put your trust in Him, for He will suffice you; and God suffices as a Guardian, to Whom matters are entrusted.",
  "What, do they not ponder, do they [not] contemplate, the Qur\u0027n?, and the marvellous truths contained in it. If it had been from other than God surely they would have found therein much inconsistency, [much] contradiction in meaning and irregularity in arrangement.",
  "And when there comes to them an issue, [news] concerning the raiding parties sent by the Prophet (s) and what has happened to them, be it of security, through victory, or of fear, through defeat, they broadcast it, they make it widely-known: this was revealed regarding a group from among the hypocrites, or from among the feeble believers, who used to do this, and so the hearts of the believers would lose courage and the Prophet (s) would become distressed. If they had referred it, the news, to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, that is, the judicious elders among the Companions, in other words, if they had kept quiet about it until they were fully informed; those among them who are able to think it out, [those who] follow it up and seek knowledge of it, the ones who broadcast it, would have known it, and whether it is a matter that ought be broadcast or not, from them, from the Prophet (s) and those of authority. And but for the bounty of God to you, through Islam, and His mercy, to you through the Qur\u0027n, you would surely have followed Satan, in the abominations to which he commands you, except a few [of you].",
  "So fight, O Muhammad (s), in the way of God; you are charged only with yourself, so do not be concerned with their failing to join you, the meaning being: fight, even if you are on your own, for you have been promised victory. And urge on the believers, incite them to fight and make them desire it; maybe God will restrain the might, the war, of the disbelievers; God is mightier, than them, and more severe in castigation, in punishment, than them. And so the Messenger of God (s) said: \u0060By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, I shall sally forth [to fight], even if [I go] alone\u0027. Thereupon, he sallied forth with seventy cavalrymen to the first [battle at] Badr, where God restrained the might of the disbelievers by casting terror into their hearts and preventing Ab Sufyn from sallying forth, as has already been mentioned in [srat] l \u0060Imrn [Q. 3:151].",
  "Whoever intercedes, between people, with a good intercession, one in accordance with the Law, shall receive a share of, the reward for, it, because of it; and whoever intercedes with an evil intercession, one in contravention of it [the Law], shall receive the like, the share of the sin, from it, because of it. God conserves, He has power over, all things, and so requites every person according to his deeds.",
  "And when you are greeted with a greeting, as when it is said to you, \u0060Peace be upon you\u0027, greet, the one that greeted you, with better than it, by responding to him with, \u0060Peace be upon you, and God\u0027s mercy and blessings\u0027, or return it, by saying back to him what he said; in other words, it is a duty to greet in one of these two ways, the former being the preferred one. Surely God keeps count of, He holds [you] accountable for, all things, and requites accordingly, including things such as returning a greeting. The Sunna specifies that one should not return the greeting of an disbeliever, an innovator, a wicked person, and of the one that greets a person who is in the act of relieving himself, or one in the bath, or one eating -- indeed it is actually disapproved with the exception of the last. To the disbeliever [who says \u0060peace be upon you\u0027] one should simply say, \u0060And upon you\u0027.",
  "God -- there is no god except Him, and by God, He will surely gather you, from your graves, to, on, the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt, no uncertainty. And who is truer in statement, in speech, than God?, that is, no one is.",
  "When a group retreated from Uhud, people were at variance over their status. Some said, \u0060Let us slay them\u0027, while others said, \u0060No!\u0027 So the following was revealed: What is wrong with you, what is the matter with you, that you have become two parties, two groups, regarding the hypocrites, when God has overthrown them, He has turned them back [to disbelief], for what they earned?, in the way of disbelief and acts of disobedience. What, do you desire to guide him whom God has sent astray?, that is, to count them among the guided (the interrogative in both places is for disapproval). And he whom God sends astray, you will never find for him a way, a path to guidance.",
  "They long, they wish, that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve, so then you, and they, would be equal, in unbelief; therefore do not take friends from among them, associating with them, even if they should [outwardly] manifest belief, until they emigrate in the way of God, a proper emigration that would confirm their belief; then, if they turn away, and remain upon their ways, take them, as captives, and slay them wherever you find them; and do not take any of them as a patron, to associate with, or as a helper, to assist you against your enemy.",
  "Except those who attach themselves to, [who] seek refuge with, a people between whom and you there is a covenant, a pledge of security for them and for whoever attaches himself to them, in the manner of the Prophet\u0027s (s) covenant with Hill b. \u0060Uwaymir al-Aslam; or, those who, come to you with their breasts constricted, dejected, about the prospect of fighting you, [being] on the side of their people, or fighting their people, siding with you, in other words, [those who come to you] refraining from fighting either you or them, then do not interfere with them, neither taking them as captives nor slaying them: this statement and what follows was abrogated by the \u0060sword\u0027 verse. Had God willed, to give them sway over you, He would have given them sway over you, by strengthening their hearts, so that assuredly they would have fought you: but God did not will it and so He cast terror into their hearts. And so if they stay away from you and do not fight you, and offer you peace, reconciliation, that is, [if] they submit, then God does not allow you any way against them, [He does not allow you] a means to take them captive or to slay them.",
  "You will find others desiring to have security from you, by manifesting belief before you, and security from their own people, through unbelief, when they return to them, and these were [the tribes of] Asad and Ghatafn; yet whenever they are returned to sedition, [whenever] they are summoned to idolatry, they are overwhelmed by it, falling into it in the worst of ways. So, if they do not stay away from you, by refraining from fighting you, and, do not, offer you peace, and, do not, restrain their hands, from you, then take them, as captives, and slay them wherever you come upon them, [wherever] you find them; against them We have given you clear warrant, a clear and manifest proof for you to slay them and capture them, on account of their treachery.",
  "It is not for a believer to slay a believer, in other words, no such slaying should result at his hands, except by mistake, killing him by mistake, unintentionally. He who slays a believer by mistake, when he meant to strike some other thing, as in the case of hunting or [shooting at] trees, but then happens to strike him with what in most cases would not kill, then let him set free, let him emancipate, a believing slave (raqaba denotes nasama, \u0060a person\u0027), an obligation on him, and blood-money is to be submitted, to be paid, to his family, that is, the slain person\u0027s inheritors, unless they remit it as a charity, to him by waiving [their claim to] it. In the Sunna this [blood-money] is explained as being equivalent to one hundred camels: twenty pregnant, twenty female sucklings, twenty male sucklings, twenty mature ones and twenty young ones [not more than five years old]; and [the Sunna stipulates] that it is incumbent upon the killer\u0027s clan, namely, his paternal relations [and not other relatives]. They share this [burden of the blood-money] over three years; the rich among them pays half a dinar, while the one of moderate means [pays] a quarter of a dinar each year; if they still cannot meet this, then it can be taken from the treasury, and if this is not possible, then from the killer himself. If he, the slain, belongs to a people at enmity, at war, with you and is a believer, then the setting free of a believing slave, is incumbent upon the slayer, as a redemption, but no bloodmoney is to be paid to his family, since they are at war [with you]. If he, the slain, belongs to a people between whom and you there is a covenant, a treaty, as is the case with the Protected People (ahl al-dhimma), then the blood-money, for him, must be paid to his family, and it constitutes a third of the blood-money for a believer, if the slain be a Jew or a Christian, and two thirds of a tenth of it, if he be a Magian; and the setting free of a believing slave, is incumbent upon the slayer. But if he has not the wherewithal, for [setting free] a slave, failing to find one, or the means to obtain one, then the fasting of two successive months, is incumbent upon him as a redemption: here God does not mention the transition to [an alternative to fasting which is] giving food [to the needy], as in the case of [repudiating one\u0027s wife by] zihr, something which al- Shfi\u0060 advocates in the more correct of two opinions of his; a relenting from God (tawbatan, \u0060relenting\u0027, is the verbal noun, and is in the accusative because of the implied verb). And God is ever Knowing, of His creation, Wise, in what He has ordained for them.",
  "And whoever slays a believer deliberately, intending to kill him, with something that is lethal, aware of the fact that he [the slain] is a believer, his requital is Hell, abiding therein, and God is wroth with him and has cursed him, He has removed him from His mercy, and has prepared for him a mighty chastisement, in the Fire: this may be explained as [referring to] the person that deems such [killing] licit, or as being his requital if he were to be requited, but it would not be anything new if this threat [of punishment] were to be forgone, because of what He says: Other than that [that is, idolatry] He forgives whomever He will [Q. 4:48]. It is reported from Ibn \u0060Abbs that it [the verse] should be understood as it stands, abrogating other verses of \u0060forgiveness\u0027. The verse in [srat] al-Baqara [Q. 2:178] clearly indicates that the one who kills deliberately should be killed in return, or if he is pardoned then he has to pay the blood-money, the value of which has already been mentioned. It is made clear in the Sunna that between the intentional and the unintentional, there is a type of killing that is identified as [being with] quasi-deliberate intent (shibh al- \u0060amd), where the killer has slain with what in most cases is not [a] lethal [implement]. In such a case, there is no [right to] retaliation and blood-money is paid instead, so that it [this type of killing] is described as intentional, but [considered] unintentional in [that there applies] the fixing of the period [for payment] and the sharing of the burden [by the killer\u0027s clan]; in this [case] and that of intentional killing redemption is more urgent than in unintentional killing.",
  "The following was revealed when a group from among the Companions passed by a man from the Ban Sulaym driving his flock of sheep, and he offered them a greeting of peace. But they said, \u0060He only greeted us dissimulating, out of fear\u0027. So they killed him and took away his flock: O you who believe, when you are going forth, travelling in order to struggle, in the way of God, be discriminating (fa-tabayyan; a variant reading has fa-tathabbat, \u0060ascertain\u0027, here and further below); and do not say to him who offers you peace (read al-salm or al-salam), that is, the greeting, or [offers you] submission, declaring the profession of faith (shahda), which is an indication of being a Muslim: \u0060You are not a believer: you are only saying this to dissimulate for fear of your life and property\u0027, so that you then end up killing him, desiring, seeking by this, the transient goods of the life of this world, that is, its enjoyment, in the way of spoils. With God are plenteous spoils, rendering you free of the need to kill such a person for his property. So you were formerly, when your lives and property were protected simply upon your professing the faith; but God has been gracious to you, making you known for your faith and uprightness. So be discriminating, lest you kill a believer and treat those entering the religion as you were treated [formerly]. Surely God is ever Aware of what you do, and will requite you for it.",
  "The believers who sit at home, away from the struggle, other than those who have an injury, such as a chronic illness or blindness or the like (read in the nominative, ghayru l l-darar, \u0060other than those who have an injury\u0027, as an adjectival clause; or in the accusative, ghayra l l-darar, as an exceptive clause) are not the equals of those who struggle in the way of God with their possessions and their lives. God has preferred those who struggle with their possessions and their lives over the ones who sit at home, on account of some injury, by a degree, by [a degree of] merit, since both have the same intention, but the extra degree is given to those who have carried out the struggle; yet to each, of the two groups, God has promised the goodly reward, Paradise, and God has preferred those who struggle over the ones who sit at home, without any injury, with a great reward (ajran \u0060azman, is substituted by [the following, darajtin minhu]),",
  "degrees, that is, stations one higher than the other in honour, from Him, and forgiveness and mercy (maghfiratan and rahmatan are in the accusative because [they constitute an object] of the implied verb [faddala, \u0060He has preferred\u0027]). Surely God is ever Forgiving, to His friends, Merciful, to those that obey Him.",
  "The following was revealed regarding a group of people who submitted to Islam but did not emigrate and were then slain in the battle of Badr alongside the disbelievers: And those whom the angels take [in death], while they are wronging their souls, having remained among the disbelievers and neglected to emigrate, the angels will say, to them in rebuke: \u0060What was your predicament?\u0027, in other words, \u0060in what circumstances were you with regard to your religion\u0027. They will say, giving excuses, \u0060We were oppressed, unable to establish religion, in the land\u0027, the land of Mecca. The angels will say, to them in rebuke: \u0060But was not God\u0027s earth spacious that you might have emigrated therein?\u0027, from the land of unbelief to another land, as others did? God, exalted be He, says: as for such, their abode shall be Hell -- an evil journey\u0027s end, it is!",
  "Except the oppressed among the men, women, and children who are unable to devise a plan, having no strength to emigrate and no substance, and are not guided to a way, a means [of going] to the land of emigration.",
  "As for such, perhaps God will pardon them, for God is ever Pardoning, Forgiving.",
  "Whoever emigrates in the way of God will find in the earth many refuges, places of emigration, and abundance, of provision; whoever goes forth from his house as an emigrant to God and His Messenger, and then death overtakes him, along the way, as occurred with Junda\u0060 [or Jundab] b. Damra al-Layth, his wage is then incumbent upon, fixed [with], God; surely God is ever Forgiving, Merciful.",
  "And when you are going forth, travelling, in the land you would not be at fault if you shorten the prayer, by making it two [genuflexions] instead of four, if you fear that you may be afflicted by those who do not believe, that is, [if you fear] that you may be harmed [by them]: this [fear of affliction at the hands of the disbelievers] is [just intended as] an explication of the reality [of the situation] at that time and the point no longer applies. In the Sunna, it is pointed out that \u0060travel\u0027 (safar) means long-distance [travel], which is [approximately] 50 miles. God\u0027s words \u0060you would not be at fault\u0027 should be understood as [denoting] a dispensation and not a requirement, and this is the opinion of al-Shfi\u0060; the disbelievers are a manifest foe to you, their enmity being evident.",
  "When you, O Muhammad (s), are, present, among them, while you [all] fear an enemy, and you stand to lead them in prayer (this type of address is customary in the Qur\u0027n), let a party of them stand with you, while another party stand back, and let them, the party standing with you, take their weapons, with them. Then when they have performed their prostrations, that is, [when] they have prayed, let them, the other party, be behind you, on guard until you complete the prayers; thereupon, let this party go on guard, and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with you, taking their precautions and their weapons, with them until you have completed the prayers. The Prophet (s) did this once at Batn Nakhla, as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim]. The disbelievers wish, when you have stood up to pray, that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage that they may descend upon you all at once, by making an assault against you and capturing you, and herein is the reasoning behind keeping weapons on oneself. You are not at fault, if rain bothers you, or if you are sick, to lay aside your weapons, and not carry them: this implies that when there is no such excuse, it is compulsory to carry them, and this is one of two opinions held by al-Shfi\u0060 [on this matter]; the other [opinion] is that this [precaution] constitutes a sunna, and this is the more preferable opinion. But take your precautions, against the enemy and be on your guard as best you can; God has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating chastisement.",
  "When you have performed the prayer, [when] you have completed it, remember God, by [repeating] \u0060There is no god but God\u0027 (tahll) and \u0060Glory be to God\u0027 (tasbh), standing and sitting and on your sides, lying down, in other words, in all states. Then, when you are reassured, [when] you are secure, observe the prayer, perform it with its proper due, surely the prayer is for believers a prescription, enjoined, that is, an obligation, at specific times, that is, its appointed times are set, and so it should not be postponed from these times.",
  "After they returned from Uhud, the Prophet (s) dispatched a group to seek out Ab Sufyn and his companions, but they complained about their wounds, and the following was revealed: Be not faint, [be not] weak, in seeking, in pursuing, the enemy, the disbelievers, in order to fight them; if you are suffering, [if] you have pains from a wound, they are also suffering as you are suffering, that is, just like you, yet they do not shrink from fighting you; and you hope from God, in the way of victory and the reward for it, that for which they cannot hope, and since you have this advantage over them, you should be more willing for it than them. God is ever Knower, of all things, Wise, in His actions.",
  "Tu\u0060ma b. Ubayriq stole a coat of mail and hid it with a Jew. When it was discovered with the latter, Tu\u0060ma accused him of having stolen it, and swore by God that he [Tu\u0060ma] had not stolen it, and his clan asked the Prophet (s) to advocate on his behalf and absolve him, whereupon the following was revealed: Surely We have revealed to you the Book, the Qur\u0027n, with the truth (bi\u0027l-haqq is semantically connected to anzaln, \u0060We have revealed\u0027) so that you may judge between people by that which God has shown you, what God has taught you. And do not be a disputant for traitors, like Tu\u0060ma, disputing on their behalf.",
  "And pray for forgiveness from God, for that which you considered doing; surely God is ever Forgiving, Merciful.",
  "And do not dispute on behalf of those who betray themselves, through acts of disobedience, for the evil consequences of their betrayal shall fall on them; surely God loves not one who is treacherous, frequently betraying, and sinful, that is to say, He will punish him.",
  "They, the likes of Tu\u0060ma and his clan, hide themselves, in shame, from people, but they do not hide themselves from God; for He is with them, in His knowledge [of them], while they plot, they conspire, at night with discourse displeasing to Him, in their resolve to swear by God and deny the theft and accuse the Jew of it. God is ever Encompassing, in knowledge, of what they do.",
  "Ah! There you are (addressing Tu\u0060ma\u0027s clan) you have contested, you have disputed, on their behalf, that is to say, on behalf of Tu\u0060ma and his men (a variant reading has \u0060anhu, \u0060on his behalf\u0027) in the life of this world; but who will contest against God on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection, if He were to punish them, or who will be a guardian for them, and take charge of their affair or defend them? In other words, no one will do such a thing.",
  "Whoever does evil, [commits] a sin by which another is harmed, as when Tu\u0060ma falsely accused the Jew, or wrongs himself, committing a sin [the consequences of which are] limited to him, and then prays for God\u0027s forgiveness, for it, that is to say, [and then] he repents, he shall find God is Forgiving, Merciful, to him.",
  "And whoever commits a sin commits it against himself only, since the evil consequences fall on him, harming no one else; and God is ever Knower, Wise, in His actions.",
  "And whoever commits a mistake, a minor sin, or a sin, a grave sin, and then casts it upon the innocent, [one who is innocent] of it, he has thereby burdened himself with calumny, by his false accusation, and a manifest sin, [one which is] evident on account of what he has committed.",
  "Were it not for God\u0027s bounty to you, O Muhammad (s), and His mercy, by way of protecting you, a party of them, of Tu\u0060ma\u0027s clan, would have intended, [would have] conspired, to lead you astray, from judging with truth by deceiving you; but they lead only themselves astray; they will not hurt you at all, since the evil consequence of their leading you astray would have fallen on them. God has revealed to you the Book, the Qur\u0027n, and wisdom, the rulings contained therein, and He has taught you what you did not know, of rulings and the Unseen; and God\u0027s bounty to you, in this and other respects, is ever great.",

And whoever does that, the aforementioned, desiring, seeking, God\u0027s good pleasure, [and] nothing else of the affairs of this world, We shall surely give him (read nu\u0027thi or yu\u0027thi, \u0060He will give him\u0027, that is, \u0060God [will give him]\u0027) a great wage.",
  "But whoever makes a breach with, [whoever] opposes, the Messenger, in the truth that he brings, after guidance has become clear to him, [after] the truth has become manifest to him through miracles, and follows, a path, other than the way of the believers, that is to say, [other than] the path they follow in religion, by disbelieving, We shall turn him over to what he has turned to, We shall make him a leader of the misguidance which he has followed, by leaving this as it is between them in this world, and We shall expose him, We shall admit him in the Hereafter, in Hell, where he will burn -- an evil journey\u0027s end, an [evil] return it is.",

  "And I will surely lead them astray, from truth with evil whisperings, and surely I will fill them with desires, I shall cast into their hearts [thoughts] that life will endure, that there will be no resurrection and no reckoning; and surely I will command them and they will cut up the cattle\u0027s ears, and this was done to the [she-camels they called] bah\u0027ir. And surely I will command them and they will change God\u0027s creation\u0027, [substituting] His religion with unbelief, making lawful what God has made unlawful and making unlawful what God has made lawful. And whoever takes Satan for a patron, following him and obeying him, instead of God, has surely suffered a manifest loss, [one that is] evident, since he will end up in the Fire, made perpetual for him.",
  "He promises them, long life, and fills them with desires, of attaining their hopes in this world, and that there will be neither resurrection nor requital; but what Satan promises them, therewith, is only delusion, falsehood.",

  "When the Muslims and the People of the Scripture began to pride themselves [upon God\u0027s promise] the following was revealed: It, this matter, is not, dependent upon, your desires nor the desires of the People of the Scripture, but upon righteous deeds. Whoever does evil shall be requited for it, either in the Hereafter or in this life through trials and tribulations, as is stated in hadth; and he will not find besides God, that is, other than Him, any friend, to protect him, or helper, to defend him against Him.",

  "And who, that is, [and] none, is fairer in religion than he who submits his purpose, that is, [than he who] is compliant and offers his deeds sincerely, to God and is virtuous, [and] declares God\u0027s Oneness, and who follows the creed of Abraham, the one that is in accordance with the creed of Islam, as a hanf? (hanfan is a circumstantial qualifier), that is to say, [one] inclining away from all religions to the upright religion.

Say, to them: \u0060God pronounces to you concerning them, and what is recited to you in the Book, the Qur\u0027n, in the \u0060inheritance\u0027 verse [Q. 4:11], and He also pronounces to you, concerning the orphan women to whom you do not give what is prescribed, [what] is obligatory, for them, of inheritance, for you, O guardians, [who] desire, not, to marry them, because of their ugliness, and you prevent them from marrying [others], coveting their inheritance: in other words, God pronounces to you not to do this; and, concerning, the oppressed, young, children, that you give them what is their due, and, He also commands you, that you deal justly, equitably, with orphans, with respect to inheritance and dowry. Whatever good you do, God is ever Knower of it\u0027, and He will requite you for it.",
  "And if a woman (wa-in imra\u0027atun is in the nominative because of [it being the subject of] the explicative verb [that follows]) fears, anticipates, from her husband ill-treatment, if he looks down on her by refraining to sleep with her or by not maintaining her adequately, because he is averse to her and aspires to one more beautiful than her, or rejection, turning his face away from her, they are not at fault if they are reconciled through some agreement, in terms of shares and maintenance expenses, so that she concedes something to him in return for continuing companionship; if she agrees to this [then that is fine], but if [she does] not, then the husband must either give her all her due, or part with her (an yasslah, \u0060they reconcile\u0027: the original t\u0027 [of yataslah] has been assimilated with the sd; a variant reading has an yuslih, from [the fourth form] aslaha); reconciliation is better, than separation, ill-treatment or rejection. God, exalted be He, in explaining the natural disposition of man, says: But greed has been made present in the souls (al-shuhh is extreme niggardliness), meaning that they have a natural propensity for this, as if they [the souls] are ever in its presence, never absent from it. The meaning is: a woman would scarcely allow [another] to share her husband with her, and a man would scarcely allow her [to enjoy] him if he were to fall in love with another. If you are virtuous, in your conjugal life with women, and fear, being unjust to them, surely God is ever aware of what you do, and He will requite you for it.",
  "You will never be able to be just to, to treat equally, your wives, in terms of love, even if you be eager, for this; yet do not turn altogether away, towards the one you love with respect to the shares and maintenance expenses, so that you leave her, the one from whom you turn away, like one suspended, one that is neither a slavegirl nor a woman with a husband. If you set things right, by being just with the shares, and fear, injustice, surely God is ever Forgiving, regarding the inclination in your hearts, Merciful, to you in this respect.",
  "But if they, the married couple, separate, by way of divorce, God will compensate each of them, [from the need] of the other, out of His plenty, that is, out of His bounty, by giving her another as husband, and giving him another as wife. God is ever Embracing, of His creatures in bounty, Wise, in what He has ordained for them.",
  "To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth.

And We said to them and to you: \u0060If you disbelieve, in what you have been charged with, then to God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth\u0027, as creatures, possessions and servants, and He will not be harmed by your disbelief: God is ever Independent, of the need for His creation or their worship, Praised, praise-worthy for what He does with them.",
  "To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth (He has repeated this in order to reaffirm [the reason] why fear of God is necessary); God suffices as a Guardian, witnessing the fact that what is contained in them belongs to Him.",
  "If He will, He can remove you, O people, and bring others, instead of you, surely God is ever able to do that.",
  "Whoever desires, by his deeds, the reward of this world, then God has the reward of this world and of the Hereafter, for the one who wants it, and no one else has it, so why do any of you demand the lower [reward]? Why do you not seek the higher one, by devoting yourself sincerely to Him, since what [reward] he seeks can only be found with Him; God is ever Hearer, Seer.",
  "O you who believe, be upright in justice; witnesses, of the truth, for God, even though it, the witnessing, be against yourselves, so be witness against them [your selves] by affirming the truth and not concealing it; or, against, parents and kinsmen, whether the person, witnessed against, be rich or poor; God is closer to the two, than you and He has better knowledge of what is good for them. So do not follow any whim, in your testimonies by being partial to the rich one, seeking his pleasure, or [by being partial] to the poor one out of compassion for him, lest you swerve, so that you do not incline away from the truth, for if you twist (a variant reading [for talww] has tal) [if] you distort your testimony, or refrain, from giving it, surely God is ever aware of what you do, and will requite you accordingly.",
  "O you who believe, believe, with perseverance, in God and His Messenger and the Book which has been revealed to His Messenger, Muhammad (s), and that is the Qur\u0027n; and the Book which was revealed before, to the messengers, namely, the scriptures (a variant reading [for nuzzila and unzila, \u0060was revealed\u0027] has the active form for both verbs [nazzala and anzala, \u0060He revealed\u0027]). And whoever disbelieves in God and His angels and His Books, and His messengers, and the Last Day, verily he has strayed far away, from the truth.",
  "Verily, those who believed, in Moses, namely, the Jews, and then disbelieved, by worshipping the calf, and then believed, after that, and then disbelieved, in Jesus, and then increased in disbelief, in Muhammad -- it was not for God to forgive them, for what they have persisted in [of disbelief], nor to guide them to a way, to the truth.",

  "Those who (alladhna, is either a substitution for, or an adjectival qualification of, al-munfiqna, \u0060the hypocrites\u0027) take disbelievers for friends instead of believers, because they mistakenly believe them to be strong -- do they desire, [do] they seek, power with them? (an interrogative of disavowal), that is to say, they shall not find such [power] with them. Truly, power belongs altogether to God, in this world and the Hereafter, and none but His friends shall attain it.",
  "It has been revealed (read active nazzala, \u0060He has revealed\u0027, or passive nuzzila, \u0060It has been revealed\u0027) to you in the Book, in the Qur\u0027n, in srat al-An\u0060m [Q. 6:68], that: (an has been softened and its subject omitted, in other words, [read it as] annahu) \u0060When you hear God\u0027s signs, the Qur\u0027n, being disbelieved in and mocked, do not sit with them, that is, the disbelievers and the mockers, until they engage in some other talk, for otherwise you, if you were to sit with them, would surely be like them\u0027, in sinfulness. God will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers, all together, into Hell, just as they were gathered together in this world in unbelief and mockery.",
  "Those who (alladhna, substitutes for the previous alladhna [of verse 139]) wait in watch for you, [hoping] for misfortunes [to befall you], and, if a victory, such as a conquest or booty, comes to you from God, say, to you: \u0060Were we not with you?\u0027, in religion and in the struggle? So give us from the booty; but if the disbelievers have some luck, by gaining a victory over you, they say, to them: \u0060Did we not gain mastery, authority, over you, capable of capturing you and slaying you, but we spared you, and did we not defend you against the believers?\u0027, lest they be victorious over you, by forsaking them and apprising you of their plans, and thus have we not done you a favour? God, exalted be He, says: God will judge between you, and them, on the Day of Resurrection, admitting you into Paradise and them into the Fire; and God will never grant the disbelievers a way, a means [to success], over the believers, by annihilating them.",
  "The hypocrites seek to trick God, by manifesting the opposite of what they hide in themselves of unbelief, in order to escape His rulings in this world; but He is tricking them, He will requite them for their trickery, and so they will be disgraced in this world through God apprising His Prophet of what they hide, and punished in the Hereafter. When they stand up to pray, with the believers, they stand up lazily, reluctantly, and, for their prayers, to be seen by people, and they do not remember, pray [to], God save a little, for ostentation.",
  "Wavering, hesitant, all the time, between that unbelief and belief -- not, belonging, to these, disbelievers, neither to those, believers; and he whom God sends astray, you will never find for him a way, a path [back] to guidance.",
  "O you who believe, take not the disbelievers as friends instead of the believers: do you desire to give God over you, by your taking them as friends, a clear warrant?, a manifest proof of your hypocrisy?",
  "Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest level, place, of the Fire, that is, its bottom; and you will never find a helper for them, anyone to guard them from the Fire.",
  "Save those who repent, of hypocrisy, and make amends, in their deeds, and hold fast to, put their trust [in], God and make their religion purely God\u0027s, free from any pretence; those are with the believers, in terms of what they shall be given; and God will certainly give the believers a great wage, in the Hereafter, and that is Paradise.",
  "Why would God chastise you if you are thankful, of His favours, and believe, in Him? (the interrogative is meant as a denial, in other words: He would not punish you). God is ever Thankful, of the deeds of believers, rewarding them, Knowing, of His creation.",
  "God does not like the utterance of evil words out loud, by any person, that is to say, He will punish him for it, unless a person has been wronged, in which case He would not punish him for uttering it out loud, when he is informing [others] of the wrong done to him by the wrong-doer or summoning [them] against him. God is ever Hearer, of what is said, Knower, of what is done.",

God is ever Forgiving, to His friends, Merciful, to those who obey Him.",
  "The People of the Scripture, the Jews, will ask of you, O Muhammad (s), to cause a Book to be revealed to them from the heaven, all at once, as was revealed to Moses, merely to harass [you]. If you consider this shocking, then [know that], they, their forefathers, asked Moses for something greater than that, for they said, \u0060Show us God openly\u0027, before our eyes; so the thunderbolt, death, seized them, as punishment for them, for their evildoing, when they harassed him [Moses] with this demand. They then took to themselves the [golden] calf, for a god, after clear proofs, the miracles testifying to God\u0027s Oneness, had come to them; yet We pardoned that, and did not annihilate them; and We bestowed upon Moses clear authority, evident and manifest sway over them, for when he commanded them to slay themselves in repentance, they obeyed him.",
  "And We raised above them the Mount, by the covenant with them, that is, on account of the covenant made with them, that they might fear, and so they accepted it; and We said to them, while it cast a shadow [hovering] above them: \u0060Enter the gate, the gate of the town, bowing\u0027; and We said to them, \u0060Transgress not (a variant reading [of l ta\u0060d] is l ta\u0060add, where the original t\u0027 [of l tata\u0060add] is assimilated with the dl, in other words [it is similar in meaning to] l ta\u0060tad, \u0060do not act unjustly [in]\u0027) the Sabbath\u0027, by fishing during it, and We took from them a firm covenant, over this, but they broke it.",
  "So, for their breaking (fa-bi-m naqdihim: the m is extra; the b\u0027 is causative and connected to a missing element [such as sabab, \u0060reason\u0027], in other words [it should be understood as] la\u0060annhum bi-sabab naqdihim, \u0060We cursed them for the reason of their breaking\u0027) their covenant and disbelieving in the signs of God, and slaying the prophets wrongfully, and for their saying, to the Prophet (s): \u0060Our hearts are covered up\u0027, and cannot grasp what you say -- nay, but God sealed them for their disbelief, and so they cannot heed any admonition; so they do not believe, except for a few, among them, like \u0060Abd Allh b. Salm and his companions.",
  "And for their disbelief, a second time, in Jesus (the b\u0027 [of bi-kufrihim, \u0060for their disbelief\u0027] is repeated in order to separate it [\u0060their disbelief\u0027 in Jesus] from what is supplemented to it [\u0060their utterance against Mary\u0027]) and their uttering against Mary a tremendous calumny, when they accused her of fornication.",
  "And for their saying, boastfully, \u0060We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, the Messenger of God\u0027, as they claim: in other words, for all of these [reasons] We have punished them. God, exalted be He, says, in repudiating their claim to have killed him: And yet they did not slay him nor did they crucify him, but he, the one slain and crucified, who was an associate of theirs [the Jews], was given the resemblance, of Jesus. In other words, God cast his [Jesus\u0027s] likeness to him and so they thought it was him [Jesus]. And those who disagree concerning him, that is, concerning Jesus, are surely in doubt regarding, the slaying of, him, for some of them said, when they saw the slain man: the face is that of Jesus, but the body is not his, and so it is not he; and others said: no, it is he. They do not have any knowledge of, the slaying of, him, only the pursuit of conjecture (ill ittib\u0060a l-zann, is a discontinuous exception) in other words: \u0060instead, they follow conjecture regarding him, that which they imagined [they saw]\u0027; and they did not slay him for certain (yaqnan, a circumstantial qualifier emphasising the denial of the slaying).",

God is ever Mighty, in His kingdom, Wise, in His actions.",
  "When the Jews were asked about his [Muhammad\u0027s] prophethood (s) and they denied him, the following was revealed: But God bears witness, He makes clear [the truth of] your prophethood, with what He has revealed to you, of the miraculous Qur\u0027n; He has revealed it, enveloped, through His knowledge, that is, [He has revealed it] knowing it fully, or [He has revealed it] with His knowledge therein; and the angels also bear witness, to you; and God suffices as a Witness, to this.",

  "O People of the Scripture, the Gospel, do not go to extremes, do not go beyond the bounds, in your religion and do not say about God except, the saying of, the truth, such as exalting Him above any associations with a partner or a child: the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, was only the Messenger of God, and His Word which He cast to, [which] He conveyed to, Mary, and a spirit, that is, one whose spirit is, from Him: he [Jesus] is here attached to God, exalted be He, as an honouring for him, and not as you claim, that he is the son of God, or a god alongside Him, or one of three, because one that possesses a spirit is compound, while God transcends being compound and the attribution of compounds to Him. So believe in God and His messengers, and do not say, that the gods are, \u0060Three\u0027, God, Jesus and his mother. Refrain, from this and say what, it is better for you, [to say], which is the profession of His Oneness. Verily, God is but One God. Glory be to Him, transcending [the possibility], that He should have a son! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants, and such sovereignty is not compatible with [that] prophethood [of Jesus]. God suffices as a Guardian, a Witness to this.",
  "The Messiah, whom you claim is a god, would never disdain, [would never] scorn or reject haughtily, to be a servant of God, neither would the angels who are nigh, to God, disdain to be servants: this is a splendid digression [to the matter of the angels], and it is mentioned as a refutation of those who claim that they [the angels] are gods or the daughters of God, just as He refuted, with what was stated before, the Christians who claim that which is the subject of the address to them [above].

If there be two sisters, or more -- for this was revealed regarding Jbir [b. \u0060Abd Allh], who died and was survived by sisters --, theirs are two-thirds of what he, the brother, leaves; if there be, among the inheritors, siblings, men and women, then the male, among them, shall receive the equivalent of the portion of two females. God makes clear to you, the stipulations of your religion, lest you go astray; and God has knowledge of all things\u0027, including [matters of] inheritance: it is reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim] that al-Bar\u0027 [b. \u0060zib] said that this was the last of the \u0060duty\u0027 verses to be revealed.

  "O you who believe, do not profane God\u0027s sacraments (sha\u0060\u0027ir is the plural of sha\u0060ra), that is, the [ritual] ceremonies of the religion, by hunting [game] while you are on pilgrimage, nor the sacred month, by fighting in it, nor the offering, that is, the boon offered in the [Meccan] Sanctuary, by interfering with it, nor the garlands (qal\u0027id, is the plural of qilda, and these, made from the trees around the Sanctuary, were placed around it [the offering] to protect it), in other words, do not interfere with these [offerings] or with those who place them; nor, violate the sanctity of, those repairing, those heading, to the Sacred House, by fighting them [who are], seeking bounty, provision, from their Lord, through commerce, and, His, beatitude, by resorting to Him, as they [the Meccans pagans] falsely claimed (this was abrogated by the bar\u0027a verse [of srat al-Tawba, Q. 9:4]). But when you are discharged, from pilgrimage inviolability, then hunt for game (a command denoting permission). And let not hatred (read shana\u0027nu or shan\u0027nu) of a people that, because [they], barred you from the Sacred Mosque cause you to commit aggression, against them by killing them or otherwise. Help one another to righteousness, by doing that to which you were enjoined, and piety, by refraining from what you have been forbidden; do not help one another (ta\u0060wan: one of the two original t\u0027 letters [in tata\u0060wan] has been omitted) to sin, acts of disobedience, and enmity, transgression of God\u0027s bounds. And fear God, fear His punishment by being obedient to Him; surely God is severe in retribution, against those that oppose Him.",
  "Forbidden to you is carrion, that is, the consumption of it, and blood, that is, what has been spilt, as mentioned in [srat] al-An\u0060m [Q. 6:145], and the flesh of swine, and what has been hallowed to other than God, in that it was sacrificed in the name of something other than Him, and the beast strangled, to death, and the beast beaten down, to death, and the beast fallen, from a height to its death, and the beast gored, to death by another, and what beasts of prey have devoured, of such animals -- except for what you have sacrificed duly, catching it while it still breathes life and then sacrificing it -- and what has been sacrificed in, the name of, idols (nusub is the plural of nusb) and that you apportion, that is, that you demand an oath or a ruling, through the divining of arrows (azlm: the plural of zalam or zulam, which is a qidh, \u0060a small arrow\u0027, without feathers or a head). There were seven of these [arrows], [marked] with flags, and they were retained by the keeper of the Ka\u0060ba. They would use them for abitrations and when they commanded them they obeyed, and if they prohibited them they would desist; that is wickedness, a rebellion against obedience. And on the Day of \u0060Arafa in the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage, the following was revealed: Today the disbelievers have despaired of your religion, of you apostatising from it, having hoped for it [earlier], for now they perceived its strength; therefore do not fear them, but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you, that is, its rulings and obligations (after this [verse] nothing about [what is] lawful or unlawful was revealed) and I have completed My favour upon you, by perfecting it [your religion], but it is also said by [effecting] their safe entry into Mecca; and I have approved, chosen, Islam for you as religion. But whoever is constrained by emptiness, by hunger, to consume some of what has been forbidden him and consumes it, not inclining purposely to sin, to an act of disobedience -- then God is Forgiving, to him for what he has consumed, Merciful, to him by permitting it to him, in contrast to the one who [purposely] inclines to sin, that is, the one actively engaged in it, such as a waylayer or a criminal, for whom [such] consumption is forbidden.",
  "They will ask you, O Muhammad (s), about what, food, is made lawful for them. Say: \u0060The good, delicious, things are made lawful for you; and the, quarry of, hunting creatures, dogs, wildcats or birds that catch food, you have taught, training [them] as hounds (mukallibn is a circumstantial qualifier, derived from kallabtu al-kalba, meaning, \u0060I released the hound against the quarry\u0027) teaching them (tu\u0060allimnahunna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of mukallibn, \u0060training [them] as hounds\u0027, in other words, \u0060disciplining them\u0027) of what God has taught you, of the art of hunting; so eat what they have caught for you, even if they have killed it, as long as they have not eaten any of it. This is in contrast to the untrained [hunting creatures], whose catch is not lawful [for consumption]: the mark of these [being trained hunting creatures] is that they should return after they have been sent out, that they can be curbed when cried at and that they can seize the quarry without eating of it; the minimum number of times by which this may be known is three. If they eat any of it, then it cannot be counted as \u0060what they have caught\u0027 for their trainers, and is consequently unlawful for consumption, as reported in hadth in both of the Sahhs [of Bukhr and Muslim] -- therein it is also mentioned that a catch made by an arrow over which God\u0027s name is mentioned is equivalent [in lawfulness] to the catch of trained hunting creatures. And mention God\u0027s name over it, when you unleash it. And fear God. Indeed, God is swift at the reckoning\u0027.",
  "Today the good, the delicious, things are permitted to you, and the food of those who were given the Scripture, that is, animals slaughtered by the Jews and Christians, is permitted to you, and permitted to them is your food. Likewise, the believing, free, married women, and the married women of those who were given the Scripture before you, are permitted to you for marriage, if you give them their wages, their dowries, in wedlock, in marriage, and not illicitly, fornicating overtly with them, or taking them as lovers, so as to fornicate with them secretly. Whoever disbelieves in faith, that is, [whose] apostatises, his, prior good, work has indeed failed, and so it counts for nothing and he will not be rewarded for it, and in the Hereafter he shall be among the losers, if he dies in this state [of unbelief]. 2848851345",
  "O you who believe, when you stand up, that is, when you intend to go, to pray, and you are in [a state of] ritual impurity, wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows, that is, including them [the elbows], as is clarified in the Sunna; and wipe your heads (the b\u0027 in bi-ru\u0027sikum is for \u0060adherence\u0027), that is to say, wipe over [the head] adhering [the hand] closely, without [excessive] water pouring over; the noun [ra\u0027s, \u0060head\u0027] is generic, and so the minimum required to fulfil [the stipulation] is acceptable, which is the wiping of some of the hair, as al-Shfi\u0060 asserts); and your feet (read wa-arjulakum in the accusative as a supplement to aydyakum; or wa-arjulikum in the genitive because of its adjacency to [the genitive] bi-ru\u0027sikum), up to the ankles, that is, including them [the ankles], as is clarified in the Sunna, and they are the two protruding bones at the juncture of the legs and the feet. The interposing of the wiping of the head between [the mention of] the hands and the feet, which are washed, is intended to show the requirement of [a specific] order during the purification of these limbs, as al-Shfi\u0060 asserts. In addition, the requirement of making intention (niyya) in this [ablution], as in the other rituals of worship, is taken from the Sunna. If you are defiled, purify, wash, yourselves; but if you are sick, with an illness made worse by water, or on a journey, travelling, or if any of you comes from the privy, that is, [if] he has defecated, or you have touched women (as mentioned already in the verse in [srat] al-Nis\u0027 [Q. 4:43]), and you cannot find water, having made the effort to look for it, then head for, seek, wholesome dust, that is, clean earth, and wipe your faces and your hands, including the elbows, with it, using two strikes (the b\u0027 of bi-wujhikum, \u0060your faces\u0027, denotes \u0060adherence\u0027; it is explained in the Sunna that the requirement here is for the wiping to encompass the whole of these two parts. God does not desire to make any hardship for you, any constraint, in the obligations He has imposed on you with regard to ablution, washing and purification with dust; but He desires to purify you, of filth and sins, and that He may perfect His grace upon you, through Islam, by explaining the laws of the religion; so that you might give thanks, for His graces.",
  "And remember God\u0027s grace upon you, through Islam, and His covenant, His pledge, which He made, He bound, with you when you said, to the Prophet (s) upon pledging allegiance to him: \u0060We hear and we obey\u0027, all that you command and forbid, of what we love and what we despise. And fear God, in His covenant, lest you break it.

  "O you who believe, be upright before God, in [fulfilling] what is His due, witnesses in equity, in justice. Let not hatred of a people, namely, the disbelievers, cause you not to be just, and to harm them on account of their enmity; be just, towards both friend and foe, that, justice, is nearer to God-fearing. And fear God; surely God is aware of what you do, and will requite you for it.",
  "God has promised those who believe and perform righteous deeds, an excellent promise: they shall have forgiveness and a great wage, that is, Paradise.",
  "And they who disbelieve and deny Our signs -- they shall be the inhabitants of Hell-fire.",
  "O you who believe, remember God\u0027s favour upon you, when a people, namely, Quraysh, purposed to extend their hands against you, in order to attack you, but He restrained their hands from you, and protected you from what they intended to do to you; and fear God; and in God let the believers put their trust.",
  "God had made a covenant with the Children of Israel, for what will be mentioned shortly, and We raised up (there is a shift of address away from the third [to the first] person) from among them twelve leaders, from each tribe one leader, to be responsible for his people\u0027s fulfilment of the covenant, as a way of binding them [to it]. And God said, to them: \u0060I am with you, helping and assisting. Surely if (la-in, the lm is for oaths) you establish the prayer, and pay the alms, and believe in My messengers and succour them, help them, and lend to God a goodly loan, by expending in His way, I will absolve you of your evil deeds, and I will admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow. So whoever of you disbelieves after that, covenant, surely he has strayed from the right way\u0027, he has erred from the path to Paradise (al-saw\u0027 originally means \u0060the middle way\u0027). And they broke the covenant.",
  "God says: So because (bi-m, the m is extra) of their breaking their covenant, We cursed them, We removed them from Our mercy, and made their hearts hard, unyielding to the acceptance of faith; they pervert words, pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s) in the Torah and other things, from their contexts, those in which God has placed them, in other words, they substitute them; and they have forgotten, they have abandoned, a portion, a part, of what they were reminded of, [of what] they were enjoined to in the Torah, in the way of following Muhammad (s); and you -- addressing the Prophet (s) now -- will never cease to discover some treachery on their part, in the way of breaking a covenant or some other matter, except for a few of them, who have submitted themselves [to Islam]. Yet pardon them, and forgive; surely God loves the virtuous: this was abrogated by the \u0060sword\u0027 verse [Q. 9:5].",
  "And with those who say \u0060We are Christians\u0027 (this is semantically connected to [what follows]) We made a covenant, just as We did with the Children of Israel, the Jews, and they have forgotten a portion of that they were reminded of, in the Gospel, pertaining to faith and other matters, and they [too] broke the covenant. So We have stirred up, We have caused, among them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection, on account of their schisms and differing whims, each sect charging the other with unbelief; and God will assuredly tell them, in the Hereafter, of what they wrought, and requite them for this.",
  "O People of the Scripture, Jews and Christians, now there has come to you Our Messenger, Muhammad (s), making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the Scripture, the Torah and the Gospel, such as the \u0060stoning\u0027 verse and the description [of the Prophet Muhammad (s)], and pardoning much, of it, which he does not reveal, since this would not be of any benefit, serving only to disgrace you. There has verily come to you from God a light, namely, the Prophet (s), and a Book, a Qur\u0027n, lucid, plain and manifest,",
  "whereby, that is, the Book by which, God guides whoever follows His good pleasure, by believing, to the ways of peace, the paths of safety, and brings them forth from the shadows, [from] unbelief, into the light, [into] belief, by His leave, by His will, and He guides them to a straight path, the religion of Islam.",
  "They indeed are disbelievers those who say, \u0060God is the Messiah, son of Mary\u0027, insofar as they make him [Jesus] a god, and these were the Jacobites, a Christian sect. Say: \u0060Who then can do anything, [who then can] defend, against, the chastisement of, God if He desires to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother, and all those who are on earth?\u0027, that is to say, none can do anything of the sort, since if Jesus were a god, he would be able to do so. And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them. He creates what He will. God has power over everything, which He wills.",
  "The Jews and Christians, both of them, say: \u0060We are the sons of God, that is, [we are] like his sons in terms of closeness and rank, and He is like a father to us in terms of compassion and care, and His beloved ones\u0027. Say, to them, O Muhammad (s): \u0060Why then does He chastise you for your sins?, if what you say is true. For, the father does not punish his son, nor the loving his beloved; but He has punished you, and therefore you are saying lies. Nay; you are mortals from among, all, those, mortals, He created, you shall be rewarded as they are rewarded and you shall be requited as they are requited. He forgives, him for, whom He wills, forgiveness, and He chastises, him for, whom He wills\u0027, chastisement, and there can be no objection thereto. For to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth, and all that is between them; to Him is the journey\u0027s end, the [final] return.",
  "O People of the Scripture, there has verily come to you Our Messenger, Muhammad (s), making clear to you, the laws of religion, after an interval between the messengers, for there was no messenger between him and Jesus, an interval of 569 years; lest you should say, if you are punished: \u0060There has not come to us any bearer of good tidings (min bashr, the min is extra) nor any warner\u0027. Indeed, there has come to you a bearer of good tidings and a warner, and so you shall have no excuse. God has power over all things, including punishing you for not following him [the Messenger].",
  "And, mention, when Moses said to his people, \u0060O my people, remember God\u0027s favour to you, when He established among you, that is, from among you, prophets, and established you as kings, possessing servants and retinues, and gave you such as He had not given to any in all the worlds, in the way of manna and quails, the parting of the sea and other things.",
  "O my people, enter the Holy, the purified, Land which God has ordained for you, [which] He commanded you to enter, and this is Syria (al-shm), and do not turn back in flight, [do not] retreat in fear of the enemy, or you will end up as losers\u0027, in your efforts.",
  "They said, \u0060O Moses, there are giants in it, those remaining of the people of \u0060d, who were very tall and mighty; we will never enter it until they depart from it; if they depart from it then we will enter\u0027, it.",
  "There said, to them, two men of those who feared, contravening God\u0027s command, and these were Joshua and Caleb -- who were from among the leaders that Moses dispatched to bring back news of those giants -- to whom God had been gracious, by making them virtuous, for they concealed what they had discovered about the giants, telling only Moses, unlike the other leaders, who divulged the news, and so the people became cowardly. \u0060Enter against them by the gate!, the gate of the town, and have no fear of them, for they are bodies without hearts. For if you enter by it, you will be victorious: the two [Joshua and Caleb] said this because they were certain of God\u0027s assistance and the fulfilment of His promise. Put your trust in God, if you are believers\u0027.",
  "They said, \u0060O Moses, we will never enter it so long as they are in it. So go forth, you and your Lord, and fight, them, we will be sitting here\u0027, away from the fighting.",
  "He, Moses, thereupon, said, \u0060My Lord, I control none but myself and my brother, and I control no one else to be able to force them to obedience. So separate, distinguish, us from the wicked folk\u0027.",
  "He, God, exalted be He, said, to him: \u0060Then it, the Holy Land, shall be forbidden them, to enter, for forty years; they shall wander lost, bewildered, in the land -- according to Ibn \u0060Abbs this [land] was about nine parasangs [sc. 30 miles]; so do not grieve for the wicked folk\u0027. It is reported that they would travel throughout the night earnestly, but in the morning would find themselves back where they had started. And they would travel all day, with the same result, until they all perished, except those under twenty years of age. It is said that they numbered 600,000. Moses and Aaron died in the wilderness, and this was a mercy for them, and a chastisement for those others. When Moses was on the verge of death, he asked his Lord to bring him close to the Holy Land, to within a stone\u0027s throw, and He did, as related in hadth. Joshua became a prophet sometime after his fortieth year and he was commanded to fight against the giants. So he sallied forth with those that remained by his side and he fought against them; it was a Friday and the sun stopped for him for an hour, until he had finished with fighting them. Ahmad [b. Hanbal] reported in his Musnad the [following] hadth, \u0060The sun was never detained for any human, except for Joshua during those days in which he marched towards the Holy House [of Jerusalem]\u0027.",
  "And recite, O Muhammad (s), to them, your people, the story, the tale, of the two sons of Adam, Abel and Cain, truthfully (bi\u0027l-haqq is semantically connected to utlu, \u0060recite\u0027), how they each offered a sacrifice, to God, which in Abel\u0027s case was a ram, and in Cain\u0027s, some green crops, and it was accepted from one of them, namely, from Abel, when a fire came down from the heaven and consumed his offering, and not accepted from the other, that is, from Cain, and so he became furious and kept secret his envy until Adam left on pilgrimage. He said, to him, \u0060I will surely slay you,\u0027, and the other said, \u0060Why?\u0027, to which the first replied, \u0060Because only your offering was accepted\u0027. The other said, \u0060God accepts only from the God-fearing\u0027.",
  "\u0060Yet if (la-in, the lm is for oaths) you extend your hand against me to slay me, I will not extend my hand against you to slay you; I fear God, the Lord of the Worlds, in slaying you.",
  "I desire that you should end up with my sin, the sin of slaying me, and your own sin, the one that you had committed before, and so become an inhabitant of the Fire, whereas I do not want to end up with your sin if I were to slay you, and become one of them. God, exalted be He, says: that is the requital of the evildoers\u0027.",
  "Then his soul prompted him, it seduced him, to slay his brother, so he slew him and became one of the losers, by slaying him. And he did not know what to do with him, because he was the first of the Children of Adam to die on earth, and so he carried him on his back.",
  "Then God sent forth a raven, scratching into the earth, digging up the soil with its beak and with its legs and throwing it up over a dead raven next to it until it completely hid it, to show him how he might hide the nakedness, the carcass, of his brother. He said, \u0060Woe to me! Am I not able to be as this raven, and so hide my brother\u0027s nakedness?\u0027 And he became one of the remorseful, for having carried him; he then dug [a hole] for him and covered him up.",
  "Because of that, which Cain did, We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever slays a soul for other than a soul, slain, or for, other than, corruption, committed, in the land, in the way of unbelief, fornication or waylaying and the like, it shall be as if he had slain mankind altogether; and whoever saves the life of one, by refraining from slaying, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind -- Ibn \u0060Abbs said [that the above is meant] in the sense of violating and protecting its [a soul\u0027s] sanctity [respectively]. Our messengers have already come to them, that is, to the Children of Israel, with clear proofs, miracles, but after that many of them still commit excesses in the land, overstepping the bounds through disbelief, killing and the like.",
  "The following was revealed when the \u0060Arniyyn came to Medina suffering from some illness, and the Prophet (s) gave them permission to go and drink from the camels\u0027 urine and milk. Once they felt well they slew the Prophet\u0027s shepherd and stole the herd of camels: Truly the only requital of those who fight against God and His Messenger, by fighting against Muslims, and hasten about the earth to do corruption there, by waylaying, is that they shall be slaughtered, or crucified, or have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, that is, their right hands and left feet, or be banished from the land (the aw, \u0060or\u0027, is [used] to indicate the [separate] application of [each of] the cases [listed]; thus, death is for those that have only killed; crucifixion is for those that have killed and stolen property; the cutting off [of limbs on opposite sides] is for those that have stolen property but have not killed; while banishment is for those that pose a threat -- this was stated by Ibn \u0060Abbs and is the opinion of al-Shfi\u0060; the more sound of his [al-Shfi\u0060\u0027s] two opinions is that crucifixion should be for three days after [the] death [of the killer], or, it is also said, shortly before [he is killed]; with banishment are included similar punishments, such as imprisonment and the like). That, mentioned requital, is a degradation, a humiliation, for them in this world; and in the Hereafter theirs will be a great chastisement, namely, the chastisement of the Fire.",
  "Except for such, warmongers and waylayers, as repent before you overpower them; for know that God is Forgiving, to them of what they have done, Merciful, to them. This [proviso] is expressed without any statement to the effect \u0060do not submit them to prescribed legal punishment\u0027, to point out that when such a person repents only God\u0027s prescribed punishments (hudd) -- and not those deriving from the rights of human beings -- are waived. This is how I see it. I do not know of any that have tackled this [topic], and God knows best. If, then, a person has killed and stolen property, he should be killed and have his limbs cut off [on opposite sides], but not crucified -- this is the more sound of two opinions held by al-Shfi\u0060. However, his repentance is of no avail, once he has been overpowered [by the authorities] -- this is also the more sound of two opinions held by him.",
  "O you who believe, fear God, fear His chastisement, by being obedient to Him, and seek the means to Him, that obedience which brings you closer to Him, and struggle in His way, in order to elevate His religion; so that you might prosper, triumph.",
  "Truly, as for the disbelievers, if they possessed, definitely, all that is in the earth, and the like of it with it, by which to ransom themselves from the chastisement of the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them; theirs shall be a painful chastisement.",

  "And the thieving male and the thieving female (the definite article in both [nouns] relates to the subject [sc. wa\u0027lladh saraqa wa\u0027llat saraqat, \u0060And the male who thieves and the female who thieves\u0027]; because this [clause] resembles a conditional statement [sc. \u0060if he thieves, if she thieves\u0027 etc.] the f\u0027 has been included in the predicate [fa\u0027qta\u0060, \u0060then cut off\u0027]) cut off their hands, that is, the right hand of each of the two from the wristbone; it is explained in the Sunna that the amputation applies to [the stealing of] a quarter of a dinar and upwards, and if the person were to re-offend, the left foot should then be amputated from the ankle, and then [on subsequent re-offending] the left hand [is amputated], followed by the right foot, after which discretionary punishment is applied; as a requital (jaz\u0027an is in the accusative because it is a verbal noun) for what they have earned, and an exemplary punishment, for both of them, from God; God is Mighty, His way will prevail, Wise, in His creation.",
  "But whoever repents after his evildoing, refrains from theft, and amends, his actions, God will relent to him. God is indeed Forgiving, Merciful, in expressing what has been stated. However, the rights of the victim to have the penalty of amputation carried out and his property restored are not [automatically] forgone after repentance. In fact, as is clarified in the Sunna, only if he is pardoned before being taken to the Imam is the [punishment of] amputation waived, and al-Shfi\u0060 is of this opinion.",

  "O Messenger, let them not grieve you, the actions of, those who vie with one another in disbelief, falling headlong into it, in other words, they [who] manifest it at every opportunity, of (min here is explicative) such as say with their mouths, with their tongues (bi-alsinatihim is semantically connected to ql, \u0060[such] as say\u0027), \u0060We believe\u0027 but their hearts do not believe, and these are the hypocrites; and from among those of Jewry, there is a folk, who listen to calumny, fabricated by their rabbis, listening acceptingly, listening to, you, on behalf of some, other folk, from among the Jews, who have not come to you: these were the inhabitants of Khaybar, among whom two married persons committed adultery, but whom they did not want to stone. And so they dispatched [men from] Qurayza to ask the Prophet (s) about the ruling concerning the two; perverting words, that are in the Torah, such as the \u0060stoning\u0027 verse, from their contexts, [the contexts] in which God had placed them, that is to say, substituting them, saying, to the ones they dispatched: \u0060If you are given this, distorted ruling, that is, flogging, which Muhammad (s) has pronounced for you as a ruling, then take it, accept it; but if you are not given it, and he pronounces some other ruling for you, then beware!\u0027, of accepting it! Whomever God desires to try, to lead astray, you cannot avail him anything against God, by preventing such [a trial]. Those are they whose hearts God did not desire to purify, of unbelief, for had He desired it, you would have [been able to do something for them]; theirs shall be degradation in this world, humiliation, by being disgraced and subjected to the jizya, and in the Hereafter theirs shall be a great chastisement.",
  "They are, listeners to calumny and consumers of unlawful gain (read suhut or suht), that which is illicit, such as bribes. If they come to you, to judge between them, then judge between them or turn away from them: the [second] option given here was abrogated by His saying, So judge between them [to the end of] the verse [Q. 5:48]. Therefore, we [Muslims] are obliged to judge between them if they request arbitration before us -- and this is the more sound of al-Shfi\u0060\u0027s two opinions. If their request for arbitration involves a Muslim, however, then we are obliged to judge according to the consensus [of legal scholars and not just al- Shfi\u0060]); if you turn away from them, they cannot harm you at all; and if you judge, between them, then judge justly between them; God loves the just, those that judge fairly, meaning that He will reward them.",
  "But how is it that they make you their judge when they have the Torah, wherein is God\u0027s judgement, of stoning: the interrogative here is for [provoking] amazement, in other words, they were not seeking thereby [by making you their judge] to discover the truth but a lighter punishment for them; and then they turn away, [and then] they reject your ruling of stoning, which accords with what is in their Scripture, after that, request [to you] for arbitration? Such are not believers.",
  "Surely We revealed the Torah, wherein is guidance, from error, and light, that is, an exposition of the rulings, by which the prophets, from the Children of Israel, who had submitted, [who] had been compliant before God, judged for those of Jewry, as did the rabbis, the scholars among them, and the priests, the jurists, according to, because of, that which they were bidden to observe, [that which] was entrusted to them, that is to say, [that which] God bid them to observe, of God\u0027s Scripture, lest they change it, and were witnesses to, its truth. So do not fear men, O Jews, in disclosing what you have pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s), the \u0060stoning\u0027 verse and otherwise; but fear Me, when you conceal it; and do not sell, do not exchange, My signs for a small price, of this world, which you take in return for concealing them. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed -- such are the disbelievers, in it.",
  "And therein, in the Torah, We prescribed, We made obligatory, for them that a life, be slain in return, for a life, if it has slain one; and an eye, should be gouged out, for an eye, and a nose, is to be cut off, for a nose, and an ear, is to be amputated, for an ear, and a tooth, should be pulled out, for a tooth (a variant reading has the last four [nouns] in the nominative); and for wounds (read wa\u0027l-jurhu or wa\u0027l-jurha) retaliation, that is, the person is entitled to retaliate if this is feasible, as in the case of a hand or a leg; but in cases where one is not able to [retaliate], this is left to arbitration. Although this stipulation was prescribed for them, it is established in our Law; but whoever forgoes it, that is, retaliation, out of charity, able to restrain himself, then that shall be an expiation for him, of what he has done [of other sins]. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed, in the matter of retaliation and otherwise, those are the evildoers.",

So judge between them, between the People of the Scripture, if they take their cases before you, according to what God has revealed, to you, and do not follow their whims, deviating, away from the truth that has come to you. To every one of you, O communities, We have appointed a divine law and a way, a clear path in religion, for them to proceed along. If God had willed, He would have made you one community, following one Law, but, He separated you one from the other, that He may try you in what He has given to you, of the differing Laws, in order to see who among you is obedient and who is disobedient. So vie with one another in good works, strive hastily thereunto; to God you shall all return, through resurrection, and He will then inform you of that in which you differed, in the matter of religion, and requite each of you according to his deeds.",
  "And judge between them according to what God has revealed, and do not follow their whims, and beware of them lest they seduce you, [lest] they lead you astray, from part of what God has revealed to you.

God, exalted be He, says: But it may be that God will bring victory, by assisting His Prophet and making His religion prevail; or some commandment from Him, that will reveal the secrets of the hypocrites, disgracing them; and then they will end up, for what they kept secret within themselves, in the way of doubt and affiliating with disbelievers, remorseful.",

God, exalted be He, says: Fettered be, withheld be, their hands, from the performance of good deeds, as an invocation against them; and they are cursed for what they have said. Nay, but His hands are extended out wide -- a hyperbole for the attribute of generosity -- the use of [yad] the dual for yad, \u0060hand\u0027, is intended to imply abundance, since the utmost that an affluent person can give freely of his wealth is when he gives it with both hands. He expends how He will, in giving abundantly or straitening, and there can be no objection to this. And what has been revealed to you from your Lord, of the Qur\u0027n, will surely increase many of them in insolence and disbelief, because of their [very] disbelief in it; and We have cast between them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection, and so every sect among them is opposed to the other. Every time they light the fires of war, that is, for war against the Prophet (s), God extinguishes them, that is, every time they desire it [war], He repels them.

God will protect you from people, who may try to kill you. The Prophet (s) used to have guards up until [the time that] this [verse] was revealed, then he said, \u0060Depart, for God protects me now\u0027, as reported by al-Hkim.

  "Say: \u0060O People of the Scripture, you have no basis, in religion, on which to rely, until you observe the Torah and the Gospel and what was revealed to you from your Lord\u0027, by implementing what is therein, including believing in me [Muhammad (s)]. And what has been revealed to you from your Lord, of the Qur\u0027n, will surely increase many of them in insolence and disbelief, because of their disbelief in it; so do not grieve for the disbelieving folk, if they do not believe in you, in other words, do not be concerned with them.",
  "Surely those who believe and those of Jewry ([this constitutes] the subject of the clause), namely, the Jews, and the Sabaeans, a sect among them, and the Christians (and [what follows] substitutes for the [above] subject): whoever, of them, believes in God and the Last Day and behaves righteously -- no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve, in the Hereafter (this [fa-l khawfun \u0060alayhim wa-l hum yahzann, \u0060no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve\u0027] is the predicate of the subject and also indicates the predicate of [the clause beginning with] inna, \u0060surely\u0027).",
  "And We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, to believe in God and His messengers, and We sent messengers to them. Every time a messenger came to them, from among them, with what their souls did not desire, in the way of truth, they denied it; some, of them, they denied, and some, of them, they slay, such as Zachariah and John (the use of [the present tense] yaqtuln, \u0060they slay\u0027, instead of [the perfect tense] qatal is to narrate past events [as if in the present] and to conclude [in harmony with] the end- rhyme of the verses).",
  "And they thought, they presumed that, there would be no (read as an l taknu, where an has been softened; or read an l takna, where it [an] requires a [following] subjunctive, that is to say, \u0060that there would [not] befall [them]\u0027) trial, a punishment against them, for their denial of the messengers and their slaying of them; and so they were wilfully blind, to the truth and could not see it, and deaf, [unable] to hear it. Then God relented to them, when they repented, then they were wilfully blind and deaf, a second time, many of them (kathrun minhum substitutes for the [third] person [\u0060they\u0027]); and God sees what they do, and will requite them for it.",
  "They indeed are disbelievers those who say, \u0060Indeed God is the Messiah, son of Mary\u0027 (a similar verse has preceded [Q. 5:17]). For the Messiah said, to them, \u0060O Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord, for, I am a servant and not a god. Verily he who associates anything with God, in worship, for him God has made Paradise forbidden, He has forbidden him admittance to it, and his abode shall be the Fire; and for wrongdoers (wa-m li\u0027l-zlimna min, the min is extra) there shall be no helpers\u0027, to guard them against the chastisement of God.",
  "They are indeed disbelievers those who say, \u0060God is the third of three\u0027, gods, that is, He is one of them, the other two being Jesus and his mother, and they [who claim this] are a Christian sect; when there is no god but the One God. If they do not desist from what they say, when they declare a trinity, and profess His Oneness, those of them who disbelieve, that is, [those] who are fixed upon unbelief, shall suffer a painful chastisement, namely, the Fire.",
  "Will they not turn in repentance to God and seek His forgiveness?, for what they say (the interrogative is intended as a rebuke); God is Forgiving, to the one who repents, Merciful, to him.",
  "The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a messenger; messengers passed away before him, and so he passed away like them, for he is not a god as they claim, otherwise he would not have passed away; his mother was a truthful woman, [siddqa means] extremely truthful; they both used to eat food, like all other human beings, and one who is such cannot be a god because of his compound being and fallible nature, and because of the [impurities such as] urine and excrement that he produces. Behold, in amazement, how We make the signs, of Our Oneness, clear to them, then behold, how they are turned away!, [how] they are turned away from the truth despite the proof being established.",
  "Say: \u0060Do you worship besides God, that is, other than Him, what cannot hurt or profit you? God is the Hearer, of your sayings, the Knower\u0027, of your circumstances (the interrogative is meant as a disavowal).",
  "Say: \u0060O People of the Scripture, Jews and Christians, do not go to extremes, do [not] overstep the bounds, in your religion, other than those, extremes, of truth, neither lowering nor elevating Jesus above his proper place, and do not follow the whims of a people who went astray formerly, on account of their extremism -- these were their forefathers -- and have led many, [other] people, astray, and strayed from the even way\u0027, from the path of truth (al-saw\u0027 originally means \u0060middle\u0027).",
  "Cursed were the disbelievers of the Children of Israel by the tongue of David, when he invoked God against them and they were transformed into apes -- these were the people of Eilat -- and by Jesus, son of Mary, when he invoked God against them and they were transformed into pigs -- they were the ones [who ate] at the Table [cf. Q. 5:115, below] -- that, cursing, was because of their disobedience and their transgression.",

  "Yet had they believed in God and the Prophet, Muhammad (s), and what has been revealed to him, they would not have affiliated with them, namely, [with] the disbelievers; but many of them are wicked, rebellious against faith.",
  "You, O Muhammad (s), will truly find the most hostile of people to those who believe to be the Jews and the idolaters, of Mecca, because of the intensity of their disbelief, ignorance and utter preoccupation with following whims; and you will truly find the nearest of them in love to those who believe to be those who say \u0060Verily, we are Christians\u0027; that, nearness of theirs in love to the believers is, because some of them are priests, scholars, and monks, devout worshippers, and because they are not disdainful, of following the truth, as the Jews and the Meccans are.",
  "This [verse] was revealed when the Negus\u0027s delegation from Abyssinia came to him (s): when the Prophet (s) recited srat Y Sn, they cried and submitted [to Islam], saying, \u0060How similar this is to what used to be revealed to Jesus!\u0027 God, exalted be He, says: And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, of the Qur\u0027n, you see their eyes overflow with tears because of what they recognise of the truth. They say, \u0060Our Lord, we believe, we accept the truth of your Prophet and your Book, so inscribe us among the witnesses, those who affirm their acceptance of the truth.",
  "And, in response to those Jews who reviled them for their Islam, they would say: why should we not believe in God and what has come to us of the truth, the Qur\u0027n, that is to say, there is nothing to prevent us from faith when its prerequisites are present; and hope (natma\u0060u is a supplement to nu\u0027minu, \u0060we believe\u0027) that our Lord should admit us with the righteous people?\u0027, the believers, into Paradise?",

  "When a number of Companions resolved to practise fasting and night vigil continuously, and to abstain from women, perfume, consumption of meat, and sleeping on beds, the following was revealed: O you who believe, do not forbid the good things that God has made lawful for you and do not transgress, do [not] exceed God\u0027s command; God does not love transgressors.",

  "God will not take you to task for a slip, contained, in your oaths, which is what the tongue utters spontaneously, without intending to swear an oath, such as when one says, \u0060No, by God\u0027, or \u0060Yes, by God\u0027; but He will take you to task for that to which you have pledged (read \u0060aqadtum, \u0060aqqadttum or \u0060qadttum) oaths, where you have sworn an oath intentionally; the expiation thereof, of the oath if you break it, is the feeding of ten of the needy, for each needy person one mudd measure, of the midmost food, from which, you feed your families, that is, the closest or the principal [food you consume], neither better, nor worse; or the clothing of them, with what may be [properly] called clothes, such as a shirt, a turban, or a loin cloth -- it is not sufficient that these [items] mentioned be given only to one needy person, according to al-Shfi\u0060; or the setting free of a, believing, slave, as applies in the expiation for slaying or repudiation through zihr, interpreting the general [stipulation] in a restricted sense; and whoever does not find the means, for any one of the [expiations] mentioned, then the fasting of three days, as an expiation for him -- as it appears [in this verse], it is not obligatory to follow the [above] sequence [of alternatives when making an expiation], and this is the opinion of al-Shfi\u0060. That, which is mentioned, is the expiation of your oaths if you have sworn, and have broken them; but keep your oaths, do not break them, unless it be for a righteous deed or setting right between people, as stated in the verse of srat al-Baqara [Q. 2:225]. So, in the same way that He has explained to you what has been mentioned, God makes clear to you His signs, so that you might be thankful, to Him for this.",

  "Satan desires only to precipitate enmity and hatred between you through wine and games of chance, when you partake of them, because of the evil and discord that result therefrom; and to bar you, by your being preoccupied with them, from the remembrance of God and from prayer -- He has specifically mentioned it [prayer] so as to magnify it. So will you then desist?, from partaking of them? In other words: Desist!",

  "O you who believe, God will surely try you, He will surely test you, with some game, which He releases to you, the smaller of, which will be caught by your hands and, the larger of which by, your lances: this was in [the plain of] al-Hudaybiyya; while they were in [the state of] pilgrimage inviolability, beasts and birds would flock to their caravans; so that God may know, through knowledge outwardly manifested, who fears Him in the Unseen (bi\u0027l-ghayb is a circumstantial qualifier), in other words, while He is absent [to the eyes], one who does not see Him but nonetheless avoids hunting game. Whoever transgresses thereafter, after that prohibition against it, and hunts, his shall be a painful chastisement.",
  "O you who believe, do not slay game while you are in the state of pilgrimage inviolability, for the hajj or the \u0060umra; whoever of you slays it wilfully, then the compensation shall be (read fa-jaz\u0027un, \u0060then the compensation [shall be]\u0027, followed by a nominative [mithlu, \u0060the like of\u0027]) that is to say, a compensation is incumbent on him, and that is, the equivalent of what he has slain, of flocks, in other words, a similar creature (a variant reading has an annexation construction for jaz\u0027, \u0060compensation\u0027, [sc. fa-jaz\u0027u mithli, \u0060then the compensation of\u0027]), to be judged, that is, the equivalent [is to be judged], by two just men among you, both possessing astuteness, with which they are able to identify the nearest [animal] in equivalence to it [the slain animal]. Ibn \u0060Abbs, \u0060Umar and \u0060Al, may God be pleased with them, all adjudged a beast of sacrifice [as redemption] for an ostrich [slain]; Ibn \u0060Abbs and Ab \u0060Ubayda adjudged a cow [as redemption] for wildebeest or wild ass; [\u0060Abd Allh] Ibn \u0060Umar and [\u0060Abd al-Rahmn] Ibn \u0060Awf, a sheep for a gazelle, and, as Ibn \u0060Abbs, \u0060Umar and others did, [a sheep] also [as a redemption] for [slaying] pigeons, because they [pigeons] resemble these [sheep] in taking scoops of water [when drinking]; an offering (hadyan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to jaz\u0027, \u0060compensation\u0027) to reach the Ka\u0060ba, that is, to be taken into the Sanctuary, sacrificed there and given as a voluntary offering to its needy [residents], and it cannot be sacrificed wherever [else] it may be (bligha l-ka\u0060ba, \u0060to reach the Ka\u0060ba\u0027, is in the accusative because it is an adjectival qualification of what precedes, even if it stands as an annexation, since such an annexation is only morphological and not [valid] as a [grammatical] characterisation); if there is no equivalent beast of flock for the game slain, as in the case of a small bird or locusts, then the person is obliged [to compensate] with [equivalent] value. Or, it is incumbent on him [to make], an expiation: other than compensation, and if he should find the means then this [expiation] is, food for the poor, [food] to be taken from the principal food of the town, equivalent to the value of the compensation, being one mudd measure for each poor person (a variant reading has kaffra, \u0060expiation\u0027, in an annexation with the following noun [sc. kaffratu ta\u0060min, \u0060the expiation of food\u0027] as an explication [of kaffra, \u0060expiation\u0027]); or, it is incumbent on him [to compensate with], the equivalent of that, food, in fasting, so that he fasts one day for every mudd measure [that he is unable to provide]; but if he has the means to [provide the food] then it is incumbent on him to do so, so that he may taste the evil consequence, the burden of the compensation, of his deed, the one he has perpetrated. God has pardoned what is past, of game slain before it was prohibited; but whoever offends again, God will take vengeance on him; God is Mighty, His way will prevail, Lord of Retribution, against those who disobey Him. Unintentional slaying [of game] is also included with intentional slaying in what has been mentioned [of required compensation or expiation].",

  "God has appointed the Ka\u0060ba, the Sacred, inviolable, House as an [enduring] institution for mankind, [an institution] by which their religious affair is sustained, through pilgrimage to it, as is their this-worldly [affair], on account of the security [guaranteed] for those who enter it and the fact that they are not interfered with, and because all manner of fruits are brought to it (a variant reading [for qiyman] has qiyaman, \u0060[always] standing\u0027, as the verbal noun from [1st form] qma, \u0060to remain standing\u0027, without defectiveness [of the middle radical]); and the sacred month, meaning the sacred months of Dh\u0027l-Qa\u0060da, Dh\u0027l-Hijja, Muharram and Rajab, instituted for them to be secure from fighting during them; the offering and the garlands, instituted for their owner so that he does not suffer any interference; that, mentioned appointment, is so that you may know that God knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth, and that God has knowledge of all things: thus that appointing of His in order to secure benefits for you and to ward off harm from you, before such things came to pass, testifies to His knowledge of all that is in existence and all that will be.",

So do not ask about them; indeed: God has pardoned those things, you asked about, so do not ask again; for God is Forgiving, Forbearing.",
  "Verily a people before you asked about them, that is, [they asked] their prophets about such things and they received the response in the form of [revealed] explications of the rules concerning them; and then they disbelieved in them, by neglecting to implement them.",
  "God has not ordained, He has not stipulated [in His Law], anything such as a Bahra, a S\u0027iba, a Wasla or a Hm, in the way that people did at the time of paganism. Al-Bukhr reported [in a hadth] from Sa\u0060d b. al- Musayyab, who said: \u0060The bahra is that [camel] whose milk is consecrated to idols and whom no human may milk; the s\u0027iba is the one they would leave to roam freely for their gods and was forbidden to bear any load; the wasla is the young she-camel that would give birth to a young female, as its first offspring, followed by another female, bearing one after the other without a male in between: she would then be left to roam freely for their idols; the hm is the mature male camel, which after completing a certain number of copulations with a female, would then be consigned to their idols and be exempt from bearing any load, and they would call it hm; but the disbelievers invent lies against God, in this matter, by attributing [the sanctioning of] such [practices] to Him; and most of them do not understand, that this is mendacity, for in this they have [merely] followed the example of their forefathers.",
  "And when it is said to them, \u0060Come to what God has revealed and to the Messenger\u0027, that is, to His ruling concerning the permitting of what you have forbidden, they say, \u0060What we have found our fathers following suffices us\u0027, in the way of religion and laws. God, exalted be He, says: What, does that suffice them, even if their fathers knew nothing and were not guided?, to any truth (the interrogative is meant as a disavowal).",
  "O you who believe, you are responsible for your own souls, in other words, preserve them and do what is in their best interest; he who is astray cannot hurt you, if you are rightly guided: it is said that this means, \u0060None of those misguided ones from among the People of the Scripture can hurt you\u0027; it is also said to mean others, on the basis of the [following] hadth of Ab Tha\u0060laba al-Khushan: \u0060I asked the Messenger of God (s) about it [this verse] and he said, \u0022Enjoin one other to decency and forbid one another indecency, and then if you see niggardliness being obeyed, whims being followed, this present world being preferred, and every intelligent person proud of his own opinions, then you are [still] responsible for [looking after] your own soul\u0022,\u0027 as reported by al-Hkim and others. Unto God you shall return, all together, and He will inform you of what you used to do, and requite you for it.",
  "O you who believe, let testimony between you, when death, that is, [one of] its causes, draws near to one of you, at the time of a bequest, be that of two men of justice among you (ithnni dhaw \u0060adlin minkum, \u0060two men of justice among you\u0027, is the predicate expressed with the sense of an imperative, in other words, \u0060let [two men] bear witness ... [etc.]\u0027; the genitive annexation of shahda, \u0060testimony\u0027, and bayn, \u0060between\u0027, is meant to allow for a range [of alternatives]; hn, \u0060at the time of\u0027, is a substitute for idh, \u0060when\u0027, or an adverbial qualifier of time for [the verb] hadara, \u0060draws near\u0027); or of two others from another folk, that is, [from] other than your own religious community, if you are travelling in the land and the affliction of death befalls you. Then you shall empanel them, you shall detain them (tahbisnahum, \u0060you shall empanel them\u0027, is an adjectival qualification of kharn, \u0060two others\u0027) after the, mid-afternoon, prayer and, if you are in doubt, [if] you are uncertain about it [their testimony], they shall swear by God, both of them saying: \u0060We will not sell it, [our testimony] in [swearing by] God, for any price, [for] any compensation that we might take in exchange for it from this world, neither by swearing by Him [falsely], nor by testifying falsely for the sake of that [price]; even if he, the person before whom it is being sworn or the one for whose sake testimony is being given, be a near kinsman, a close relative of ours, nor will we hide testimony to God, which He has commanded us [to give], for then, if we were to hide it, we would surely be among the sinful\u0027.",
  "But if it be discovered, [if] it be ascertained after they have sworn their oaths, that both of them have merited [the suspicion of] sin, that is, that they have done something to incur it, in the way of a breach of faith or perjury in the testimony; for example, if what they are accused of is found with them and then they claim that they had bought it from the deceased or that he had bequeathed it to them, then two others shall take their place, so that the oaths are to be taken from them, being the nearest (al-awlayn is a substitution for kharn, \u0060two others\u0027; a variant reading has al-awwaln, plural of awwal, as an adjectival qualification of, or a substitution for, alladhna, \u0060of those\u0027), in kinship to the deceased, of those most concerned, with the bequest, namely, the inheritors, and they shall swear by God, to the breach of faith of the two witnesses, and they shall both say, \u0060Verily, our testimony, our oath, is truer, is more faithful, than their testimony, their oath, and we have not transgressed, we have [not] overstepped the [bounds of] truth in our oaths, for then we would assuredly be among the evildoers\u0027: meaning, let the one about to die call two men as witnesses to his bequest, or let him instruct in his bequest that the two be from among his co-religionists or from among others, if he cannot find any [from among the former] because he is travelling or for some similar reason. If the inheritors have doubts about the two men and claim a breach of faith on the part of the two for having taken something or given it to some other person -- alleging that the deceased bequeathed it to him -- then let the two men swear in full [in the way mentioned above]. If then some indication surfaces that the two men have been lying and these two then claim some motivation for this action [of theirs], the nearest of the inheritors in kinship [to the deceased] shall swear to the perjury of the two men and to the truth of what they [the inheritors] suspected. This stipulation holds for the two trustees, but is abrogated in the case of the two witnesses. Likewise, the testimony of non co-religionists is abrogated. The reason for [stipulating] the mid-afternoon prayer is to consecrate the oaths. The specification in this verse that the oath be from the two inheritors nearest in kinship concerns the incident regarding which it was revealed. This [incident], as reported by al-Bukhr, involved a man from the Ban Sahm who had set out on a journey with Tamm al- Dr and \u0060Adiyy b. Badd\u0027, when they were both [still] Christians. The man from the Ban Sahm died in a place where there were no Muslims. When the two came back with his bequest, they [his relatives] found that a silver bowl plated with gold was missing and so the two were brought before the Prophet (s); thereupon this verse was revealed. The Prophet (s) made the two swear oaths. The bowl was later discovered in Mecca, where the owners said that they had bought it from Tamm and \u0060Udayy. The next verse was then revealed, after which two of the Sahm man\u0027s close kin came to swear their oaths; in al-Tirmidh\u0027s version, \u0060Amr b. al-\u0060s, who was closer to the deceased man, stood up with one other from among the kin, and they swore an oath; in yet another version, the [Sahm] man fell ill and instructed them as to his bequest and asked them to deliver what he had left to his family, but when he died, they took the bowl [and sold it] and then gave what remained [of that money] to his family.",
  "That, ruling mentioned, where the oath devolves to the inheritors, [makes it] likelier, brings closer [the eventuality], that they, the witnesses or the trustees, will bear the testimony in its true form, [the form] in which they have been charged to bear it, without distortion or breach of faith, or, it is likelier, that they will be afraid that after their oaths other oaths may be taken, from the inheritors, the plaintiffs, who would swear to the two men\u0027s breach of faith or perjury, in which case they would be disgraced and would incur penalties, and so [because of this] they will not lie. Fear God, by refraining from betrayal and perjury, and listen, to what you have been commanded, listening in acceptance.

  "Mention, the day when God shall gather the messengers, which is the Day of Resurrection, and He will say, to them, as a rebuke for their peoples: \u0060What answer were you given?\u0027, when you summoned [them] to proclaim God\u0027s Oneness; they shall say, \u0060We have no knowledge, of this; You, only You, are the Knower of things unseen\u0027, those things which are hidden from [God\u0027s] servants and that which they [the messengers] have forgotten all knowledge of on account of the great terror of the Day of Resurrection and their fright; but when they have calmed down, they [proceed to] bear witness against their communities.",
  "Mention, when God said, \u0060O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favour to you and to your mother, be thankful for it; when I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit, Gabriel, to speak to people (tukallimu\u0027l-nsa is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the [suffixed pronoun] kf in ayyadtu-ka) in the cradle, that is, as a child, and in maturity -- this implies that he will descend before the Hour, since he was raised up [to God] before middle age, as has already been mentioned in [srat] l \u0060Imrn [Q. 3:55], and when I taught you the Scripture, and wisdom, and the Torah, and the Gospel; and how you create out of clay the likeness (ka- hay\u0027at: the kf here functions like a noun and is a direct object), the image, of a bird by My permission, and you breathe into it and it becomes a bird by My permission, by My will, and you heal the blind and the leper by My permission, and you raise the dead, from their graves back to life, by My permission; and how I restrained the Children of Israel from you, when they intended to kill you, when you brought them clear proofs, miracles, and the disbelievers among them said, \u0022This, what you have done, is nothing but manifest sorcery\u0022 (a variant reading [for sihrun, \u0060sorcery\u0027] has shirun, \u0060sorcerer\u0027, in other words, [he] Jesus [is nothing but a manifest sorcerer]).",
  "And when I revealed to the disciples, [when] I commanded them by the tongue of Jesus: \u0022Believe in Me and in My Messenger\u0022, Jesus; they said, \u0022We believe, in both; bear witness that we have submitted\u0022.\u0027",
  "Mention, when the disciples said, \u0060O Jesus, son of Mary, is your Lord able, that is, would He (a variant reading has hal tastat\u0060a rabbaka, \u0060Are you able to ask of Him?\u0027) to send down on us a Table from the heaven?\u0027 He, Jesus, said, to them: \u0060Fear God, when you request signs, if you are believers\u0027.",
  "They said, \u0060We desire, to request this in order, to eat of it and that our hearts be reassured, through increased certainty, and that we may know, that we may acquire more awareness [of the fact], that you (annaka is softened to an) have spoken truthfully to us, in your claim to prophethood, and that we may be among the witnesses thereof\u0027.",
  "Jesus, son of Mary, said: \u0060O God, our Lord, send down upon us a Table from the heaven, that it shall be, that is, the day of its sending down [shall be], a celebration for us, which we shall consecrate and honour, for the first (li-awwalin is an inclusive substitution for lan, \u0060for us\u0027, with the repetition of the [oblique] preposition [li-]) and the last of us, those who will come after us, and a sign from You, of Your power and my prophethood. And provide, it, for us; You are the Best of Providers\u0027.",
  "God said, granting his supplication: \u0060Verily I shall send it down (read munziluh or munazziluh) to you; but whoever of you disbelieves afterward, after it has been sent down, I shall surely chastise him with a chastisement wherewith I chastise no other being from among all the worlds\u0027: and so the angels descended with it from heaven, on it were seven loaves and seven large fish, and so they ate of it until they were full, as related by Ibn \u0060Abbs. In one hadth it is said that the Table sent down from heaven consisted of bread and meat, and they were commanded not to be treacherous and nor to store anything for the next day: but they were and they stored some of it, and were [consequently] transformed into apes and swine.",
  "And, mention, when God says, that is, when God will say, to Jesus at the Resurrection in rebuke of his followers: \u0060O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to mankind, \u0022Take me and my mother as gods, besides God\u0022?\u0027 He, Jesus, says, shuddering: \u0060Glory be to You!, exalted be You above all that does not befit You, such as [having] a partner and so on. It is not mine, it is unjustified [for me], to say what I have no right to (bi- haqq, \u0060right to\u0027, is the predicate of laysa, \u0060not\u0027; l, \u0060mine\u0027, is explicative).

  "If you chastise them, that is, those among them who are fixed upon disbelief, verily they are Your servants, and You are their Master, disposing of them as You will: there can be no objection to [what] You [do]; and if You forgive them, that is, those of them who are believers, You, only You, are the Mighty, in His affair, the Wise\u0027, in His actions.",
  "God says, \u0060This, namely, the Day of Resurrection, is the day those who were truthful, in the world, like Jesus, shall profit by their truthfulness, because this is the Day of Requital. Theirs will be Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever. God is well-pleased with them, because of their obedience to Him, and they are well-pleased with Him, with His reward -- that is the great triumph\u0027. The sincerity of those who were liars in this world shall not avail them on that Day, just as [it shall not avail] the disbelievers when they believe upon seeing the chastisement.",

  "Praise, which means to describe in beautiful terms, be, [ever] established, to God: is this meant to be informative, so that one believes in it? Or, is it meant as a eulogy, or both? These are three possibilities, the most likely of which is the last, as the Shaykh [Jall al-Dn al-Mahall] states in [his commentary on] srat al- Kahf [Q. 18:1]; Who created the heavens and the earth -- He singles out these two for mention because for the observer they constitute the most awesome [visible] creation; and He appointed, He created, darknesses and light, that is, every darkness (zulma) and every light: the use of the plural only in the case of the former is because it [darkness] has many causes; and this is one of the proofs of His Oneness; then those who disbelieve, despite the existence of this proof, ascribe equals to their Lord, they worship others equally.",
  "It is He Who created you from clay, by creating your father Adam from it; then He decreed a term, for [each of] you, at the conclusion of which you die. A term is stated, fixed, with Him, for your resurrection; yet thereafter you, O disbelievers, doubt, you are uncertain about the Resurrection, when you know that it was He Who initiated your creation, and One Who has the power to initiate [creation], is even more capable of bringing you back [to life after death].",

Then We destroyed them because of their sins, because of their denial of the prophets; and We raised up after them another generation.",
  "And had We revealed to you a Scripture, inscribed, on parchment, as they requested, and had they then touched it with their hands -- this is more powerful than saying, \u0060had they seen it with their eyes\u0027, since it [touch] is more effective in eliminating doubt; the disbelievers would have said, in disobedience and obduracy: \u0060This is nothing but manifest sorcery\u0027.",
  "And they say, \u0060Why has an angel not been sent down to him?\u0027, to Muhammad (s), to confirm his truthfulness; yet had We sent down an angel, as they have requested and if they then did not believe, the matter, that they be destroyed, would have been decreed, and then they would not be given any respite, they would [not] be given any extra time for repentance or an excuse, as is God\u0027s custom [in dealing] with those before them, destroying them when they disbelieve after their request is granted.",
  "And had We appointed him, the one who is sent down to them, an angel, We would assuredly have made him, the angel, a man, that is, [We would have sent him] in the form of a man, so that they would be able to see him, since no human being is capable of seeing an angel; and, had We sent him down and made him a man, We would have assuredly confused, obscured, for them what they are confusing, for themselves, when they say, \u0060This is but a mere mortal like the rest of you\u0027.",
  "And messengers were indeed mocked before you -- this is meant as a consolation for the Prophet, (s) -- but those who scoffed at them were encompassed by that which they mocked, namely, [by the] punishment [sent down on them]: those who mock you will be encompassed likewise.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Travel in the land, and see the nature of the consequence for the deniers\u0027, of the messengers, how they were destroyed through chastisement; perhaps they will take heed.",
  "Say: \u0060To whom belongs what is in the heavens and in the earth?\u0027 Say: \u0060To God, for even if they do not say this, there is no other response. He has prescribed, He has decreed, for Himself mercy, as a bounty from Him -- this is a gentle summoning of them to the faith. He will surely gather you together on the Day of Resurrection of which there is no doubt, no uncertainty, in order to requite you for your deeds.

And if they were to see every sign, they would not believe in it, so that when they come to you to argue with you, the disbelievers say, \u0060This, Qur\u0027n, is nothing but the fables, the lies, of the ancients\u0027, similar to [their] jokes and strange tales (astr, \u0060fables\u0027, is the plural of ustra).",
  "And, to people, they forbid it, the following of the Prophet (s), and keep away from it, and so they do not believe in him: it is said that this was revealed regarding Ab Tlib, who used to forbid [people from] hurting him, but did not [himself] believe in him; and it is only themselves they destroy, when they keep away from him, because the harm thereof will befall them, but they do not perceive, this.",
  "If you, O Muhammad (s), could see when they are made to stand, [when] they are exposed, before the Fire, and they say, \u0060Oh (y is for exclamation) would that we might be returned, to the world; then we would not deny the signs of our Lord, but we would be among the believers!\u0027 (read nukadhdhibu and naknu as a new [independent] sentence; or read nukadhdhiba and nakna as the [subjunctive] response to the optative [clause]; or read nukadhdhibu and nakna).

Say, to them: \u0060Surely God has the power to send down (read yunazzil or yunzil) a sign, from among those they have requested, but most of them do not know\u0027, that its sending down would be a trial for them, for if they then [still] denied it, they would necessarily be destroyed.",

  "And those who deny Our signs, the Qur\u0027n, are deaf, to hearing them in such a way so as to accept [them], and dumb, [unable] to utter truth, in darkness, in unbelief. He whom God wills, to send astray, He sends astray, and whom He wills, to guide, He sets him on a straight path, [a straight] road, the religion of Islam.",
  "Say, O Muhammad (s), to the Meccans: \u0060Do you see yourselves, [that is] inform me, if God\u0027s chastisement comes upon you, in this world, or the Hour, the Resurrection, which includes this [chastisement], comes upon you, suddenly, will ye call upon any other than God? No! If you speak truly!\u0027, that the idols can benefit you, then call upon them.",
  "Nay; upon Him, and upon none other, you will call, in [times of] tribulation, and He will remove that which you call upon Him, to remove from you, such things as suffering, if He wills, to remove it, and you will forget, you will neglect, what you associate with Him, of idols and will not call them.",
  "Indeed We sent to communities before you (min qablika: min is extra), messengers, but they denied them, and We seized them with misery, abject poverty, and hardship, illness, so that they might be humble, abased, that they might believe.",
  "If only, when Our might, Our punishment, came upon them, they had been humble, in other words, they were not so, even though the necessitating factor was there. But their hearts were hard, and would not yield to faith, and Satan adorned for them what they were doing, in the way of disobedient acts, and so they persisted in them.",
  "So, when they forgot, [when] they neglected, that whereof they were reminded, that with which they were admonished and threatened, in the way of misery and hardship; and they did not heed the admonition, We opened (read fatahn or fattahn) to them the gates of all things, in the way of graces, in order to draw them on by degrees, until, when they rejoiced in what they were given, a wanton rejoicing, We seized them suddenly, with chastisement, and lo! they were confounded, despairing of anything good.",
  "So the last remnant of the people who did evil was cut off, by having them annihilated. Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds, for giving victory to the messengers and destroying the disbelievers.",
  "Say, to the people of Mecca: \u0060Have you considered, inform me, if God were to seize your hearing, [if] He were to make you deaf, and your sight, [if] He were to make you blind, and set, stamp, a seal upon your hearts, so that you no longer knew anything, who is the god other than God to give it back to you?\u0027, that which He took away from you, as you [are wont to] claim? See how We dispense, [how] We make clear, the signs, the proofs of Our Oneness! Yet thereafter they are turning away, they reject them and do not believe.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Have you considered for yourselves, if God\u0027s chastisement were to come upon you, suddenly or openly?, at night or during the day; Would any be destroyed, except the evildoing, the unbelieving, folk?\u0027 That is to say, none but these will be destroyed.",
  "We do not send messengers, except as bearers of good tidings, to those who believe, [good tidings] of Paradise, and as warners, to those who disbelieve, [warning] of the Fire. Whoever believes, in them, and makes amends, in his deeds, no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve, in the Hereafter.",
  "But those who deny Our signs, the chastisement shall afflict them because they were wicked, rebelling against obedience.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060I do not say to you, \u0022I possess the treasure houses of God\u0022, from which He provides sustenance; and I do not have knowledge of the Unseen, that which is hidden from me and has not been revealed to me. And I do not say to you, \u0022I am an angel\u0022, from among the angels; I only follow what is revealed to me.\u0027 Say: \u0060Is the blind man, the disbeliever, equal to the seeing man, the believer? No! Will you not then reflect\u0027 upon this and believe?",
  "And warn, threaten, therewith, that is, [with] the Qur\u0027n, those who fear they shall be gathered to their Lord: apart from Him, other than Him, they have no protector, to help them, and no intercessor, to intercede for them (the negative sentence stands as a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of [the verb] yuhshar, \u0060they shall be gathered\u0027, and constitutes the object of [what they] fear) -- the sinning believers are meant here; so that they might be wary, of God, by desisting from what they engage in and performing deeds of obedience.",
  "And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord at morning and evening desiring, through their worship, His countenance, exalted be He, and not [desiring] any of the transient things of this world -- and these are the poor. The idolaters had reviled them and demanded that he [the Prophet] expel them, so that they could sit with him. The Prophet (s) wanted [to do] this, because of his desire that they become Muslims. You are not accountable for them in anything (min shay\u0027in: min is extra), if what they hide in themselves be displeasing; nor are they accountable for you in anything, that you should drive them away (this is the response to the negative sentence) and be of the evildoers, if you do this.",
  "And even so We have tried, We have tested, some of them by others, that is, the noble one by the commoner, the rich man by the poor man, preferring the [latter] one by giving [him] precedence in [attaining] faith, so that they, the noble ones and the rich, may say, in disavowal, \u0060Are these, the poor, the ones whom God has favoured from among us?\u0027, with guidance? In other words [so that they may say]: if what they follow is [true] guidance, they would not have preceded us [in attaining it]. God, exalted be He, says: Is God not best aware of those who are thankful?, to Him, to guide them? Indeed [He is].",
  "And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, say, to them: \u0060Peace be upon you. Your Lord has prescribed, He has decreed, for Himself mercy, to the effect that, truly (innahu, \u0060truly\u0027, may also be read as annahu, \u0060that\u0027, as a substitution for al-rahma, \u0060mercy\u0027) whoever of you does evil in ignorance, of it when he did it, and repents thereafter, after his [evil] deed, [repents] of it, and makes amends, in his actions -- truly He, God, is Forgiving, Merciful\u0027, towards him (a variant reading [for innahu, \u0060truly He\u0027] has annahu, \u0060then He\u0027), in other words, forgiveness shall be for him.",
  "And thus, in the same way that We have explained what has been mentioned, We distinguish, We expound, the signs, the Qur\u0027n, so that truth becomes manifest and is implemented in [people\u0027s] deeds, and that the way, the path, of the sinners may be become clear, evident, and hence avoided (wa-li-yastabna may also be read wa-li-tastabna, \u0060that you may discern\u0027, with sabla, \u0060the way\u0027, read in the accusative [as opposed to the nominative, sablu], implying a direct address to the Prophet [s]).",
  "Say: \u0060Truly I have been forbidden to worship those whom you call upon, [those whom] you worship, besides God.\u0027 Say: \u0060I shall not follow your whims, by worshipping them, for then, if I did follow them, verily I would have gone astray and I would not be of the rightly guided\u0027.",
  "Say: \u0060I am upon a clear proof, a [clear] statement, from my Lord, and you have, already, denied Him, my Lord, when you associated others with Him. I do not have that which you seek to hasten, of the chastisement; the judgement, in this matter and in [all] others, is God\u0027s alone. He decrees the, judgement of, truth, and He is the Best of Deciders\u0027, [the Best of] Judges (a variant reading [for yaqd, \u0060He decrees\u0027] has yaqussu, that is, \u0060He relates [the truth]\u0027).",
  "Say, to them: \u0060If I did have what you seek to hasten, the matter between you and me would have been decided, by my hastening it for you, so that I might find rest; but God has it; and God knows best the evildoers\u0027, and when to punish them.",
  "And with Him, exalted be He, are the keys of the Unseen, its treasure houses, or the paths that lead to knowledge of it; none but He knows them, and these are the five things mentioned in His saying: Surely God, He has knowledge of the Hour [and He sends down the rain and He knows what is in the wombs. And no soul knows what it has earned for the morrow; nor does any soul know in what land it will die. Truly God is Knowing, Aware, Q. 31:34], as reported by al-Bukhr. He knows what is, happening, on land, [in] the deserts, and in the waters, [in] the towns along the rivers; and not a leaf (min waraqatin: min is extra) falls, but He knows it. Not a grain in the shadows of the earth, nothing of wet or dry ([this entire clause] wa-l habbatin f zulumti l-ardi wa-l ratbin wa-l ybisin is a supplement to waraqatin, \u0060a leaf\u0027) but it is in a clear book, namely, the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahfz). The exceptive clause [ill f kitbin mubn, \u0060but it is in a clear book\u0027] constitutes an inclusive substitution for the previous exceptive clause [ill ya\u0060lamuh, \u0060but He knows it\u0027].",
  "It is He Who takes you at night, seizing your spirits during sleep, and He knows what you commit, [what] you earn, by day. Then He raises you up therein, that is, in the daytime, by restoring your spirits, so that an appointed term, namely, the term of life, may be accomplished; and afterward to Him is your return, through resurrection. Then He will inform you of what you used to do, and so requite you for it.",
  "He is the Vanquisher, Superior, over His servants. And He sends guardians over you, angels, to record your deeds, until, when death approaches one of you, Our messengers, the angels charged with the seizing of the spirits, take him (tawaffathu; a variant reading has tawaffhu) and they neglect not, they do not fall short of what they have been commanded.",
  "Then they, creatures, are restored to God their Protector, their Possessor, the True, the Eternal, the Just, so that He might requite them. Surely His is the judgement, the decree that will be carried out in their case. He is the swiftest of reckoners, reckoning with the whole of creation in half a day of the days of this world, on the basis of a hadth to this effect.",
  "Say, O Muhammad (s), to the people of Mecca: \u0060Who delivers you from the darkness of the land and the sea, [from] their terrors, during your journeys? When, you call upon Him openly and secretly, saying: \u0022Verily, if (la-in, the lm is for oaths) You, God, deliver us (anjaytan, is also read anjn, \u0060[if] He delivers us\u0027), from this, darkness and hardship, we shall truly be among the thankful\u0022\u0027, the believers.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060God delivers you (read yunjkum or yunajjkum) from that and from every distress, [from every] other anxiety. Yet you associate others with Him\u0027.",
  "Say: \u0060He has the power to send forth upon you a chastisement from above you, from the heaven, such as stones [cf. Q. 8:32] or a Cry [cf. Q. 11:67], or from beneath your feet, such as the causing of the earth to cave in [cf. Q. 29:40], or to confound you, to confuse you, in parties, sects with differing whims, and to make you taste the violence of one another\u0027, through fighting. When this [verse] was revealed, the Prophet (s) said, \u0060This [chastisement etc.] is easier and lighter\u0027; but when the last statement was revealed, he said, \u0060I seek refuge with Your Countenance!\u0027, as reported by al-Bukhr. Muslim reports the [following] hadth: \u0060I requested from my Lord not to make my community violent towards each other, but He denied me this [request]\u0027. In another hadth, when it was revealed, he [is reported to have] said, \u0060As for this, it will surely come to pass, even though its proper meaning has not yet come\u0027. See how We dispense, [how] We clarify for them, the signs, the proofs of Our power, that perhaps they might understand, that they might realise that what they follow is falsehood.",
  "Your people have denied it, the Qur\u0027n. Yet it is the truth. Say, to them: \u0060I am not a guardian over you, to requite you. I am only a warner and your affair is left to God -- this was [revealed] before the command to fight [the idolaters].",
  "Every tiding, [every] announcement, has a conclusion, a [fixed] time in which it will take place and be concluded, including [the tiding concerning] your punishment. And you will come to know\u0027 -- this is a threat for them.",
  "When you see those who engage in discourse about Our signs, the Qur\u0027n, in mockery, turn away from them, and do not sit with them, until they discourse on some other topic. And if (imm: the letter nn of the conditional particle in has been assimilated with the extra m) Satan should make you forget (read yunsiyannaka or yunassiyannaka), and you sit with them, then do not sit, after the reminder, that is, [after] you remember, with the evildoing folk (the overt noun [al-qawm al-zlimn, \u0060the evildoing folk\u0027] replaces the [third person] pronominalisation).",
  "The Muslims then said, \u0060If we get up [and leave] every time they delve [into the matter of the Qur\u0027n], we would never be able to sit in the Mosque or perform circumambulations. Therefore, the following was revealed: Those who fear God, are not accountable for them, [for] those who discourse [in mockery], in anything (min shay\u0027in: min is extra), if they should sit with them; but it is the reminder, that they are accountable for; [a reminder given] to make them remember and to admonish them, so that perhaps they will be wary, of discoursing thus.",
  "And forsake, leave alone, those who take their religion, with which they have been charged, as a game and a diversion, making a mockery of it, and whom the life of this world has deluded, and so do not interfere with them -- this was [revealed] before the command to fight [them]. Remind, admonish people, thereby, by the Qur\u0027n, lest a soul perish, [lest] it be given up for destruction, for what it has earned, what it has done; it has no protector, [no] helper, besides God, other than Him, and no intercessor, to ward off the chastisement from it; and though it offer every compensation, [though] it pay every ransom, it shall not be accepted from it, that which it offers as ransom. Those are the ones who perish by what they have earned; for them shall be a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement, because they disbelieved, that is, for their unbelief.",
  "Say: \u0060Shall we call upon, shall we worship, instead of God, that which neither profits us, if we worship them, nor hurts us, if we neglect [to worship] them -- these are the idols; and so be turned back, [and so] return to idolatry, after God has guided us, to Islam? -- Like one whom the devils have lured, led astray, in the earth, bewildered, confused, not knowing where to go (hayrn, \u0060bewildered\u0027, is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the [suffixed pronoun] h\u0027 [of istahwat-hu, \u0060whom they have lured\u0027]); he has companions, a group, who call him to guidance, that is to say, [they are there] in order to guide him to the [right] path, saying to him: \u0022Come to us!\u0022\u0027, but he does not respond to them, and he perishes (the interrogative statement is meant as a disavowal; the comparative statement [beginning with ka\u0027lladh, \u0060like one whom\u0027] is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject [of the verb] nuraddu, \u0060be turned back\u0027).

And, mention, the day He says, to a thing, \u0060Be\u0027, and it is -- this is the Day of Resurrection, when He says to creatures, \u0060Rise up\u0027, and they do. His words are the truth, the truth that will doubtless come to pass; and His is the Kingdom the day when the trumpet, the horn, is blown, the second blast by [the angel] Isrfl, when there shall be no kingdom for any other than Him: \u0060Whose is the Kingdom today? God\u0027s\u0027 [Q. 40:16]. He is the Knower of the Unseen and the visible, what is hidden and what may be seen.

  "And, mention, when Abraham said to his father zar, which was his cognomen, his [first] name being Terah (Trikh): \u0060Do you take idols as gods, to worship? (an interrogative meant as a rebuke). I see you and your people, by [this act of] taking them [as gods], in manifest error\u0027, far from the truth.",
  "And so, just as We show him the misguidance of his father and his people, We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might infer thereby [the truth of] Our Oneness, and that he might be of those knowing, it, with certainty (the sentence beginning with wa-kadhlika, \u0060and so\u0027, and what follows it, is a parenthetical statement and a supplement to [the one beginning with] qla, \u0060he said\u0027).",
  "When night descended, [when] it darkened, upon him he saw a star -- said to have been Venus -- and said, to his people, who were astrologers: \u0060This is my Lord\u0027, as you [are wont to] claim. But when it set, when it disappeared, he said, \u0060I love not those that set\u0027, to take them as lords, because it is not possible for a [true] Lord to be transformed or to change place, as such [attributes] pertain to accidents -- but this had no effect on them.",
  "And when he saw the moon rising, appearing, he said, to them: \u0060This is my Lord.\u0027 But when it set he said, \u0060Unless my Lord guides me, [unless] He establishes me within [true] guidance, I shall surely become one of the folk who are astray\u0027 -- an intimation to his people that they are astray, but still this had no effect on them.",
  "And when he saw the sun rising, he said, \u0060This is my Lord; this is greater!\u0027 than the star and the moon (the masculine [demonstrative pronoun] hdh, \u0060this\u0027, is used [for the feminine shams, \u0060sun\u0027] because the predicate [rabb, \u0060my Lord\u0027] is masculine). But when it set, and the argument against them had become stronger and they still had not repented, he said, \u0060O my people, surely I am innocent of what you associate, with God, in the way of idols and accidental bodies, which require an originator. They then asked him, \u0060What do you worship?\u0027",
  "He said: Verily I have turned my face to, I am seeking in worship, Him Who originated, created, the heavens and the earth, namely, God; a hanf, inclining towards the upright religion, and I am not of those that associate others\u0027, with Him.",
  "But his people disputed with him, they argued with him about his religion and threatened him that the idols would strike him with evil if he abandoned them.

I have no fear of what you associate with Him, in the way of idols, that they might strike me with some evil, since they have no power to do anything, unless my Lord wills something, harmful to befall me and it does. My Lord encompasses all things through His knowledge; will you not remember, this and believe?",
  "How should I fear what you have associated, with God, when it can neither profit nor harm, and you fear not, God [in], that you have associated with God, in worship, that for which He has not revealed to you any warrant?\u0027, [any] argument or proof, when He has power over all things. Which of the two parties has more right to security, is it us or you, if you have any knowledge, of who has more right? In other words: it is us, so follow Him. God, exalted be He, says:",

We raise up in degrees whom We will (read this as [a genitive] annexation, darajti man nash\u0027, or as [accusative] nunation, darajtin man nash\u0027), [degrees] in knowledge and wisdom; surely your Lord is Wise, in His actions, Knowing, of His creation.",

  "Vision cannot attain Him, that is, they [the eyes] cannot see Him -- this is [a denial that applies] in particular [circumstances], since [it is accepted] that the believer will see Him in the Hereafter, as indicated by God\u0027s words, On that Day faces shall be radiant, gazing upon their Lord [Q. 75:22f.], and by the hadth of the two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim]: \u0060Verily you shall see your Lord, as clearly as you see the full moon at night\u0027) -- and it is also said [to mean] that it [vision] cannot encompass Him; but He attains [all] vision, that is to say, He perceives them, whereas they cannot perceive Him; it is not possible in [the case of] anyone other than Him to attain all vision while it [vision] cannot attain Him or encompass Him in knowledge. And He is the Subtle, [in dealing] with His friends, the Aware, of them.",
  "Say, O Muhammad (s), to them: Clear proofs have come to you from your Lord; whoever perceives, them and believes, then it is for his own good, that he has perceived [them], since the reward resulting from his perception will be his; and whoever is blind, to them and goes astray, then it, the evil consequence of his being astray, will be to his own hurt. And I am not a keeper, a watcher, over you, of your deeds: I am but a warner.",
  "And so, in the same way that We have explained what has been mentioned, We dispense, We elucidate, the signs, that they might take heed, and that they, the disbelievers, may say, at the end of this: \u0060You have studied with someone\u0027, that you have consulted with (drasta) the People of the Scripture or [that] you have studied (darasta, variant reading) the scriptures of past peoples and brought this [Qur\u0027n] therefrom; and that We may make it clear for a people who have knowledge.",
  "Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord, namely, the Qur\u0027n. There is no god but Him; and turn away from the idolaters.",
  "Had God willed, they would not have been idolaters; and We have not set you as a keeper over them, a watcher, so that you might then requite them for their deeds; nor are you a guardian over them, so that you might [be able to] coerce them to faith -- this was [revealed] before the command to fight [them].",
  "Do not revile those whom they call upon, besides God, namely, the idols, lest they then revile God out of spite, out of aggression and wrongfully, through ignorance, that is, through their ignorance of God. So, in the same way that We have adorned for these that which they practise, We have adorned for every community their, good and evil, deeds, and they commit them; then to their Lord they shall return, in the Hereafter, and He will tell them what they used to do, and requite them for it.",
  "They, that is, the disbelievers of Mecca, have sworn by God the most earnest oaths that if there came to them a sign, of what they requested, they will believe in it. Say, to them: \u0060Signs are only with God\u0027, and He sends them down as [and when] He wills; I am but a warner. But what will make you realise?, how would you know if they have believed, if these [signs] did come [to them]? In other words, you would not know this; truly, when they come, they will not believe, because of what I already know (a variant reading [for l yu\u0027minna, \u0060they will not believe\u0027] has l tu\u0027minna, \u0060you will not believe\u0027, making the address to the disbelievers; another [variant reading] has annah [instead of innah, \u0060that truly\u0027] as meaning la\u0060alla, \u0060that perhaps\u0027, or as governed by the preceding clause [la\u0027in j\u0027athum yatun, \u0060if there came to them a sign\u0027).",
  "And We shall confound their hearts, We shall turn their hearts away from the truth, so that they cannot understand it, and their eyes, away from it, so that they do not see it and thus do not believe; just as they did not believe in it, that is, in the verses that have been revealed, the first time; and We shall leave them in their insolence, in their misguidance, wandering blindly, hesitating, perplexed.",
  "And if We had sent down the angels to them, and the dead had spoken with them, as they have requested, and We had gathered against them all things in droves (read qubulan, plural of qabl, meaning \u0060throng upon throng\u0027, or read qibalan, meaning \u0060before their very eyes\u0027), and they were witness to your truthfulness, yet they would not have believed, as God already knows, unless God willed, that they believe and they did; but most of them are ignorant, of this.",
  "And so We have appointed to every Prophet an enemy, just as We have appointed these your enemies (and this [\u0060adwwan, \u0060an enemy\u0027, is substituted by [the following, shaytn, \u0060devils\u0027]) devils, the rebels, of mankind and jinn who inspire, whisper, fine speech to each other, the falsehood that is disguised as such [fine speech], in delusion, that is, in order to delude them; yet, had your Lord willed, they would never have done it, that mutual inspiration. So leave them, let the disbelievers be, with what they fabricate, of disbelief and otherwise, of what has been adorned for them -- this was [revealed] before the command to fight [them].",
  "And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to it (wa-li-tasgh is a supplement to [the above] ghurran, \u0060in delusion\u0027), that is, [to] that fine [speech], and that they may be pleased with it, and that they may acquire, earn, what they are acquiring, of sins, and be punished for it.",
  "The following was revealed when they asked the Prophet (s) to appoint an arbiter between him and themselves. Say: Shall I seek, demand, other than God as a judge, an arbiter between you and me, when it is He Who revealed to you the Book, the Qur\u0027n, clearly explained?, wherein truth is distinguished from falsehood. Those to whom We have given the Scripture, the Torah, the likes of \u0060Abd Allh b. Salm and his companions, know that it is revealed (read munzal or munazzal) from your Lord in truth; so do not be of the waverers, the doubters, regarding it: this is intended to affirm to the disbelievers that it is the truth.",
  "Perfected is the word of your Lord, in the way of rulings and appointed terms, in truthfulness and justice (sidqan wa-\u0060adlan is for specification); none can change His words, either by contravening [His rulings] or evading [His appointed terms]. He is the Hearing, of what is said, the Knowing, of what is done.",
  "If you obey most of those on earth, that is, the disbelievers, they will lead you astray from the way of God, [from] His religion; they follow only supposition, when they dispute with you concerning [the status of] carrion, saying: \u0060What God has killed is more worthy of your consumption than what you kill yourselves!\u0027; they are merely guessing, speaking falsehood in this [matter].",
  "Your Lord knows best those who stray from His way and He knows well the rightly guided, and will requite both of them.",
  "So eat from that over which God\u0027s Name has been invoked, that is, [that which] has been sacrificed to His Name, if you believe in His signs.",
  "What is wrong with you, that you do not eat from that over which God\u0027s Name has been invoked, of sacrifices, when He has detailed (for both verbs, read the passive [fussila, \u0060it has been detailed\u0027, and hurrima, \u0060[that which] has been forbidden\u0027] or the active [fassala, \u0060He has detailed\u0027, and harrama, \u0060[what] He has forbidden\u0027]) for you what He has forbidden, in the verse: Forbidden to you is carrion ... [Q. 5:3], except that to which you are compelled?, thereof, which is also lawful for you. The meaning is: there is nothing to prevent you from eating what has been mentioned, for He has explained to you what is forbidden for consumption, and that [over which God\u0027s Name has been invoked] is not among these [forbidden things]. But truly many are led astray (read la-yadillna, \u0060[many] are led astray\u0027, or la-yudillna, \u0060[many] lead [others] astray\u0027), by their whims, by what their own selves fancy, in the way of permitting [the consumption of] carrion and otherwise, without any knowledge, with which to support their claims. Truly your Lord knows the transgressors, those who overstep [the bounds] of what is lawful into what is unlawful.",
  "And forsake, leave, outward aspect of sin and its inward aspect, that is, what is overt of it and what is secret -- it is said that \u0060sin\u0027 here means fornication, or, it is said, any act of disobedience; surely those who earn sin shall be requited, in the Hereafter, for what they used to perpetrate, [what] they used to earn.",
  "And do not eat from that over which God\u0027s Name has not been invoked, where it has died or been sacrificed to other than His Name -- otherwise, what a Muslim sacrifices and does not invoke God\u0027s Name over, whether intentionally or forgetfully, is lawful, as was stated by Ibn \u0060Abbs, and this is the opinion of al-Shfi\u0060 -- verily it, the eating thereof, is wickedness, a contravention of what is lawful. And truly the devils inspire, whisper [to], their friends, the disbelievers, to dispute with you, in deeming carrion lawful; and if you obey them, in this [matter], you are truly idolaters.",
  "The following was revealed regarding Ab Jahl and others: Why, is he who was dead, through unbelief, and We gave him life, through guidance, and appointed for him a light by which to walk among people, distinguishing thereby the truth from falsehood -- this [light] being faith -- as him whose likeness (ka-man mathaluhu: mathal, \u0060likeness\u0027, is extra; in other words, [read] ka-man huwa, \u0060as him who\u0027) is in darkness whence he cannot emerge? -- and this is the disbeliever -- No! So, in the same way that faith has been adorned for believers, what the disbelievers have been doing, in the way of disbelief and acts of disobedience, has been adorned for them.",
  "And thus, in the same way that We have made the wicked folk of Mecca its leaders, We have made in every city its sinners great ones, that they may plot therein, to impede the faith; but they plot only against themselves, because the evil consequences thereof will befall them, though they do not perceive, this.",
  "And when a sign, of the truth of the Prophet (s), comes to them, the people of Mecca, they say, \u0060We will not believe, in him, until we are given the like of what God\u0027s messengers were given\u0027, in the way of a message and inspiration to us, because we are wealthier and more senior in years. God, exalted be He, says: God knows best where to place His Message (read plural [risltihi, \u0060His Messages\u0027] or singular [rislatahu, \u0060His Message\u0027]; hayth, \u0060where\u0027, constitutes the direct object because of the verb [ya\u0060lam, \u0060He knows\u0027] implicit in a\u0060lam, \u0060the best knower\u0027) that is to say, He knows the right place for it to be placed in, and He thus places it [there] -- these people, however, are not worthy of it. Humiliation from God and a terrible chastisement shall smite those who have sinned, by saying this, for their plotting.",
  "Whomever God desires to guide, He expands his breast to Islam, by casting into his heart a light which it [the heart] expands for and accepts, as reported in a hadth; and whomever He, God, desires to send astray, He makes his breast narrow (read dayqan or dayyiqan), [unable] to accept it, and constricted, extremely tight (read harijan, \u0060constricted\u0027, as an adjective, or harajan as a verbal noun, by which it [the heart of the misguided one] is described hyperbolically) as if he were engaged in ascent (yassa\u0060\u0060ad, is also read as yass\u0060ad: in both [forms] the original t\u0027 has been assimilated with the sd; a third [variant reading] has yas\u0060ad) to the heaven, when he is charged with [the obligations of] the faith, because of the hardship for him therein. So, like this making [of the breast narrow], God casts ignominy, chastisement, or [He casts] Satan, that is, He gives him authority, over those who do not believe.",
  "And this, [path] that you follow, O Muhammad (s), is the path of your Lord, a straight one, with no crookedness therein (mustaqman, \u0060straight\u0027, is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier emphasising the [previous] statement, and it is operated by the import of the demonstrative noun [hdh, \u0060this\u0027]). We have detailed, We have elucidated, the signs for a people who remember (yadhdhakkarn: the original t\u0027 has been assimilated with the dhl), that is to say, [a people] who heed admonition -- such [people] are singled out for mention because they are the ones to profit [from the signs].",
  "Theirs will be the abode of peace, namely, Paradise, with their Lord, and He will be their Friend because of what they used to do.",
  "And, mention, the day when He, God, shall gather them (yahshuruhum, may also read nahshuruhum, \u0060We shall gather them\u0027), that is, creatures, all together, and it will be said to them: \u0060O assembly of jinn, you have garnered much of mankind\u0027, by your misleading [them]. Then their friends, those who obeyed them, from among mankind will say, \u0060Our Lord, we enjoyed one another, mankind enjoyed what the jinn adorned for them of passions, while the jinn [enjoyed] mankind\u0027s obedience to them; but now we have arrived at the term which You have appointed for us\u0027, that is, the Day of Resurrection -- this [statement] expresses extreme regret on their part. He, exalted be He, will say, to them, by the tongues of the angels: \u0060The Fire is your lodging, your abode, to abide therein\u0027 -- except what God wills, of those times when they will exit from it in order to drink boiling water, which is located outside it, as God, exalted be He, has said: Then they shall return to the Hell-fire [Q. 37:68]; according to Ibn \u0060Abbs, this [proviso] pertains to those whom God knows will believe (m, \u0060what\u0027, thus has the sense of man, \u0060whom\u0027). Surely your Lord is Wise, in His actions, Knowing, of His creatures.",
  "So, just as We let the rebels from among mankind and jinn enjoy one another, We let some of the evildoers have power over others because of what they are wont to earn, of acts of disobedience.",
  "\u0060O assembly of jinn and mankind, did not messengers come to you from among you, that is, from among both of your number -- which holds true in the case of mankind [since messengers came from among them], or [by \u0060messengers\u0027 if the jinn are meant] those messengers among the jinn who are their warners, the ones who listen to the speech of the [human] messengers and convey it to their kind -- to recount to you My signs and to warn you of the encounter of this Day of yours?\u0027 They shall say, \u0060We bear witness against ourselves\u0027, that [all] this was conveyed to us. God, exalted be He, says: And the life of this world deluded them, and so they did not believe. And they bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers.",
  "That, sending of the messengers, is because (an, [phonetically] lightened, with the lm [of li-annahu] implied, thus [read as] li-annahu, \u0060because\u0027) your Lord would never destroy the towns through injustice, on their part, while their inhabitants were heedless, not having had any Messenger to make [things] clear to them.",
  "All, of those who perform deeds, shall have degrees, of requital, according to what they have done, of good or evil. Your Lord is not heedless of what they do (ya\u0060malna: may also be read ta\u0060malna, \u0060you do\u0027).",
  "Your Lord is Independent, of His creatures and their worship, the Lord of Mercy. If He will, He can remove you, O people of Mecca, by destroying you, and leave whom He will, of creatures, to succeed after you, just as He produced you from the seed of another folk, [whom] He removed; but He has spared you, as a mercy to you.",
  "Truly, that which you are promised, of the Hour and chastisement, will surely come to pass, inevitably, and you cannot escape, [you cannot] elude Our chastisement.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060O my people, act according to your state, your circumstances; truly I am acting, according to my circumstances. And assuredly you will know whose (man: the relative particle introducing the object of the verb \u0060you will know\u0027) sequel shall be the abode, that is, [who shall have] the praiseworthy sequel in the abode of the Hereafter: will it be us or yourselves? Surely the evildoers, the disbelievers, will not prosper\u0027, will not find happiness.",
  "They, the disbelievers of Mecca, assign to God, of the tillage, the crops, and the cattle which He multiplied, He created, a portion, which they dispense to visitors and the needy, and to their associates belongs a portion, which they dispense to such keepers [of the tillage and cattle], saying, \u0060This is for God\u0027 -- so they assert (read bi-za\u0060mihim or bi-zu\u0060mihim) -- \u0060and this is for our associates\u0027: and if any of the portion of these [associates] fell into God\u0027s portion, they used to restore it [to that of their associates], but when something of His portion fell into theirs, they would leave it there, saying, \u0060God is Independent [and is not in need] of this\u0027, as God, exalted be He, says: So that which is intended for their associates does not reach God, and that which is intended for God does reach their associates. Evil is that, provision of theirs, which they decree!",
  "And thus, in the same way that what is mentioned was adorned for them, those associates of theirs, from among the jinn, have adorned for many of the idolaters the slaying of their children, by burying them alive (shurak\u0027uhum, \u0060those associates of theirs\u0027, is read in the nominative as the subject of the verb zayyana, \u0060adorned\u0027; an alternative reading has the passive [zuyyina, \u0060it has been adorned\u0027], with qatlu, \u0060the slaying\u0027, in the nominative [as the subject of this passive verb], awldahum, \u0060their children\u0027, in the accusative on account of it [being the direct object of qatlu, \u0060the slaying\u0027], and shurak\u0027ihim in the genitive as an annexation to qatlu, so that the object in this case intervenes between the two elements of the annexation [qatlu awldahum shurak\u0027ihim, \u0060their associates killing the children\u0027] -- this is acceptable [syntactically] -- and the annexation of qatlu to shurak\u0027ihim [in this latter reading] is on account of them [the associates] commanding [the idolaters to do] this), that they may destroy them and to confuse, to make obscure, their religion for them. Had God willed, they would not have done so; so leave them and that which they fabricate.",
  "They say, \u0060These cattle and tillage are sacrosanct, forbidden. No one is to eat of them except whom we will\u0027, from among the retainers of the graven images and others -- so they assert, in other words, they have no [convincing] argument for it -- \u0060and cattle whose backs have been forbidden, and cannot therefore be ridden, such as the camels [they call] S\u0027ibas or Hms, and cattle over which they do not invoke the Name of God\u0027, when they slaughter them, invoking instead the names of their idols, ascribing such [rules] to God; forging lies against Him. He will assuredly requite them for what they used to fabricate, against Him.",
  "And they say, \u0060That which is within the bellies of these, forbidden, cattle, namely, the camels [they call] S\u0027ibas or Bahras, is reserved, permitted, for our males and forbidden to our spouses, that is, the women; but if it be dead (read maytatun or maytatan, and the verb as either feminine takun or masculine yakun, \u0060if it be\u0027) then they [all] may be partakers thereof\u0027. He, God, will assuredly requite them for their describing, [this and] that as [either] permitted or forbidden, with the appropriate requital thereof. Surely He is Wise, in His actions, Knowing, of His creatures.",
  "They are losers who slay (read qatal or qattal) their children, by burying them alive, in folly, out of ignorance, without knowledge, and have forbidden what God has provided them, of what has been mentioned, in calumny against God. Verily they have gone astray and are not guided.",
  "And He it is Who produces, creates, gardens, orchards, trellised, extending along the ground, as in the case of watermelons, and untrellised, rising upwards on a stem, such as palm-trees; and, He produces, palm- trees, and crops diverse in flavour, [diverse] in the shape and savour of its fruit and seed, and olives, and pomegranates, alike, in [terms of their] leaf (mutashbihan, \u0060alike\u0027, is a circumstantial qualifier) and unlike, in [terms of their] savour. Eat of the fruit thereof when it ripens, before its maturity [passes], and pay the due thereof, the alms as appropriate, on the day of its harvest (read yawma hasdahu or yawma hasdihi), that is, one tenth or half of it, and do not be prodigal, by giving it all away, so that nothing remains for [the consumption of] your dependants. Truly, God does not love the prodigal, who overstep [the bounds of] that which He has delimited for them.",
  "And, He produces, of the cattle some for burden, fit to bear loads, such as the large [mature] camels, and some for light support, not fit for these [load-bearing tasks], such as young camels or sheep (such [cattle] are called farsh because they are like \u0060bedding [farsh] spread on the ground\u0027, on account of their [physical] closeness to it); eat of that which God has provided you and do not follow the steps of Satan, his methods of forbidding [things] or deeming [them] lawful. Surely he is a manifest foe to you, one whose enmity is evident.",
  "Eight pairs, types (thamniyata azwjin substitutes for hamlatan wa-farshan, \u0060some for burdens and some for light support\u0027): two of sheep, a male and a female; and of goats (read ma\u0060az or ma\u0060z) two. Say, O Muhammad (s) to those who on one occasion deem male cattle forbidden, and on another, the females thereof, and then ascribe such [rules] to God: \u0060Is it the two males, of the sheep and goats, He has forbidden, you, or the two females, of these two [types], or that which the wombs of the two females contain, be they male or female? Inform Me with knowledge, of the details of such prohibitions, if you speak truly\u0027, in this [matter], meaning: on what basis has the prohibition been made? If it is on the basis of maleness, then all males are forbidden; if on the basis of femaleness, then all females are so [forbidden]; if on what the womb may contain, then both genders are prohibited. So, on what basis are such specifications made? (the interrogative is meant as a repudiation).",
  "And of the camels two and of the oxen two. Say: \u0060Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females? Or what the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses, present, when God charged you with this?, prohibition, such that you use it to support your claims? Nay! You speak lies in this [matter]. Then who, that is, none, does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God, in this matter, that he may lead mankind astray without any knowledge? Truly God does not guide evildoing folk\u0027.",
  "Say: \u0060I do not find, in what is revealed to me, anything forbidden to him who eats thereof except it be (read yakn or takn) carrion (maytatan; or if read maytatun, then with the form yakn, \u0060it be\u0027, preceding it) or blood poured forth, flowing, as opposed to [the case of] a liver or a spleen; or the flesh of swine -- that indeed is an abomination, forbidden, or, except it be, a wicked thing that has been hallowed to other than God, that is to say, it has been slaughtered in the name of someone else. But whoever is constrained, to do any of what has been mentioned, and he consumes it, neither coveting nor transgressing, then surely your Lord is Forgiving, to him for what he has consumed, Merciful\u0027, towards him. To these [prohibited things] the Sunna adds all beasts of prey with canine teeth and birds [of prey] with talons.",
  "And to those of Jewry, that is, the Jews, We forbade every beast with hoof, that is, [every animal] which does not have divided toes, such as camels and ostriches; and of oxen and sheep We forbade them the fat of them, the thin fat lining the stomach and the fat of the kidneys, save what their backs carry, that is, what [fat] is attached to it, or, what is carried by, their entrails, their intestines (hawy is the plural of hwiy\u0027 or hwiya), or what is mingled with bone, thereof, which is the fat of the rump: these were lawful for them; that, prohibition, We requited them, with, for their insolence, on account of their wrongdoing, as already mentioned in srat al-Nis\u0027 [Q. 4:160]; verily We are truthful, in [recounting] Our tidings and Our appointed times.",
  "So, if they deny you, with regard to what you have brought, then say, to them: \u0060Your Lord has all-embracing mercy, for He does not hasten [to bring about] your punishment -- herein is a gentle summoning of them to the faith; and His might, His chastisement, when it comes, will never be driven back from the sinning folk\u0027.",
  "The idolaters will say, \u0060Had God willed, we would not have been idolaters, neither, we [nor], our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything\u0027, in other words, our idolatry and our forbidding [of things] are by His will, and so He must be satisfied with it. God, exalted be He, says: So, in the same way that these have lied, those who were before them gave the lie, to their prophets, until they tasted Our might, Our chastisement. Say: \u0060Have you any knowledge, that God is satisfied with this, such that you can adduce for us?, that is, you have no such knowledge. You follow only supposition, in this [matter], merely guessing\u0027, telling lies therein.",
  "Say, if you have no definitive argument, then: \u0060To God belongs the conclusive argument, the perfect [one], for had He willed, to guide you, He could have guided all of you\u0027.",
  "Say: \u0060Come, bring forth, your witnesses, those who can testify that God has forbidden this\u0027, which you have forbidden. Then if they testify, do not bear witness with them; and do not follow the whims of those who deny Our signs, those who do not believe in the Hereafter and ascribe equals to their Lord, associating others [with Him].",
  "Say: \u0060Come, I will recite that which your Lord has made a sacred duty for you: that (all: [consisting of an- l] an being explicative) you associate nothing with Him, that you be dutiful to parents, and that you do not slay your children, by burying them alive, because of poverty, destitution, that you may fear -- We will provide for you and them -- and that you do not draw near any acts of lewdness, grave sins, such as fornication, whether it be manifest or concealed, that is, [acts committed] overtly or in secret, and that you do not slay the life which God has made sacred, except rightfully, as in the case of retaliation, or [as] the prescribed punishment for apostasy, and the stoning of an adulterer. This, which is mentioned, is what He has charged you with, that perhaps you will understand, reflect.",
  "And that you do not approach the property of the orphan save with that, approach, which is fairer, namely, the one wherein lie his best interests, until he is of age, when he is sexually mature. And give full measure and full weight, in justice, fairly, desisting from any fraud. We do not charge any soul beyond its capacity, what it can bear in such [matters], so that if one makes a mistake in a measure or weight, and God knows that his intention had been well-meaning, then he suffers no blame, as is stated in one hadth. And if you speak, [to pass] a judgement or otherwise, then be just, by being truthful, even if he, the person receiving the statement or the one being accused in it, should be a kinsman.

  "Surely your Lord is God, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, of the days of this world, that is to say, in the equivalent thereof, since there was no sun then. Had He willed He could have created them in an instant; but the reason for His not having done so is that He wanted to teach His creatures to be circumspect; then presided upon the Throne, a presiding befitting of Him (al-\u0060arsh, \u0060throne\u0027, in the [classical] language is the elevated seat on which a king sits). He cloaks (read yughsh or yughashsh) the night with the day, that is, He covers each one with the other: each following the other in swift pursuit -- and the sun and the moon and the stars (if all of these are read in the accusative, then they constitute a supplement to al-samwt, \u0060the heavens\u0027, and if in the nominative, then they constitute the subject of the sentence, the predicate of which follows) have been made subservient, [have been] subdued, by His command, by His power. Verily, His is, all, creation and the command, in its entirety. Blessed, Magnified, be God, the Lord, the Master, of the Worlds!",
  "Call upon your Lord humbly (tadarru\u0060an is a circumstantial qualifier), in subservience, and quietly, in secret. Truly, He loves not the aggressors, who are braggarts and loud-mouthed in [their] supplications.",
  "And work not corruption in the land, through idolatry and acts of disobedience, after it has been set right, as a result of the sending forth of messengers [to it], and call upon Him in fear, of His punishment, and in hope, of His mercy -- surely the mercy of God is near to the virtuous, the obedient (qarb, \u0060near\u0027, as the predicate of [the feminine noun] rahma, \u0060mercy\u0027, is in the masculine because it [rahma] is annexed to Allh, \u0060God\u0027).",
  "He it is Who sends the winds, unfolding with His mercy, that is, dispersing before the rains (a variant reading [for nushuran, \u0060unfolding\u0027] has nushran; another reading has nashran as the verbal noun; and a third variant has bushran, meaning mubashshiran, \u0060[with which] He is bearing good tidings [of His mercy]\u0027; the singular of the first reading is nashr, similar [in pattern] to rasl, \u0060messenger\u0027; the singular of the last is bashr) until, when they, the winds, bear heavy clouds, [clouds heavy] with rain, We lead it, that is, [We lead] the clouds (herein is a shift from the third [to the first] person), to a dead land, one devoid of any vegetation, in other words, [We lead it there] in order to revive it, and then We send down thereon, on that land, and bring forth thereby, by this water, fruits of every kind. Like that, bringing forth, We shall bring forth the dead, from their graves, through revivification, so that you might remember, and believe.",
  "As for the good land, the one of rich soil, its vegetation comes forth, wholesomely, by permission of its Lord -- this is a similitude of the believer who, when he hears an admonition, he [heeds it and] benefits from it. While as for the, one whose soil is, bad -- the vegetation in, it comes forth only miserably, laboriously and with difficulty -- this is the similitude of the disbeliever. Even, as We have made clear what has been mentioned, so We dispense, We make clear, the signs for a people who are thankful, to God and so believe.",
  "Verily (laqad is the response to an oath that has been omitted) We sent Noah to his people, and he said, \u0060O my people, worship God! You have no god other than Him (read ghayrihi as an adjective of ilh, \u0060god\u0027, or ghayruhu as a substitution in its place [sc. instead of min ilhin, \u0060any god\u0027). Truly, I fear for you, if you worship other than Him, the chastisement of an Awful Day\u0027, that is, the Day of Resurrection.",
  "The council, of the respected elders, of his people, said: \u0060Truly We see you in manifest error\u0027.",
  "He said, \u0060My people, there is no error in me (dalla is more general than al-dall, \u0060misguidance\u0027, and so to deny it is more effective than to deny the latter), but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds.",
  "I convey to you (read ublighkum or uballighukum) the Messages of my Lord, and I am advising you, I desire good [for you], for I know from God what you know not.",
  "Do you then, deny, marvel that a reminder, an admonition, from your Lord should come to you through, the tongue of, a man from among you, that he may warn you, of chastisement if you do not believe, and that you may fear, God, and that you might be shown mercy\u0027, by it?",
  "But they denied him, and so We delivered him and those with him, from drowning, in the Ark, [in] the ship, and We drowned those who denied Our signs, by means of the Flood. Truly they were a people blind, to the truth.",
  "And, We sent, to, the earlier, \u0060d their brother Hd. He said, \u0060O my people, worship God, affirm His Oneness! You have no god other than Him. Will you not fear?\u0027, will you [not] fear Him, and so believe?",
  "The council, those of his people who disbelieved, said: \u0060We truly see you in folly, ignorance, and we truly deem you of the liars\u0027, in your Message.",
  "He said, \u0060O my people, there is no folly in me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds.",
  "I convey to you the Messages of my Lord, and I am your truthful adviser, trustworthy in the Message [I convey].",
  "Or do you marvel that a reminder from your Lord should come to you through, the tongue of, a man from among you, that he may warn you? And remember when He made you vicegerents, on earth, after the people of Noah, and increased your stature in extension, in strength and in height -- (the tallest of them measured 100 feet, the shortest, 60). Remember then God\u0027s bounties, His graces, so that you might prosper\u0027, triumph.",
  "They said, \u0060Have you come to us that we should worship God alone, and forsake, abandon, what our fathers worshipped? Then bring upon us what you promised us, of chastisement, if you are of the truthful\u0027, in what you say.",
  "He said, \u0060Already, terror, chastisement, and wrath from your Lord have fallen, [they] must be [sent down], on you. Do you dispute with me concerning names which you have named, that is, with which you, you and your fathers, have named idols that you worship, for which, that is, for the worship of which, God has not revealed any warrant?, any definitive argument or proof? Then await, the chastisement. Truly I shall be with you waiting\u0027, for that, on account of your denial of me: thus a blighting wind was unleashed against them [cf. Q. 51:4].",
  "So We delivered him, namely, Hd, and those with him, from among the believers, by a mercy from Us, and We cut the root of those, people, who denied Our signs, that is, We extirpated them, and were not believers (wa-m kn mu\u0027minna is a supplement to kadhdhab, \u0060[those who] denied\u0027).",
  "And, We sent, to Thamud (Thamda, read without declining [the noun], as denoting the tribe [of Thamud] itself) their brother Salih. He said, \u0060O my people, worship God! You have no god other than Him. Truly there has come to you a clear proof, an illustration, from your Lord, of my truthfulness, this is the she-camel of God, a sign for you (lakum yatan is a circumstantial qualifier operated by the import of the demonstrative noun [hdhihi, \u0060this\u0027]), they had asked him to make it come out of a [specific] rock which they had designated. So leave her to feed throughout God\u0027s earth, and do not touch her with harm, either by hamstringing or beating her, lest you be seized by a painful chastisement.",
  "And remember how He made you vicegerents, on earth, after \u0060d, and gave you habitations in the land, making castles in its plains, in which you lodge during summer, and hewing its mountains into houses, in which you lodge during winter (buytan, \u0060houses\u0027, is in the accusative because of the implied circumstantial qualifier). So remember God\u0027s bounties and do not be degenerate in the earth, seeking corruption\u0027.",
  "Said the council of those of his people who waxed proud, [who] disdained belief in him, to those who were oppressed, to such of them as believed, that is, from among his people (li-man mana minhum, \u0060to such of them as believed\u0027, is a substitution for the preceding clause [li\u0027lladhna istud\u0060if, \u0060to those who were oppressed\u0027], repeating the preposition [li-, \u0060to\u0027]): \u0060Are you aware that Slih has been sent, to you, from his Lord?\u0027 They said, \u0060Yes! Truly we believe in the Message with which he has been sent.\u0027",
  "Said the ones who were proud, \u0060Truly we are disbelievers of that which you believe!\u0027",
  "The she-camel was given the water one day and then, another; but they soon tired of this: So they hamstrung the she-camel -- Qudr hamstrung her by their command, killing her with a sword -- and flouted the commandment of their Lord, and said, \u0060O Slih, bring upon us that which you promised us, in the way of chastisement for [our] killing it, if you are indeed a messenger\u0027.",
  "So the Trembling, a violent earthquake and a cry from the heaven, seized them, and they lay lifeless prostrate in their habitations, keeled over their knees, dead.",
  "So he turned his back on them, Slih left [them], and said, \u0060O my people, I have conveyed to you the Message of my Lord and gave you sincere advice, but you do not love sincere advisers\u0027.",
  "And, mention, Lot (Ltan is substituted by [the following, idh qla]) when he said to his people, \u0060Do you commit abomination, that is, [penetrating] the rears of men, such as no one in all the worlds ever committed before you, humans or jinn?",
  "Do you (read a-innakum, pronouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the second one, but in both cases inserting an alif between the two; a variant reading has innakum, \u0060indeed you ... \u0027) come lustfully to men instead of women? Nay, you are a wanton folk\u0027, transgressing [the bounds], [going] from what is lawful to what is unlawful.",
  "And the response of his people was only that they said, \u0060Expel them, that is, Lt and his followers, from your city. Surely they are folk who would be pure!\u0027, from [the abomination of penetrating] the rears of men.",
  "So We delivered him and his family, except his wife: she was of those who stayed behind, who remained in the chastisement.",
  "And We rained upon them a rain, the stones of baked clay (hijrat al-sijjl), and it destroyed them. So behold what was the end of the sinners!",
  "And, We sent, to Midian their brother Shu\u0060ayb. He said, \u0060O my people, worship God! You have no god other than Him. Verily there has come to you a clear proof, a miracle, from your Lord, to [prove] my truthfulness. So give full measure and weight and do not defraud, diminish [the value of], people\u0027s goods, and do not work corruption in the earth, by way of unbelief and acts of disobedience, after it has been set right, through the sending of messengers [thereto]. That, mentioned, is better for you, if you are believers, [if you are] seekers of faith, so hasten to it.",
  "And do not sit in every path, [every] route, threatening, terrifying people by seizing their garments, or by charging them excise [tax], and barring, driving away, from God\u0027s way, [from] His religion, those who believe in Him -- when you threaten to kill them -- and desiring that it, seeking that the path, be crooked. And remember when you were but few, and then He multiplied you. And behold what was the end of the agents of corruption, before you, for denying their messengers, that is, [behold] how destruction was the conclusion of their affair.",
  "And if there is a party of you who believe in that with which I have been sent, and a party who do not believe, in it, then be patient, wait, until God judges between us, and you, by delivering the affirmer [of this truth] and destroying the denier [of it]. He is the best of judges\u0027, the fairest of them.",
  "Said the council of those of his people who were disdainful, of believing: \u0060Surely we will expel you, O Shu\u0060ayb, and those who believe with you, from our city, unless you return to our creed\u0027, our religion (the plural person predominates over the singular in their address [to Shu\u0060ayb] because Shu\u0060ayb was never part of their religious community; and so in the same [plural] way he responded:) He said, \u0060What, should we return to it, even though we are averse, to it? (the interrogative is meant as a disavowal).",
  "We would be forging a lie against God if we were to return to your creed, after God has delivered us from it. It is not, right, for us to return to it, unless God our Lord wills, that [it be so] and forsakes us. Our Lord embraces all things through His knowledge, that is to say, His knowledge embraces all things, including my situation and yours. In God we have put our trust. Our Lord, decide, adjudicate, between us and our people, for You are the best of deciders\u0027, adjudicators.",
  "Said the council of those of his people who disbelieved, that is, some said to others: \u0060Verily if (la-in: the lm is for oaths) you follow Shu\u0060ayb, you shall indeed be losers\u0027.",
  "So the Trembling, the violent earthquake, seized them, and they lay lifeless prostrate in their habitations, keeled over their knees, dead.",
  "Those who denied Shu\u0060ayb (alladhna kadhdhab Shu\u0060ayban, this constitutes the subject [of the sentence], the predicate of which is [introduced by the following ka-an, \u0060as if\u0027]), it is as if (ka-an, has been softened, its subject omitted, in other words [understand it as] ka-annahum) they had never dwelt, [never] had residence, there, in those dwelling-places of theirs; those who denied Shu\u0060ayb, they were the losers (the emphasis effected by the repetition of the relative clause [alladhna kadhdhab Shu\u0060ayban, \u0060those who denied Shu\u0060ayb\u0027] and what follows it is intended as a refutation of what they had said previously [sc. \u0060if you follow Shu\u0060ayb, you shall indeed be losers\u0027]).",
  "So he turned back on them, and said, \u0060O my people, I have conveyed to you the Messages of my Lord and advised you sincerely, but you believe not: so why should I grieve for a disbelieving people?\u0027 (the interrogative is meant [rhetorically] as a negation).",
  "And We did not send a prophet to any city but that, when they denied him, We seized, We punished, its people with misery, abject poverty, and hardship, illness, so that they might be humble, [so that they might be] self-effaced, and so believe.",
  "Then We gave them in place of evil, the chastisement, good, wealth and health, until they multiplied, and said, out of ingratitude towards this grace: \u0060Hardship and happiness befell our fathers before\u0027, just as it has befallen us, and this is nothing but the habit of time, and not the consequence of God, so remain firm in what you follow. God, exalted be He, says: So We seized them, with the chastisement, suddenly, while they perceived not, beforehand the time of its coming.",
  "Yet had the people of the towns, the deniers, believed, in God and the messengers [sent] to them, and been fearful, of unbelief and acts of disobedience, We would have indeed opened upon them (read la-fatahn or la-fattahn) blessings from the heaven, by way of rain, and earth, by way of vegetation; but they denied, the messengers, and so We seized them, We punished them, on account of what they used to earn.",
  "Do the people of the towns, the deniers, feel secure from the coming of Our might, Our chastisement, upon them at night while they are sleeping?, unaware of it?",
  "Or, do the people of the towns feel secure from the coming of Our might upon them in the daytime while they are playing?",
  "And so do they feel secure from God\u0027s plotting?, that is, His drawing them on by degrees, through graces, and then seizing them suddenly. None feels secure from God\u0027s plotting but the people who are losers.",
  "Has it not been shown, [has it not] become clear, to those who inherit the earth, as a [place of] habitation, after, the destruction of, those who inhabited it that, (an is the softened form and constitutes the subject [of the verb], its noun having been omitted, in other words [understand it as] annahu), if We will, We could smite them, with chastisement, for their sins?, as We smote those before them? (the hamza in the four instances are meant to indicate rebuke, and the [particles] fa, \u0060so\u0027, and wa, \u0060and\u0027, which have been inserted in two instances [each], are meant to indicate a supplement; a variant reading [for a-wa-amina] has aw amina, \u0060or do [they] feel secure\u0027, in the [second] instance, as a supplement). And, We, seal up their hearts so that they do not hear, the admonition, in a way so as to reflect.",
  "Those towns, which have been mentioned, We relate to you, O Muhammad (s), some of their tidings, [some of] the stories of their peoples. Verily their messengers brought them clear proofs, manifest miracles, but they would not believe, when these [signs]came to them, in what they had denied, disbelieved in, before, before these [signs] came to them; nay, they persisted in disbelief. Thus does God seal up the hearts of the disbelievers.",
  "And We did not find in most of them, that is, people, any covenant, that is, any loyalty to a covenant from the day the pledge was made. Nay (wa-in: in is softened) We found that most of them were indeed wicked.",
  "Then We sent, after them, that is, [after] the messengers mentioned, Moses with Our, nine, signs to Pharaoh and his council, his folk, but they mistreated, they disbelieved in, them. So behold what was the end of those who work corruption, by way of disbelief, when they were destroyed.",
  "And Moses said, \u0060O Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds, to you, but he denied him. So he [Moses] said:",
  "I am, one for whom it is right, [for whom] it is appropriate, to say nothing but the truth about God (a variant reading [for \u0060al] has \u0060alayya, \u0060for me\u0027, in which case, haqqun, \u0060it is right\u0027, is the subject [of the sentence], its predicate being an, \u0060that\u0027, and what follows it [sc. \u0060I say nothing but the truth about God\u0027]). Truly I have come to you with a clear proof from your Lord. So send forth with me, to Syria, the Children of Israel\u0027: he [Pharaoh] had enslaved them.",
  "Said he, Pharaoh, to him: \u0060If you have come with a sign, as you claim, then produce it, if you are of those who speak the truth\u0027, in this.",
  "Then he cast down his staff and lo! it was a serpent, manifest [for all to see], an enormous snake.",
  "And he drew forth his hand, he took it out from his bosom, and lo! it was white, radiant, for the beholders, and not its usual skin colour.",
  "The council of Pharaoh\u0027s folk said, \u0060Surely this man is a cunning sorcerer, outstanding in the art of magic, in [srat] al-Shu\u0060ar\u0027 [Q. 26:34], these are actually Pharaoh\u0027s words, and so it is as if they said it in consultation with him,",
  "who would expel you from your land. So what do you command?\u0027",
  "They said, \u0060Put him and his brother off a while, postpone [any decision regarding] their affair, and send into the towns summoners, gatherers,",
  "to bring you every cunning sorcerer\u0027 (shir: a variant reading has sahhr) to outdo Moses in the art of magic. And so they summoned [them].",
  "And the sorcerers came to Pharaoh, saying, \u0060Surely (a-inna: read pronouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the second one, but inserting an alif between the two in both cases) there will be a wage for us if we are the victors?\u0027",
  "He said, \u0060Yes, and indeed you shall be of those brought near\u0027.",
  "They said, \u0060O Moses, either you cast, your staff, or we shall be the casters!\u0027, of what we have.",
  "He said, \u0060Cast!\u0027, this is a command permitting them to cast first, as a means to manifesting the truth. And when they cast, their ropes and staffs, they put a spell upon the people\u0027s eyes, misleading them from perceiving the real state of these [ropes and staffs], and overawed them, scared them, by making them appear to be slithering snakes, and produced a mighty sorcery.",
  "And We revealed to Moses [saying]: \u0060Cast your staff.\u0027 And lo! it swallowed up (read talaqqafu, with one of the original t\u0027 letters [of tatalaqqafu] omitted) the illusion they were creating, that which they were transforming by delusion.",
  "Thus did the truth come to pass, [thus was it] confirmed and made manifest; and that which they were doing, in the way of sorcery, was proved false.",
  "Thus were they, that is, Pharaoh and his folk, there defeated, becoming humiliated -- they ended up abased.",
  "And the sorcerers fell down in prostration.",
  "They said, \u0060We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,",
  "the Lord of Moses and Aaron\u0027, for they realised that what they had witnessed of the staff could not be done through sorcery.",
  "Pharaoh said, \u0060Have you believed (a-mantum, read pronouncing both hamzas, and replacing the second one with an alif) in him, in Moses, before I gave you leave? Surely this, that you have done, is a plot you have plotted in the city that you may expel its people from it. But you shall come to know, what I will do to you!",
  "I shall assuredly have your hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, that is, the right hand and the left foot of every one, then I shall have every one of you crucified\u0027.",
  "They said, \u0060Surely to our Lord, after our death, however it come about, we shall be restored, we shall return, in the Hereafter.",
  "You are vindictive, spiteful, towards us only because we have believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us. Our Lord, pour out onto us patience (and constancy), when that with which he has threatened us comes to pass, lest we revert to unbelief; and take us to You as men who have submitted\u0027.",
  "Then the council of Pharaoh\u0027s folk said, to him [to Pharaoh]: \u0060Will you leave Moses and his people to work corruption in the land, by calling to disobedience against you, and flout you and your gods?\u0027 -- he had fashioned small idols for them to worship, and had said to them, \u0060I am your lord and their lord\u0027, which is why he says, I am your lord the highest [Q. 79:24]. He said, \u0060We shall slaughter (read nuqattilu or naqtulu) their, new-born, sons and spare their women, keeping them alive [for us], as we did with them before. For surely we have [irresistible] power over them!\u0027, and they did this to them, and so the Children of Israel grieved.",
  "Moses said to his people, \u0060Seek help in God and be patient, their persecution. Surely the earth is God\u0027s and He bequeaths it, He gives it, to whom He will from among His servants. The, praiseworthy, sequel belongs to those who are wary, of God\u0027.",
  "They said, \u0060We suffered harm before you came to us, and since you have come to us.\u0027 He said, \u0060Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land, that He may observe how you shall act\u0027, in it.",
  "And verily We seized Pharaoh\u0027s folk with the years, of drought, and dearth of fruits, so that they might remember, [that they might] heed the admonition, and become believers.",
  "But whenever a good thing, [such as] fertility and abundance, befell them, they said, \u0060This belongs to us\u0027, that is, we deserve it, and they did not give thanks for it; and whenever an evil thing, [such as] drought or hardship, smote them, they would augur ill of Moses and those, believers, with him. Surely their ill augury is with God, Who brings it upon them, but most of them do not know, that whatever befalls them is from Him.",
  "And they said, to Moses, \u0060Whatever sign you bring us, to cast a spell upon us therewith, we will not believe in you\u0027, and so he [Moses] invoked God against them.",
  "So We unleashed upon them the flood, of water, which penetrated their houses and which for seven days would come up to people\u0027s necks as they sat; and the locusts, which consumed their crops and fruits, likewise [engulfing them for seven days]; and the lice (al-qummal is like al-ss, \u0060woodworm\u0027, or al-qurd, \u0060ticks\u0027), which would follow [and consume] what the locusts left behind; and the frogs, such that they infested their houses and food supplies; and the blood, [flowing] in their water, distinct, clear, signs: but they were too scornful, to believe in them, and were a sinful folk.",
  "And when the terror, the chastisement, fell upon them, they said, \u0060O Moses, pray to your Lord for our sake by the covenant which He has made with you, to remove the chastisement from us if we believe. Indeed if (la-in: the lm is for oaths) you remove from us the terror, verily we will believe in you and let the Children of Israel go with you\u0027.",
  "But when We removed, through the supplication of Moses, the terror from them to a term which they should reach, lo! they were already reneging, breaking their covenant and persisting in their disbelief.",
  "So We exacted retribution from them and therefore We drowned them in the sea (al-yamm denotes salty waters) for, the reason, that they denied Our signs and were heedless of them, not reflecting upon them.",
  "And We bequeathed upon the people who were oppressed, through bondage, namely, the Children of Israel, the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We had blessed, with water and trees (allat brakn fh, \u0060which We had blessed\u0027, is an adjectival qualification of al-ard, \u0060the land\u0027), and this was Syria, and the fair word of your Lord was fulfilled, which was His saying, exalted be He: Yet We desired to be gracious to those who were oppressed in the land ... to the end [of the verse, Q. 28:5], for the Children of Israel because they endured patiently, persecution at the hands of their enemy; and We destroyed utterly what Pharaoh and his folk had been creating, by way of architecture, and what they had been erecting (read ya\u0060rishn or ya\u0060rushn), [what they had been] raising of edifices.",
  "And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and they came upon, they passed by, a people cleaving in devotion (read ya\u0060kufn or ya\u0060kifn) to idols they had, constantly worshipping them. They said, \u0060O Moses, make for us a god, an idol for us to worship, just as they have gods.\u0027 He said, \u0060Truly you are an ignorant folk, for repaying God\u0027s grace to you with what you have said.",
  "Truly as for these, their way will be destroyed and what they have been doing is in vain\u0027.",
  "He said, \u0060Shall I seek other than God as a god for you, to worship (abghkum, \u0060[shall] I seek for you\u0027, is originally abgh lakum), when He has favoured you above all the worlds?\u0027, of your time, in the ways He has mentioned in His sayings?",
  "And, remember, when We delivered you (anjaynkum: a variant reading has anjkum, \u0060He delivered you\u0027) from Pharaoh\u0027s folk who were inflicting upon you, [who were] burdening you and making you taste, terrible chastisement, the worst kind [of chastisement], namely, slaying your sons and sparing, retaining, your women; and therein, [in that] deliverance or chastisement, was a tremendous trial, [either] a grace or a tribulation, from your Lord, so will you not heed the admonition and desist from what you are saying?",
  "And We appointed (read wa-w\u0060adn or wa-wa\u0060adn) for Moses thirty nights, at the end of which We would speak to him, after he has fasted [during that period]; that was the month of Dh\u0027l-Qa\u0060da. He completed the fast. But when it came to an end, he disliked the [bad] odour of his mouth and so cleaned his teeth. God then commanded him [to fast for] another ten nights so that He may speak to him despite the odour in his mouth: as God says, and completed them with ten, nights of Dh\u0027l-Hijja. Thus was the time appointed by his Lord concluded, the time at which God had promised him to speak to him, as forty (arba\u0060na is a circumstantial qualifier) nights (laylatan is for specification); and Moses said to his brother Aaron, when he was departing to the Mount for the communion [with his Lord]: \u0060Succeed me, be my deputy, over my people, and be righteous, [among them] with regard to their affair, and do not follow the way of the agents of corruption\u0027, by consenting with them to acts of disobedience.",
  "And when Moses came at Our appointed time, that is, the time at which We had promised to speak to him, and his Lord spoke with him, without any intermediary, with speech which he heard from all directions, he said, \u0060My Lord! Show me, Yourself, that I may behold You!\u0027 Said He, \u0060You shall not see Me, that is to say, you do not have the power to see me, the use of this expression [lan tarn, \u0060you shall not see Me\u0027] instead of lan ur, \u0060I shall not be seen\u0027, implies that it is possible to see God, exalted be He; but behold the mountain, which is stronger than you are, and if it remains, stays fixed, in its place, then you shall see Me\u0027, that is, [then] you shall remain fixed [able] to see Me, otherwise, you will not have the capacity [for it]. And when his Lord revealed Himself, that is, [when] He manifested of His Light the equivalent of half a nail of a little finger, as stated in one hadth verified by al-Hkim, to the mountain He levelled it to the ground (read dakkan or dakk\u0027a, meaning madkkan) and Moses fell down senseless, having lost consciousness at the awesomeness of what he had seen. And when he recovered his senses he said, \u0060Glory be to You!, in Your transcendence. I repent to You, for having asked You what I was not commanded [to ask], and I am the first of the believers\u0027, of my time.",
  "He, God, said, to him: \u0060O Moses, I have elected you, chosen you, from among mankind, the people of your time, for My Messages (read plural, bi-rislt, or singular, bi-rislat, \u0060for My Message\u0027) and My Speech, that is, [for] My having spoken to you. So take what I have given you, of bounty, and be of the thankful\u0027, of My favours.",
  "And We inscribed for him in the Tablets, that is, the Tablets of the Torah -- these were made from the Lote- tree of Paradise, or of chrysolite or emerald, and they were either seven or ten -- about all things, one needs in religion, as an admonition and a detailing, an explanation, of all things (li-kulli shay\u0027in substitutes for the previous genitive construction [min kulli shay\u0027, \u0060about all things\u0027]). \u0060Take it then (there is an implicit quln, \u0060We said\u0027, before this [fa-kudhh, \u0060take it then\u0027]) firmly, seriously and earnestly, and enjoin your people to adhere to the fairest [precepts] in it. I shall show you the abode of the wicked, [of] Pharaoh and his followers, and that is Egypt, that you may take an example from them.",
  "I shall turn away from My signs, the proofs of My power, in the way of creations and otherwise, those who behave arrogantly in the earth without right, by humiliating them so that they do not magnify themselves; and if they see every sign do not believe in it, and if they see the way, the path, of rectitude, the guidance that has come from God, do not adopt it as a way, to follow, and if they see the way of error, misguidance, adopt it as a way. That, turning [of them] away, is because they have denied Our signs and were heedless of them. A similar statement has been made above.",
  "Those who deny Our signs and the encounter in the Hereafter, the Resurrection and so on. their works, the good deeds they performed in the world, such as the maintenance of kinship ties or voluntary almsgivings, have failed, are invalid, and will not be rewarded, since they are not binding [in this case]. Shall they, they shall not, be requited anything but, the requital [for], what they used to do?\u0027, in the way of denial and acts of disobedience?",
  "And the people of Moses, after him, that is, after he had departed for the communion [with God], made of their ornaments, which they had borrowed from Pharaoh\u0027s folk on the pretext of a wedding celebration, and which remained in their possession, a calf, which the Samaritan had fashioned for them therefrom; a [mere] living body (jasadan is a substitution [for \u0060ijlan, \u0060a calf\u0027]), of flesh and blood, which lowed, that is, [which] made audible sounds [like a cow]: it [the calf] was transformed in this way when the dust, which he [the Samaritan] had collected from [where] the hoof of Gabriel\u0027s steed [had trodden], was placed in its mouth, for it has the effect of [giving] life to that in which it is placed (the second direct object of the verb ittakhadha, \u0060[they] made\u0027, has been omitted, but it would be ilhan, \u0060[as] a god\u0027). Did they not see that it spoke not to them, nor guided them to any way?, so how can it be taken as a god? Yet they took it as such, a god, and were evildoers, for taking it so.",
  "And when they became at a loss, that is, [when] they became remorseful for having worshipped it, and saw, [and] realised, that they had gone astray, thereby, and this was after Moses\u0027s return [from the communion], they said, \u0060Unless our Lord is merciful to us and forgives us (read both [verbs] either in the third person singular or in the second person singular), verily we shall be among the losers\u0027.",
  "And when Moses returned to his people, angry, because of them, and bitterly grieved, he said, to them: \u0060Evil is that, that is, evil is the [manner of] succession, which you have followed in my place, after I had gone, this idolatry of yours. Would you hasten on the judgement of your Lord?\u0027 And he cast down the Tablets, the Tablets of the Torah, angry for the sake of his Lord, and they were broken into pieces, and he seized his brother by the head, that is, by the hair, with his right hand, and [seized him] by the beard, with his left hand, dragging him toward him, in anger. He said, \u0060O, son of my mother! (read either ibna ummi or ibna umma, by which he meant [the standard form of saying \u0060my mother\u0027] umm: the mention of her is more affectionate [in appealing] to his heart), Truly the people judged me weak and they were close to killing me. Do not make my enemies gloat over my misfortune, to rejoice thereat, by your humiliating me, and do not count me among the folk who have done evil\u0027, by worshipping the calf, in [your] reproach [of them].",
  "He said, \u0060My Lord, forgive me, what I have done to my brother, and my brother, he includes him in the supplication in order to reconcile him and to fend off any gloating over his misfortune, and admit us into Your mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of the merciful\u0027.",
  "God, exalted be He, says, \u0060Surely those who chose the calf, as a god. wrath, chastisement, and abasement shall come upon them from their Lord in the life of this world: and so they were punished [for this deed] by the command to slay themselves, and abasement was stamped upon them until the Day of Resurrection. Even, as We have requited them, so We requite those who invent lies, against God by way of idolatry and otherwise.",
  "But those who commit evil deeds and repent, desist from them, thereafter and believe, in God -- indeed your Lord thereafter, that is, after repentance, is truly Forgiving, Merciful\u0027, towards them.",
  "And when Moses\u0027s anger abated, subsided, he took the Tablets, which he had cast down, and in their copy, that is, [in] what was inscribed upon them -- in other words, it was written that: there was guidance, from error, and mercy for all those who hold their Lord in awe, [who] have fear [of Him] (the lm [in li-rabbihim, \u0060their Lord\u0027] has been inserted into the direct object because it [the direct object] has preceded [the verb]).",
  "And Moses chose of his people seventy men, from among those who had not worshipped the calf, by God\u0027s command, for Our appointed time, that is, for the time at which We promised him that they should come and apologise for their comrades\u0027 worship of the calf. He [Moses] then departed with them; but when the Trembling, a violent earthquake, seized them, Ibn \u0060Abbs said, \u0060[That earthquake was] because they did not separate themselves from their people when the latter took to worshipping the calf\u0027; he [Ibn \u0060Abbs] added, \u0060These [people] were not the same ones who asked to see God and were struck by the thunderbolt [cf. Q. 2:55]\u0027, he, Moses, said, \u0060My Lord, had You willed You would have destroyed them long before, that is, before my departure with them, so that the Children of Israel might see this and not make [false] accusations against me, and me [with them]. Will You destroy us for what the foolish ones among us have done? (this interrogative is meant as a plea for compassion, in other words, \u0060Do not punish us for the sins of others\u0027). It, that is, the trial which the ignorant ones underwent, is but Your trial, Your test, whereby You send astray whom You will, to lead stray, and guide whom You will, to guide. You are our Protector, looking after our affairs, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the Best of all who show forgiveness.",
  "And prescribe for us, grant [us], in this world good and in the Hereafter, good. We have turned, repented, to You\u0027. He, God, says: \u0060My chastisement -- I smite with it whom I will, to chastise, and My mercy embraces, subsumes, all things, in this world, and so I shall prescribe it, in the Hereafter, for those who are God- fearing and pay the alms, and those who believe in Our signs;",
  "those who follow the Messenger, the uninstructed Prophet, Muhammad (s) whom they will find inscribed in their Torah and Gospel, in name and description, enjoining them to decency and forbidding them indecency, making lawful for them the good things, which were forbidden [to them] by their Law, and making unlawful for them the vile things, such as carrion and the like, and relieving them of their burden, their onus, and the shackles, the hardships, that they used to bear, such as [the requirement] to kill oneself as a repentance and the severing of that part that had come into contact with any impurity. Then those who believe in him, from among them, and honour, revere, him, and help him, and follow the light that has been revealed with him, namely, the Qur\u0027n, they are the ones who will prosper\u0027.",
  "Say, addressing the Prophet (s) here: \u0060O mankind, I am the Messenger of God to you all, [the Messenger] of Him to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth. There is no god but Him. He gives life and makes to die. Believe, then, in God and His Messenger, the uninstructed Prophet, who believes in God and His words, the Qur\u0027n, and follow him, so that you might be guided, led aright.",
  "And among the people of Moses there is a community, a group, who guide, people, by the truth and act justly according to it, when passing judgements.",
  "And We divided them, We separated the Children of Israel, into twelve (ithnatay \u0060asharata is a circumstantial qualifier) tribes (asbtan substitutes for this [previous circumstantial qualifier]) communities (umaman substitutes for the preceding [asbtan, \u0060tribes\u0027). And We revealed to Moses, when his people asked him for water, in the wilderness, [saying]: \u0060Strike the rock with your staff\u0027, and he struck it, and there gushed forth, burst forth, from it twelve fountains, equal to the number of tribes, each people, [each] tribe among them, now knew their drinking-place. And We made the cloud overshadow them, in the wilderness, from the heat of the sun, and We sent down to them manna and quails -- which are [respectively, a type of citrus] turunjabn, and the quail and We said to them: \u0060Eat of the good things We have provided for you.\u0027 And they did not wrong Us, but they wronged themselves.",
  "And, mention, when it was said to them, \u0060Dwell in this city, the Holy House [of Jerusalem], and eat therein wherever you will, and say, \u0060our concern is for [an], Exoneration,\u0027 and enter the gate, that is, the gate of the city, prostrating, a prostration that is [actually] a bow. We shall forgive (read naghfir, or the passive tughfar) you your transgressions; We shall give more to those who are virtuous, through obedience, in terms of reward.",
  "But the evildoers among them substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them, they said instead, \u0060A grain inside a hair\u0027 and entered [the gate] dragging themselves on their rears. So We sent down upon them terror, a chastisement, from the heaven for their evildoing.",
  "And question them, O Muhammad (s), in rebuke, about the city that was by the sea, bordering the Red Sea (bahr al-qulzum), and this was Eilat, [about] what befell its inhabitants, how they would transgress, violate, the Sabbath, by fishing, which they had been commanded not to do on that [day]; how (idh is an adverbial qualifier of ya\u0060dn, \u0060they [would] transgress\u0027) their fish would come to them on the day of their Sabbath floating at the surface, visible at the surface of the water; but on the day they did not observe the Sabbath, when they would not consecrate the Sabbath over the other days, they would not come to them, as a trial from God. Thus were We trying them for their wickedness. And when they went to fish, the city split into three: one third joined the fishing party, another prohibited them, while a third abstained from both fishing and prohibiting.",
  "And when (wa-idh is a supplement to the preceding idh, \u0060how\u0027) a community among them, who neither fished nor prohibited it, said, to those who prohibited it: \u0060Why do you preach [admonition] to a folk whom God is about to destroy or chastise with a severe chastisement?\u0027 They said, our admonishing [them] is, \u0060As an exculpation, by which we excuse ourselves, before your Lord, lest we are reproached for failing to prohibit [them] in any way; and so that they might be wary, of fishing\u0027.",
  "And when they forgot, when they overlooked, that whereof they had been reminded, [that for which they had been] admonished, and did not desist, We delivered those who forbade evil, and seized those who did wrong, through transgression, with a grievous, terrible, chastisement for their wickedness.",
  "And when they disdained, to desist from, that which was prohibited to them, We said to them, \u0060Be apes, despised!\u0027, abased, and they became so: this is an explication of what preceded [with regard to the details of their \u0060grievous chastisement\u0027]. Ibn \u0060Abbs said, \u0060I do not know what befell the group that abstained\u0027. \u0060Ikrima said, \u0060That group was not destroyed because they had been averse to what the others did and had said, \u0060Why do you preach (admonition) ...\u0027 Al-Hkim reported [in a hadth] that he [\u0060Ikrima] referred this opinion to Ibn \u0060Abbs, who was delighted by it.",
  "And when your Lord proclaimed, made it known, that He would send against them, that is, the Jews, to the Day of Resurrection, those who would inflict on them grievous torment, through humiliation and the exacting of the jizya-tax [from them]. Thus, God sent Solomon against them, and after him, Nebuchadnezzar, who slaughtered [some of] them and took [others among] them captive, and imposed the jizya-tax on them. They continued to pay this [tax] to the Magians up until the [time of the] sending of our Prophet (s), who [also] imposed it on them. Lo! verily your Lord is swift in requital, of those who disobey Him. And lo! verily He is Forgiving, to those who obey Him, Merciful, [in dealing] with them.",
  "And We divided them, We separated them, into communities, sects, in the earth. Some of them are righteous, and some of them, people [who], are otherwise, disbelievers and wicked individuals. And We tried them with good things, with graces, and evil things, with misfortunes, so that they might revert, from their wickedness.",
  "And there succeeded after them a generation who inherited the Scripture, the Torah, from their forefathers, choosing the transient things of this inferior [life], that is, the ephemeral aspects of this lowly thing that the world is, in the way of what is lawful and what is unlawful, and saying, \u0060It will be forgiven us\u0027, what we have done; and yet if similar transient things were to come to them, they would take them (wa-in ya\u0027tihim \u0060aradun mithluhu ya\u0027khudhhu: this sentence is a circumstantial qualifier), in other words, they hope for forgiveness whilst committing the same offence again and persisting in it: and in the Torah there is no [such] promise about forgiveness for persistence [in sin]. Has not the covenant of the Scripture (mthqu l-kitbi, the annexation functions in place of f, \u0060in\u0027 [sc. \u0060the covenant in the Scripture\u0027]) been taken (a-lam yu\u0027khadh, \u0060has [it] not been taken\u0027, is an interrogative meant as an affirmative) from them that they should not say about God anything but the truth? And they have studied (wa-daras, is a supplement to yu\u0027khadh, \u0060has it [not] been taken?\u0027), they have read, what is in it, so why do they impute lies to it [the Scripture] by ascribing to it [the idea of] forgiveness for persistence [in sin]? And the Abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are wary, of what is unlawful. Do they not understand? (ya\u0060qiln, may also be read as ta\u0060qiln, \u0060[do] you [not] understand?\u0027) that it is better and so prefer it to [the abode of] this world?",
  "And those who adhere (read yumassikn or yumsikn) to the Scripture, from among them, and have established prayer, the likes of \u0060Abd Allh b. Salm and his companions, verily We shall not let the wages of reformers go to waste (inn l nud\u0060u ajra l-muslihn: the sentence is the predicate of alladhna, \u0060those who\u0027; also there is here the replacing of the [third person] pronominalisation [alladhna, \u0060those who\u0027] with an overt noun [al-muslihna, \u0060reformers\u0027], in other words, their wages).",
  "And, mention, when We wrenched the mountain above them, We lifted it up [unearthing it] from its root, as if it were a canopy, and they thought, they were certain, that it was about to fall upon them, because of God\u0027s threat to them that it would fall upon them if they refused to accept the rulings contained in the Torah, they had [initially] refused [to accept] them because of their being burdensome, but then accepted them, and We said to them: \u0060Take firmly, seriously and earnestly, what We have given you, and remember what is in it, by acting in accordance with it, that you might be God-fearing\u0027.",
  "And, remember, when your Lord took from the Children of Adam, from their loins (min zuhrihim, is an inclusive substitution for the preceding [clause: min ban dama, \u0060from the Children of Adam\u0027], with the same preposition [min, \u0060from\u0027]) their seed, by bringing forth one from the loins of the other, [all] from the loins of Adam, offspring after offspring, in the way that they multiply, [looking] like small ants at [the valley of] Na\u0060mn on the Day of \u0060Arafa [because of their multitude]. God set up proofs of His Lordship for them and endowed them with [the faculty of] reason, and made them testify against themselves, saying, \u0060Am I not your Lord?\u0027 They said, \u0060Yea, indeed, You are our Lord, we testify\u0027, to this, and this [taking of] testimony is, lest they should say (in both instances, read third person [yaql, \u0060they say\u0027] or second person [taql, \u0060you say\u0027]) on the Day of Resurrection, \u0060Truly, of this, Oneness of God, we were unaware\u0027, not knowing it!",
  "Or lest you should say, \u0060It is merely that our fathers were idolaters before, that is, before our time, and we were descendants of theirs, and so we followed their example. Will You then destroy us, chastise us, for that which those who follow falsehood did?\u0027, from among our forefathers, by [their] establishing idolatry? The meaning is: they cannot use such arguments when they have been made to testify before their very selves to God\u0027s Oneness. To effect this reminder by the tongue of the bearer of the miracle [Muhammad (s)] equally serves [as a reminder] for every soul to remember this within itself.",
  "Thus We detail the signs, We explain them even as We have explained the covenant, that they might reflect on them, and that they might revert, from their disbelief.",
  "And recite, O Muhammad (s), to them, that is, the Jews, the tidings, the tale, of him to whom We gave Our signs, but he cast them off, emerging in his disbelief in the same way that a snake emerges from its [shed] skin, he rebelled in disbelief, this was Bal\u0060am b. B\u0060r\u0027, a scholar from among the Children of Israel, who had been given some knowledge [of the Scriptures], and who was asked [by them] to invoke God against Moses. And when he did, the invocation turned against him and his tongue fell out onto his chest, and Satan pursued him, catching up with him and so he became his comrade, and he became of the perverse.",
  "And had We willed, We would have raised him up, to the ranks of the scholars, thereby, by facilitating his way to [good] deeds; but he was disposed to, at peace [in], the earth -- that is, this world -- and inclined to it, and followed his whims, by calling [others] to them, and so We abased him. Therefore his likeness, his description, is as the likeness of a dog: if you attack it, by driving it away or curbing it, it lolls its tongue out, and if you leave it, it lolls its tongue out, and no other animal is like it in this way (both conditional sentences constitute a circumstantial qualifier, that is to say, it has its tongue lolling out despicably in all circumstances. The purpose here is to point out the similarity [between the one who follows his whims and a dog] in terms of condition and vileness, judging by the [contextualising] f\u0027 [of fa-mathaluhu, \u0060therefore his likeness\u0027], which relates what comes after it to what came before it in the way of \u0060inclining towards this world and following whims\u0027, and judging by God\u0027s saying: That, likeness, is the likeness of those people who deny Our signs. So recount the tale, to the Jews, that they might reflect, upon it and so believe.",
  "Evil as an example are the people, evil is the example of the people, who denied Our signs, and were wont to wrong themselves, through denial.",
  "He whom God guides, he is guided, and he whom He sends astray -- truly they are the losers.",
  "And We have indeed urged unto Hell many of the jinn and mankind, having hearts wherewith they do not understand, the truth, and having eyes wherewith they do not perceive, the proofs of God\u0027s power with a perception that entails reflection, and having ears wherewith they do not hear, the signs or the admonitions, in a way so as to reflect and take heed. These, they are like cattle, in their failure to understand, perceive or listen -- nay, rather they are further astray, than cattle, because [at least] they [cattle] seek what is beneficial to them and stay away from what is harmful to them: these individuals, on the other hand, are proceeding towards the Fire, out of [sheer] obstinacy. These -- they are the heedless.",
  "And to God belong the, ninety nine, Most Beautiful Names -- mentioned in hadth -- (al-husn is the feminine for al-ahsan) so invoke, name, Him by them, and leave those who blaspheme His Names (yulhidn, \u0060they blaspheme\u0027, from [fourth form] alhada or [first form] lahada, meaning \u0060those who incline away from the truth\u0027), by deriving from them names for their gods, as in the case of al-Lt, from Allh (\u0060God\u0027), al-\u0060Uzz, from al-\u0060Azz (\u0060Mighty\u0027), and Mant, from al-Mannn (\u0060Lord of Favours\u0027). They will be requited, in the Hereafter, the requital, for what they did -- this was [revealed] before the command to fight [them].",

  "Have they not considered, and so realised that, that there is no madness in their comrade, Muhammad (s)? He is but a clear warner, one whose warning is evident.",
  "And have they not reflected upon the dominion, the kingdom (malakt is mulk) of the heaven and of the earth, and, upon, what things God has created (min shay\u0027in is an explication of the preceding m, \u0060what\u0027), so that they are able to infer the power of their Creator and His Oneness, and, upon, that, [upon] the fact that, it may be that their term is already near, so that they might hasten to believe, lest they die as disbelievers and move towards the Fire? In what fact then after this, that is, the Qur\u0027n, will they believe?",

It weighs heavily, tremendously, in the heavens and the earth, upon their inhabitants, because of its awesomeness. It will not come on you save all of a sudden\u0027. They will question you, as if you were preoccupied with, obsessed with inquiring about, it, such that you have come to acquire knowledge of it. Say: \u0060Knowledge of it is only with God (innam \u0060ilmuh \u0060inda\u0027Llhi is for emphasis), but most people do not know\u0027, that knowledge of it lies with God, exalted be He.",

Had I knowledge of the Unseen -- that which is hidden from me, I would have acquired much good, and adversity, in the way of impoverishment and otherwise, would not touch me, since I would take precautions against such [adversity] by avoiding what is harmful. I am but a warner, to disbelievers, of the Fire, and a bearer of good tidings, of Paradise, to a people who believe\u0027.",

Then, when he covered her, when he had sexual intercourse with her, she bore a light burden, namely, the sperm-drop, and moved to and fro with it, that is, she came and went [easily] on account of its lightness; but when she became heavy, because of the child growing inside her, and they became anxious that it should be a dumb child, they cried to God their Lord, \u0060If You give us one, a child, that is sound, unimpaired, we indeed shall be of the thankful\u0027, to You for it.",
  "But when He gave them a sound one, [a sound] child, they ascribed to Him associates (shurak\u0027a: a variant reading has shirkan, meaning sharkan, \u0060an associate\u0027) in that which He had given them, by naming it \u0060Abd al-Hrith, \u0060servant of al-Hrith\u0027, when it is not right to be a \u0060servant\u0027 (\u0060abd) of any one but \u0060God\u0027 [sc. \u0060Abd Allh], but this [namesake \u0060Abd] is not an association [of another with God] in terms of servitude, for Adam was immune [from a sin such as associating others in worship with God]. Samura [b. Jundub] reported that the Prophet (s) said, \u0060On one occasion when Eve gave birth -- all the children she bore had failed to survive -- Satan visited her and said [to her], \u0022Name it [the child] \u0060Abd al-Hrith, and it will live.\u0022 She named it so and it lived. This [affair] was the result of Satan\u0027s inspiration and his doings\u0027: reported by al-Hkim, who deemed it [the report] \u0060sound\u0027 (sahh), and [also reported] by al-Tirmidh, who considered it \u0060fair-uncommon\u0027 (hasan gharb); but exalted is God above what they, the people of Mecca, associate, in the way of idols (this sentence is consequent, a supplement to [the one beginning with] khalaqakum, \u0060He created you\u0027, so that what comes between the two is a parenthetical statement).",
  "Do they associate, with Him, in worship, those who cannot create anything, but are themselves created,",
  "and who are not able to give them, that is, those who worship them, any help, nor can they help themselves?, by defending themselves against someone intending to damage them, by breaking them or otherwise (the interrogative is meant as a rebuke).",
  "And if you call them, that is, the idols, to guidance, they will not follow you (read yatba\u0060kum or yattabi\u0060kum). It will be the same [response] for you, whether you call them, to it, or whether you are silent, [refraining] from calling them, they will not follow it, because they cannot hear.",
  "Truly those on whom you call, [whom] you worship, besides God are servants, owned, like you; call them then and let them answer you, your call, if you are truthful, in [claiming] that they are gods: God then illustrates their utter incapacity and the superiority which their worshippers possess over them, saying:",
  "Have they feet wherewith they walk or, indeed, have they hands (aydin is the plural of yad) wherewith they can grasp or, indeed, have they eyes wherewith they can see or, indeed, have they ears wherewith they give ear? (an interrogative of rejection), in other words, they have none of these things, which you have, so why do you worship them when you are more complete in being than they are? Say, to them, O Muhammad (s): \u0060Call upon your associates, to destroy me; then scheme against me, and waste no time, [do not] give me any respite, for I am not concerned with you.",
  "Truly my Protector, the One in charge of my affairs, is God Who reveals the Book, the Qur\u0027n, and He takes charge of the righteous, by protecting them.",
  "And as for those on whom you call besides God, they have no power to help you, nor can they help themselves\u0027, so why should I be concerned with them?",
  "And if you call upon them, that is, the idols, to guidance, they do not hear; and you see them, that is, the idols, O Muhammad (s), staring at you, looking toward you, as a person looks, but they do not perceive.",
  "Indulge [people] with forgiveness, [accepting] what issues spontaneously from people\u0027s manners [of behaviour], and do not scrutinise them, and enjoin kindness, decency, and turn away from the ignorant, and do not counter their stupidity with the like.",
  "And if (imm: the letter nn of the conditional particle in, \u0060if\u0027, has been assimilated with the extra m, \u0060any\u0027) any insinuation from Satan should provoke you, that is, if anything should turn you away from that which you have been commanded to do, then, seek refuge in God (fa\u0027sta\u0060idh bi\u0027Llh is the response to the conditional clause, with the response to the command being omitted), and He will ward it off from you, He is Hearing, of what is said, Seeing, of what is done.",
  "Truly the God-fearing, when a visitation from Satan touches them, befalls them (tayfun: a variant reading has t\u0027ifun), that is, [when] something [of the sort] overcomes them, they remember, God\u0027s punishment and His reward, and then see clearly, [distinguishing] the truth from what is other than it, and so they return [to God].",
  "And their brothers, that is, the brothers of devils from among the disbelievers, they, the devils, lead them further into error, and, they, do not stop short, [do not] desist from it, by seeing clearly, in the way that those who are God-fearing come to see clearly.",
  "And when you do not bring them, that is, the people of Mecca, a sign, from among those which they request, they say, \u0060Why have you not chosen one?\u0027, [why have you not] produced one [all by] yourself? Say, to them: \u0060I follow only that which is revealed to me from my Lord, and it is not for me to bring anything from myself; this, Qur\u0027n, is insight, proofs, from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe\u0027.",
  "And when the Qur\u0027n is recited, listen to it and pay heed, [refraining] from speech, so that you might find mercy: this was revealed regarding [the requirement of] refraining from speech during the [mosque] sermon, which here has been expressed by [the recital of] \u0060the Qur\u0027n\u0027, because it [the sermon] comprises it; others say that it was revealed regarding the [requirement of silence and attention during the] recitation of the Qur\u0027n in general.",
  "And remember your Lord within yourself, that is, secretly, humbly, submissively, and fearfully, in awe of Him, and, louder than [speaking] in secret, more quietly than speaking out loud, that is, a middle way between the two, at morning and evening, at the beginning of the day and at its end. And do not be among the heedless, of God\u0027s remembrance.",
  "Surely those who are with your Lord, namely, the angels, are not too proud, they do [not] disdain, to worship Him; they glorify Him, exalting Him as being transcendent above what does not befit Him, and to Him they prostrate, that is, they devote their submission and worship exclusively to Him: so be like them! Medinese, except for verses 30 to 36 inclusive, which are Meccan; it consists of 75 or 77 verses, and was revealed after [srat] al-Baqara. The Muslims fell into dispute over the spoils of [the battle of] Badr. The young men said, \u0060These [spoils] should be ours because we hastened to join the fighting\u0027, while the old men said, \u0060We were your support, holding up the banners behind you; had you been exposed, you would have come back to us, so do not claim it as yours exclusively.\u0027 Thus the following was revealed:",
  "\u0060They question you, O Muhammad (s), concerning the spoils of war -- the booty -- to whom do they belong? Say, to them: \u0060The spoils of war belong to God, Who places them where He will, and the Messenger, who divides them according to God\u0027s command. The Prophet (s) divided these [spoils] between them equally, as reported by al-Hkim in his al-Mustadrak. So fear God and set things right between you, that is, [set right] the reality of that [state of affairs] which is between you, through mutual affection and the refraining from quarrelling; and obey God and His Messenger, if you are, truly, believers\u0027.",
  "The believers, those whose faith is complete, are only those who, when God is mentioned, that is, when His threat of punishment [is mentioned], their hearts tremble, fear, and when His verses are recited to them, they increase their faith, their acceptance of the truth, and who rely upon their Lord, [who] put their trust in Him [alone], and not in any other.",
  "Those who observe the prayers, performing them as they ought to be [performed], and who expend, in obedience to God, from that with which We have provided them.",
  "Those, described in the way mentioned, are the true, the real, believers, without doubt. For them are ranks, stations in Paradise, with their Lord, and forgiveness, and generous provision, in Paradise.",
  "As your Lord brought you forth from your home with the truth (bi\u0027l-haqq is semantically connected to akhraja, \u0060He brought forth\u0027), and indeed a party of the believers were averse, to going forth (the [last] sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the [suffixed pronoun] kf in akhrajaka, \u0060He brought you forth\u0027; kam, \u0060as\u0027, is the predicate of an omitted subject, in other words: their aversion to this state [of affairs of the booty being God\u0027s and the Prophet\u0027s] is similar to their aversion when you were brought forth [to fight], which had actually been better for them: likewise is this [state of affairs better for them]). It happened that Ab Sufyn was returning from Syria with a caravan. The Prophet (s) and his followers went forth to plunder it; but Quraysh became aware of this, and so Ab Jahl and some Meccan fighters rode out to defend it -- these constituted the \u0060band\u0027. Ab Sufyn drove the caravan via the coastal route and it managed to escape. Ab Jahl was then advised to return, but he refused and marched on towards Badr. The Prophet (s) consulted with his followers, saying to them, \u0060God has promised me one of the two parties\u0027. So they agreed with him to attack the [Meccan] band, but some of them were averse to this, complaining, \u0060We have not come prepared for this!\u0027, as God, exalted be He, says:",
  "They dispute with you concerning the truth, [the order] to fight, after it had become clear, [after it had] become evident to them, as though they were being driven to death while they looked, at it [death] with their very eyes, utterly averse to it.",
  "And, remember, when God promised you one of the two parties, either the caravan or the band [of Meccan fighters], that it should be yours, and you longed, you were wishing, that other than the armed one, that is, [other than] the fighting one with the weapons, in other words, [you longed that] the caravan, should be yours, because it had fewer men and less reinforcements than the band [of Mecca fighters]; but God willed that the truth be realised, [He willed] to manifest it, by His, preceding, words, that Islam should triumph; and to cut the root of the disbelievers, to the very last man, by extirpating them, and so He commanded you to fight against the band.",
  "And that He might cause the truth to be realised and annul, efface, falsehood, disbelief, however much the sinners, the idolaters, were averse, to that.",
  "When you sought help from your Lord, asking Him to help you by granting you victory over them, and He answered you [saying]: \u0060I shall reinforce you, I shall assist you, with a thousand angels, rank upon rank\u0027, one rank following after the next: God promised them this [number] at first, but it then became three thousand, and then five thousand, as stated in [srat] l \u0060Imrn [Q. 3:124-125] (a variant reading [of alf, \u0060thousand\u0027] has the plural luf, \u0060thousands\u0027, similar [in pattern] to aflus, \u0060coins\u0027).",
  "And God appointed it, that is, the reinforcement, only as good tidings, and that your hearts might thereby be reassured. Victory comes only from God: surely God is Mighty, Wise.",
  "Remember, when He caused slumber to overcome you as security, against the fear that had befallen you, from Him, from God, and sent down upon you water from the heaven, to purify you thereby, from minor and major ritual impurities; and to remove from you the evil of Satan, his whisperings to you that, had you been on the right path, you would not have been thirsty and impure, while the idolaters enjoyed [access to] water; and to strengthen, to seal, your hearts, with certainty and endurance; and to make firm your feet, lest they sink in the sand.",
  "When your Lord inspired the angels, with whom He reinforced the Muslims, [saying]: \u0060I am with you, with assistance and victorious help, so make the believers stand firm, by helping [them] and giving [them] good tidings. I shall cast terror, fear, into the hearts of the disbelievers; so smite above the necks, that is, the heads, and smite of them every finger!\u0027, that is, [smite] the extremities of their hands and feet: thus, when one of them went to strike an disbeliever\u0027s head, it would roll off before his sword reached it. The Prophet (s) threw a handful of pebbles against them and every single idolater was struck in his eye, and thus they were defeated.",
  "That, chastisement befalling them is, because they had contended with, they had opposed, God and His Messenger: whoever contends with God and with His Messenger, surely God is severe in retribution, against him.",
  "That, chastisement, is for you, so taste it, O disbelievers, in this world; and [know] that for the disbelievers, in the Hereafter, is the chastisement of the Fire.",
  "O you who believe, when you encounter the disbelievers inching forward, that is, amassed, advancing slowly because of their large numbers, do not turn your backs to them, fleeing.",
  "Whoever turns his back to them on that day, the day of the encounter with them, unless manoeuvring, turning around, for battle -- by pretending to be in flight, as a trick, while actually intending to relaunch an attack -- or joining another detachment, a company of Muslims, calling on it for assistance, he has truly incurred the wrath of God, and his abode will be Hell -- an evil journey\u0027s end!, [an evil] return it is. This [threat] applies so long as the [numbers of] disbelievers do not surpass twice [that of the believers].",
  "You did not slay them, at Badr by your own might, but God slew them, by giving you assistance, and you threw not, O Muhammad (s), [against] the eyes of the [unbelieving] folk, when you threw, the pebbles, for a handful of pebbles thrown by a human being cannot strike the eyes of [every person in] a large troop, but God threw, by making that [throw] reach them. He did this in order to vanquish the disbelievers, and that He might try the believers with a fair test, a [fair] gift, namely, booty; surely God is Hearing, of their sayings, Knowing, of their conditions.",
  "That is, the true gift, for you, and [know] that God weakens the plan of the disbelievers.",
  "If you have sought a judgement, O disbelievers, if you have sought a decisive conclusion [of this battle] -- Ab Jahl had said, \u0060O God! Whoever among [the two of] us is the one who has severed the ties of kinship and brought us what we had never known, destroy them today!\u0027 -- the judgement, the decisive conclusion, has now come to you, by the fact that the one so described has [already] perished: this was Ab Jahl and those killed with him, and not the Prophet (s) and the believers; and if you desist, from unbelief and waging war, it will better for you. But if you return, to fight against the Prophet (s), We shall return, to assist him against you, and your host, your troops, will not avail, will not protect, you in any way, however numerous it be; and verily God is with the believers (read thus inna, indicating a new sentence; or read anna, with an implicit lm [li-anna\u0060Llha ma\u0060a\u0027l-mu\u0027minn, \u0060because God is with the believers\u0027]).",
  "O you who believe, obey God and His Messenger, and do not turn away from Him, by contravening His command, while you are listening, to the Qur\u0027n and the admonitions.",
  "And do not be as those who say, \u0060We hear,\u0027 and they hear not, in such a way as to reflect and heed admonition -- these are either the hypocrites or the idolaters.",
  "Surely the worst of beasts in God\u0027s sight are those who are deaf, to hearing the truth, and dumb, [unable] to utter it, those who do not understand.",
  "For had God known of any good in them, any righteousness, were they to listen to the truth, He would have made them hear, in such a way as to understand; and had He made them hear -- hypothetically speaking -- already knowing that there is no good in them, they would have turned away, from it, averse, to accepting it, out of obstinacy and in denial.",
  "O you who believe, respond to God and the Messenger, with obedience, when He calls you to that which will give you life, in the matter of religion, for it will be the source of everlasting life [for you]; and know that God comes in between a man and his heart, so that he cannot believe or disbelieve except by His will; and that it is to Him that you shall be gathered, and He will requite you for your deeds.",
  "And be afraid of a trial which, if it were to fall upon you, would certainly not fall exclusively upon the evildoers among you, but would encompass them and others, and the way to guard against it is to repudiate that evil which necessarily results in [precipitating] it; and know that God is severe in retribution, against those who oppose Him.",
  "And remember when you were few and oppressed in the land, the land of Mecca, and were fearful lest men should snatch you away, [lest] the disbelievers should seize you swiftly; how He gave you refuge, in Medina, and reinforced you, strengthened you, with His help, on the day of Badr, with the angels, and provided you with the good things, the spoils, that you might be thankful, for His graces.",
  "The following was revealed regarding Ab Lubba Marwn b. \u0060Abd al-Mundhir: the Prophet (s) had dispatched him to the Ban Qurayza so that they would submit to his [the Prophet\u0027s] authority. But they [Ban Qurayza] consulted with him [as to whether they should cede], and he pointed out to them that a slaughter would ensue -- for members of his family and his property were among them: O you who believe, do not betray God and the Messenger, and, do not, betray your trusts, that which has been entrusted to you, in the way of religion or otherwise, while you are aware.",
  "And know that your wealth and your children are a trial, for you, impeding you from the concerns of the Hereafter; and that with God is a tremendous wage, so do not forfeit it by giving [undue] attention to wealth and children, acting treacherously for the sake of [preserving] them.",
  "The following was revealed regarding his [Ab Lubba\u0027s] repentance: O you who believe, if you fear God, by turning [in repentance] to Him and in other ways, He will grant you a [means of] separation, between yourselves and what you fear, so that you will be delivered, and absolve you of your evil deeds, and forgive you, your sins; and God is of tremendous bounty.",
  "And, remember, O Muhammad (s), when the disbelievers -- who had gathered to discuss your affair at the council assembly -- were plotting against you, to confine you, to chain you up and imprison you, or slay you -- all of them [acting as] assassins of one man -- or to expel you, from Mecca, and they were plotting, against you, and God was plotting, against them, by devising a way [out] for you, when He revealed to you what they had devised and commanded you to leave [Mecca]; and God is the best of those who plot, the most knowledgeable among them about it.",
  "And when Our verses, namely, the Qur\u0027n, were being recited to them, they said, \u0060We have already heard! If we wish we can speak the like of this -- al-Nadr b. al-Hrith said this, for he used to travel on trading business to al-Hra, where he would buy books containing the tales of the Persians, and would recount these to the Meccans; this, Qur\u0027n, is nothing but the fables, the lies, of the ancients\u0027.",
  "And when they said, \u0060O God! If this, that Muhammad (s) recites, be indeed the truth, revealed, from You, then rain down stones upon us from the heaven, or bring on us a painful chastisement\u0027, in return for [our] denial of it: this was said by al-Nadr and others, in mockery and in delusion that he had some insight and certainty about it [the Qur\u0027n] being false.",
  "God then says: But God was not about to chastise them, for what they requested, while you were among them, for when chastisement is sent down it is all-encompassing, and no community was ever chastised except after its prophet and the believers had departed from it; nor was God about to chastise them while they sought forgiveness, crying, as they performed the circumambulations: \u0060Your forgiveness! Your forgiveness!\u0027; it is also said that this [last clause] refers to those oppressed believers among them, similar to where God says Had they been clearly separated, verily We would have chastised the disbelievers among them with a painful chastisement [Q. 48:25].",
  "But what [plea] have they now, that God should not chastise them, with the sword, after your departure and that of the oppressed [believers] -- if this [verse] is understood in accordance with the first opinion [that it refers to the idolaters asking forgiveness], then it abrogates the previous one, for God had chastised them at Badr and in other instances -- when they bar, prevent the Prophet (s) and the Muslims, from the Sacred Mosque, [from] performing circumambulations there, though they are not its guardians?, as they claim? Its only [rightful] guardians are the God-fearing, but most of them do not know, that they have no [rightful] custodianship over it.",
  "And their prayer at the [Sacred] House is nothing but whistling and hand-clapping: in other words they do this in place of the prayer which they were ordered to perform -- therefore taste now, at Badr, the chastisement for your unbelief!",
  "The disbelievers expend their wealth, in waging war against the Prophet (s), in order to bar from God\u0027s way, and they will expend it until, in the end, it will be a source of anguish for them, a regret, for having lost it and lost what they had intended [by expending it]; then they will be defeated, in this world, and the disbelievers, among them, will be gathered, driven, into Hell, in the Hereafter,",
  "that God may distinguish (read li-yamza, or li-yumayyiza, is semantically connected to taknu, \u0060it will be\u0027 [from the previous verse]) the wicked, the disbeliever, from the good, the believer, and place the wicked one upon another, and heap them up all together and put them in Hell: those, they are the losers.",
  "Say to the disbelievers, such as Ab Sufyn and his companions, that if they desist, from unbelief and from waging war against the Prophet (s), that which is past, of their deeds, will be forgiven them; but if they return, to waging war against him, the way of [dealing with] the ancients has already gone before!, that is, Our way [in dealing] with them, by destroying them: We will do the same with these ones.",
  "And fight them until sedition, idolatry, is, exists, no more and religion is all for God, alone, none other being worshipped; then if they desist, from unbelief, surely God sees what they do, and will requite them for it.",
  "But if they turn away, from belief, know that God is your Protector, your Helper and the One Who takes charge of your affairs -- an excellent Protector, is He, and an excellent Helper!, [He is] for you.",
  "And know that whatever spoils you have taken, [you have] seized from the disbelievers by force, the fifth of it is for God, to have it dispensed as He will, and for the Messenger and for the kinsmen, the kinsmen of the Prophet (s) from among the Ban Hshim and the Ban [\u0060Abd] al-Muttalib, and the orphans, children of Muslims, those whose fathers have passed away and are in poverty, and the needy, those Muslims in [dire] need, and the traveller, those Muslims cut off during travel -- in other words it [the fifth] is due to the Prophet (s) and [those of] these four categories in the way that he used to apportion it: a fifth of the fifth for each one and the remaining four fifths for those who had captured the spoils, if you believe in God, then be aware of that, and that which (wa-m is a supplement to bi\u0027Llhi, \u0060in God\u0027) We sent down upon Our servant, Muhammad (s), in the way of angels and signs, on the Day of Discrimination, that is, the day of [the battle of] Badr, which discriminated between truth and falsehood, the day the two armies, the Muslims and the believers, met. And God has power over all things, including giving you victory despite your being few and their being greater in number.",
  "When (idh substitutes for yawma, \u0060the day\u0027) you were on the nearer bank, the one nearer to Medina (read \u0060udwa or \u0060idwa, meaning \u0060the side of a valley\u0027), and they were on the yonder bank, the one further from it, and the cavalcade, the caravan, was, in a place, below you, the coastal side; and had you, and the [enemy] band, agreed to meet, for battle, you would have surely failed to keep meeting; but, He brought you together at a different time, that God might conclude a matter that was to be done, through His knowledge -- namely, the victory of Islam and the obliteration of unbelief -- He did this so, that he who perished might perish, might be a disbeliever [even], after a clear proof, that is, after a manifest proof has been established against him, namely, the triumph of the believers, despite their small number, over the larger [enemy] army; and that he who survived might live, might believe, after a clear proof; surely God is Hearing, Knowing.",
  "Remember, when God showed them to you in your dream, in your sleep, as few, and so you informed your companions of this, and they were delighted, and had He shown them to you as many, you would have faltered, shrunk in cowardice, and quarrelled, fallen into disagreement, over the matter, the matter of fighting; but God saved, you, from faltering and quarrelling. He knows that which is in the breasts, that which is in the hearts.",
  "And when God made you see them, O believers, when you met -- in your eyes as few, as 70 or 100, when they were [in fact] 1000, so that you would advance against them; and He made you seem as few in their eyes, so that they would advance and not turn back from fighting you -- this was before close combat had begun, but when it began, He made them [the disbelievers] see these [believers] as twice their number, as stated in srat l \u0060Imrn [Q. 3:13] -- so that God might conclude a matter that was to be done; and to God all things are returned, reverting.",
  "O you who believe, when you meet a host, a group of disbelievers, then stand firm, to fight them and do not [flee in] retreat, and remember God much, call upon Him for victory, that you may succeed, [that you may] triumph.",
  "And obey God and His Messenger, and do not quarrel with one another, do [not] fall into dispute with one another, lest you falter, become cowardly, and your strength, your power and dominion, fade; and be patient. Surely God is with the patient, giving them victory and assistance.",
  "And do not be like those who went forth from their dwellings, to defend their caravan and but did not return after it had passed safely, in recklessness and to show off to men -- when they said, \u0060We will not return until we have drunk wine, sacrificed the camels, and have been entertained by singers at Badr, and [until] people have heard about this -- barring, people, from the way of God, while God encompasses, in knowledge, what they do (ya\u0060malna, also read ta\u0060malna, \u0060you do\u0027), and will requite them for it.",
  "And, mention, that Satan, Ibls, adorned their deeds for them, by encouraging them [to go] to meet the Muslims, when they had feared to set out on account of their enemy, the Ban Bakr, and said, to them: \u0060Today no person shall overcome you, for I shall be your protector\u0027, from among the [Ban] Kinna -- he appeared to them in the form of Surqa b. Mlik, the chieftain of that region. But when the two armies, the Muslims and the disbelievers, sighted each other, [when] they met and he [Satan] saw the angels, his hand clasping that of al-Hrith b. Hishm, he turned his back, he withdrew, in flight, saying -- when they had said to him, \u0060Are you abandoning us in such a predicament?\u0027, \u0060I am quit of you, of being your protector, for I see what you do not see, in the way of angels. I fear God, lest He destroy me; and God is severe in retribution\u0027.",
  "When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a sickness, a weakness of faith, said, \u0060Their religion has deluded them\u0027, that is, the Muslims, for they had set out to fight a large army despite their small number, in the mistaken belief that they will be victorious because of this. God, exalted be He, says in response to them: but whoever relies on God, [whoever] puts his trust in Him, he will triumph; for truly God is Mighty, His way will prevail, Wise, in His actions.",
  "And if you could only see, O Muhammad (s), when the angels take (read either as yatawaff or tatawaff) the disbelievers, beating (yadribna is a circumstantial qualifier) their faces and their backs, with hooked iron rods, and, they say to them: \u0060Taste the chastisement of burning, that is, the Fire (the response to the [clause beginning with] law, \u0060if\u0027, would be la-ra\u0027ayta amran \u0060azman, \u0060you would truly have seen an terrible sight\u0027).",
  "That, chastisement, is for what your hands have sent before you -- He refers to this [their actions] exclusively with these [hands], because most actions are accomplished with them -- and [know] that God is never unjust to His servants\u0027, such that he would punish them for no sin.",
  "The way of these people is, like the way of Pharaoh\u0027s folk and those before them: they disbelieved in God\u0027s signs and so God seized them, with chastisement, because of their sins (the sentence beginning with kafar, \u0060they disbelieved\u0027, explains the previous one). Truly, God is strong, in what He wills, severe in retribution.",
  "That, chastisement of the disbelievers, is because God would never change a grace that He had conferred on a people, substituting it with affliction, until they have changed that which is in themselves, [until] they have exchanged the grace conferred upon them for unbelief, in the way that the Meccan disbelievers exchanged their being \u0060fed against hunger\u0027, their being made \u0060safe from fear\u0027 [cf. Q. 106:4] and the sending of the Prophet (s) to them, for unbelief, [for] barring against the way of God and [for] fighting Muslims; and [know] that God is Hearing, Knowing.",
  "Like the way of Pharaoh\u0027s folk and those before them: they denied the signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them for their sins, and We drowned the folk of Pharaoh, his people together with him, and all, disbelieving communities, were evildoers.",
  "The following was revealed regarding [Ban] Qurayza: Surely the worst of beasts in God\u0027s sight are the ungrateful who will not believe,",
  "those of them with whom you have made a pact, not to support the idolaters, and then break their pact every time, they conclude one, and they are not fearful, of God, in their treachery.",
  "So if (fa-imm: here the letter nn of the conditional particle in, \u0060if\u0027, has been assimilated with the extra m) you come upon them, [if] you find them, anywhere in the war, [deal with them so as to] cause those, fighters, behind them to scatter, to disperse, by making an example of them and punishing them, so that they, the ones behind them, might remember, [that they might] take heed from their example.",
  "And if you fear, from any folk, who have concluded a pact with you, some treachery, in a pact, through some indication that comes to you, then cast it back to them, dissolve their pact, with fairness (\u0060al saw\u0027 is a circumstantial qualifier), that is to say, while you and they have equal knowledge that the pact has been broken, by your apprising them thereof, lest they accuse you of treachery. Truly God does not love the treacherous.",
  "The following was revealed regarding those who escaped capture on the day of Badr: And do not, O Muhammad (s), let those who disbelieve suppose that they have outstripped, God, that is, [that] they have eluded Him: indeed they cannot escape, they cannot elude Him (a variant reading has wa-l yahsabanna, \u0060and do not let them suppose\u0027, so that the first direct object is omitted, actually being [an implied] anfusahum, \u0060themselves\u0027 [sc. \u0060and do not let them suppose themselves to have outstripped\u0027]; and according to another [variant reading] anna is read [instead of inna] with an implicit lm [sc. \u0060because they cannot escape\u0027]).",
  "Make ready for them, for fighting them, whatever force you can, the Prophet (s) said that this refers to \u0060archers\u0027, as reported by Muslim, and of horses tethered (ribt is a verbal noun, meaning, \u0060restraining them [for use] in the way of God\u0027) that thereby you may dismay, terrify, the enemy of God and your enemy, namely, the disbelievers of Mecca, and others besides them, that is, other than those -- namely, the hypocrites or the Jews, whom you know not: God knows them. And whatever thing you expend in the way of God, its requital, shall be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged, [you will not] be diminished anything thereof.",
  "And if they incline to peace (read silm or salm, meaning, \u0060settlement\u0027), then incline to it, and conclude a pact with them: Ibn \u0060Abbs said, \u0060This has been abrogated by the \u0022sword verse\u0022 [Q. 9:5]\u0027; Mujhid said, \u0060This [stipulation] applies exclusively in the context of the People of the Scripture, for it was revealed regarding the Ban Qurayza; and rely on God, put your trust in Him; truly He is the Hearer, of words, the Knower, of actions.",
  "And if they desire to trick you, by making a [peace] settlement in order to make preparations [for war] against you, then God is sufficient for you. He it is Who strengthened you with His help and with the believers;",
  "and reconciled, brought together, their hearts, after old feuds [had divided them]. Had you expended all that is in the earth, you could not have reconciled their hearts, but God reconciled their hearts, through His power. Truly He is Mighty, His way prevailing, Wise, nothing being beyond [the scope of] His wisdom.",
  "O Prophet, God suffices you, and the believers who follow you, suffice you.",
  "O Prophet, urge on, exhort, the believers to fight, the disbelievers. If there be twenty of you, steadfast, they will overcome two hundred, of them. If there be (read as yakun or takun) a hundred of you, they will overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, for they are a people who do not understand (this [sentence] is predicative, but functions as an imperative, in other words, let the twenty of you fight the two hundred [of them], and the hundred [of you], the thousand [of them], and let them stand firm against them; but when they became numerous this was abrogated by God\u0027s saying):",
  "Now God has lightened [the burden] for you, for He knows that there is weakness (read du\u0060fan or da\u0060fan) in you, [making you unable] to fight ten times your number. So if there be (read as yakun or takun) a hundred of you, steadfast, they will overcome two hundred, of them; and if there be a thousand of you, they will overcome two thousand by the leave of God, by His will (this is predicative, functioning as an imperative, in other words: fight twice your number and stand firm against them). And God is with the steadfast, by His support [of them].",
  "The following was revealed when they ransomed those taken captive at Badr: It is not for any Prophet to have (read as an takna lahu or an yakna lahu) prisoners until he has made slaughter in the land, going all the way in fighting disbelievers. You, O believers, desire the transient things of this world, its ephemeral gains, by ransoming, while God desires, for you, the Hereafter, that is, its reward, through your killing them; and God is Mighty, Wise: this was abrogated by His words [and set them free] afterward either with grace or by ransom [Q. 47:4].",
  "Had it not been for an ordinance from God which had preceded, making spoils and the taking of captives lawful for you, an awful chastisement would have afflicted you for what you took, as ransom.",
  "Now eat of what you have plundered, as lawful and good, and fear God. Truly God is Forgiving, Merciful.",
  "O Prophet, say to those captives who are in your hands: (asr, may also be read as asr) \u0060If God knows of any good, any faith or sincere devotion, in your hearts He will give you better than that which has been taken from you, by way of ransom, by His multiplying it for you in this world and rewarding you in the Hereafter, and will forgive you, your sins. Truly God is Forgiving, Merciful\u0027.",
  "And if they, the captives, desire to betray you, through words which they speak [to you], they have betrayed God before, before Badr, through unbelief; but He has given [you] power over them, at Badr, through slaying and capture, so let them anticipate the like if they return [to betrayal]; and God is Knower, of His creatures, Wise, in His actions.",
  "Truly those who believed and emigrated and strove with their wealth and their lives in the way of God, these being the Emigrants, and those who provided refuge, for the Prophet (s), and assisted, these being the Helpers, those are allies of one another, in terms of [mutual] support and inheritance. And those who believed but did not emigrate -- you have no duty to make an alliance (read wilya or walya) with them, and so there is no inheriting between you and them and no share of the spoils for them, until they emigrate, this was abrogated by the end of this sra; but if they ask you for assistance in the matter of religion then it is your duty to assist, them against the disbelievers, except against a folk between whom and you there is a covenant, a pact: in which case, do not assist them against these others and so break your pact; and God sees what you do.",
  "And those who disbelieve are allies of one another, in terms of [mutual] support and inheritance, and so there is no inheriting between you and them. Unless you do this, [unless] you ally yourselves with the believers and sever relations with the disbelievers, there will be sedition in the land and great corruption, with disbelief gaining power and Islam becoming weak.",
  "And those who believed and emigrated and strove for the way of God, and those who provided refuge and assisted -- those are the true believers, and for them is forgiveness and a generous provision, in Paradise.",
  "And those who believed afterwards, that is, after the first believers and emigrants, and emigrated and strove with you -- they are of you, O Muhjirn and Ansr; and those related by blood, kinsmen, are nearer to one another, in terms of inheritance, than [those who share] inheritance on account of [their common] faith and emigration mentioned in the previous verse, according to the Book of God, the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al- mahfz). Truly God is Knower of all things, including the wisdom regarding [the rules of] inheritance. Medinese [entirely], or [Medinese] except for the last two verses ending with verse 130 [which are Meccan], or [Medinese] except for one verse. The basmala, \u0060In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful\u0027, does not preface this [sra] because the Prophet (s) was not commanded to [recite] it [in this way], as may be understood from a hadth reported by al-Hkim, in which he states [by way of an isnd] from \u0060Al that the basmala is [invoked] for \u0060security\u0027 (amn), whereas this [sra] was revealed to remove security by way of the sword. According to [a hadth related] by Hudhayfa [b. al-Yamn]: \u0060You call it the sra of Repentance, but it is actually the sra of Chastisement (al-\u0060adhb)\u0027. Al-Bukhr reported [by way of an isnd] from al-Bar\u0027 [b. \u0060zib] that this was the last sra to be revealed.",
  "This is: A declaration of immunity from God and His Messenger to, reach, the idolaters with whom you made a pact, a pact for an indefinite period of time, or one for [a period of] less than, or more than, four months; the annulment of the pact shall be as God mentions in His saying:",
  "\u0060Journey freely, travel in security, O idolaters, in the land for four months -- beginning with [the month of] Shawwl, on the basis of what will come shortly -- after which there will be no security for you, and know that you cannot escape God, that is, you shall [not] elude His punishment, and that God degrades the disbelievers\u0027, humiliating them in this world by having them killed, and in the Hereafter, by [sending them to] the Fire.",
  "A proclamation, a notification, from God and His Messenger to mankind on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage, the Day of Sacrifice (yawm al-nahr), that God is free from obligation to the idolaters, and their pacts, and [so is] His Messenger, also free from obligation: in that same year, year 9 [of the Hijra], the Prophet (s) sent forth \u0060Al, who proclaimed these verses on the Day of Sacrifice at Min, and also [he proclaimed] that after this year no idolater will [be allowed to] make pilgrimage or circumambulate the House naked, as reported by al-Bukhr. So, if you repent, of unbelief, it will be better for you; but if you turn away, from belief, then know that you cannot escape God. And give tidings to -- inform -- those who disbelieve of a painful chastisement, namely, [of] slaughter or capture in this world, and of [punishment in] the Fire in the Hereafter.",
  "Excepting those of the idolaters with whom you have made a pact, and who have not diminished [their commitment to] you in anyway, with regard to the terms of the pact, nor supported, assisted, anyone, from among the disbelievers, against you; [as for these] fulfil your pact with them until, the completion of, the term, to which you have agreed. Truly God loves those who fear [Him], by fulfilling pacts.",
  "Then, when the sacred months have passed -- that is, [at] the end of the period of deferment -- slay the idolaters wherever you find them, be it during a lawful [period] or a sacred [one], and take them, captive, and confine them, to castles and forts, until they have no choice except [being put to] death or [acceptance of] Islam; and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush, [at every] route that they use (kulla, \u0060every\u0027, is in the accusative because a [preceding] genitive-taking preposition has been removed). But if they repent, of unbelief, and establish prayer and pay the alms, then leave their way free, and do not interfere with them. God is Forgiving, Merciful, to those who repent.",
  "And if any one of the idolaters (ahadun, \u0060one\u0027, is in the nominative because of the [following] verb [istajraka, \u0060seeks your protection\u0027] that validates it) seeks your protection, requests security from you against being killed, then grant him protection, provide security for him, so that he might hear the words of God -- the Qur\u0027n -- and afterward convey him to his place of security, that is, the dwelling-places of his folk, if he does not believe, so that he might reflect upon his situation -- that, which is mentioned, is because they are a people who do not know, the religion of God, and so they must [be made to] hear the Qur\u0027n in order to [come to] know [religion].",
  "How can the idolaters have a pact with God and His Messenger -- they cannot --while they disbelieve in God and His Messenger, acting treacherously; except for those with whom you made a pact at the Sacred Mosque?, the day of al-Hudaybiyya -- these were Quraysh, for whom an exception was made earlier [Q. 9:4]. So long as they are true to you, keeping to the pact and not breaking it, be true to them, by fulfilling it (fa-m, \u0060so long as\u0027: the m is a conditional particle). Truly God loves the God-fearing: the Prophet (s) had kept to the pact made with them until they broke it by supporting the Ban Bakr against Khuz\u0060a.",
  "How, can they have a pact, when, if they get the better of you, [if] they have the upper hand over you, they do not respect, [they do not] take into consideration, any bond, kinship, or treaty, pact, with regard to you, but will instead harm you as much as they can (the conditional sentence [\u0060if they ...\u0027] is [also] a circumstantial qualifier), pleasing you with their tongues, with charming words, while their hearts refuse, to be true to these [words]; and most of them are wicked, violators of pacts.",
  "They have purchased with the signs of God, the Qur\u0027n, a small price, of this world, that is, they have refrained from following them in favour of passions and whims, and have barred [people] from His way, His religion. Truly evil is that, deed of theirs, which they are wont to do.",
  "They respect neither bond [of kinship] nor treaty with regard to a believer; those, they are the transgressors.",
  "Yet if they repent and establish prayer and pay the alms, then they are your brothers in religion; and We detail, We explain, the signs for a people who know, [who] reflect.",
  "But if they break, [if] they violate, their oaths, their covenants, after [making] their pact and assail your religion, slander it, then fight the leaders of unbelief, its heads (here an overt noun [\u0060the leaders of unbelief\u0027] has replaced the [third person] pronominalisation) -- verily they have no [binding] oaths, [no] pacts (a variant reading [for aymn, \u0060oaths\u0027] has the kasra inflection [for the alif, sc. mn, \u0060[no] faith\u0027]) -- so that they might desist, from unbelief.",
  "Will you not (a-l, \u0060will not\u0027 or \u0060is not\u0027, denotes incitement) fight a people who broke, violated, their oaths, their pacts, and intended to expel the Messenger, from Mecca -- for they discussed this between them in their council assembly -- initiating, combat, against you first?, when they fought alongside Ban Bakr against Khuz\u0060a, your allies? So what is stopping you from fighting them? Are you afraid of them? God is more worthy of your fear, when you fail to fight them, if you are believers.",
  "Fight them, and God will chastise them, He will have them killed, at your hands and degrade them, humiliate them through capture and subjugation, and He will give you victory against them, and He will heal the breasts of a people who believe, [removing the harm] done to them -- these are the Ban Khuz\u0060a.",
  "And He will remove the rage, the grief, in their hearts. God turns [in forgiveness] to whomever He will, when they return to Islam, as in the case of Ab Sufyn. And God is Knowing, Wise.",
  "Or (am has the meaning of the [initial a-] hamza used to express disavowal) did you suppose that you would be left [in peace] when God does not yet know, that is, through knowledge outwardly manifested, those of you who have struggled, sincerely, and have not taken, besides God and His Messenger and the believers, an intimate friend?, as a confidant or an ally? In other words: when it has not yet become manifest who the sincere ones are -- those described in the exclusive way mentioned. And God is aware of what you do.",
  "It is not for the idolaters to attend God\u0027s places of worship (masjid, is also read in the singular, masjid), entering them or sitting in them, bearing witness, against themselves, to unbelief; those, their works have failed, [their works] are invalid, and in the Fire they shall abide.",
  "Only he shall attend God\u0027s places of worship who believes in God and the Last Day, and observes prayer, and pays the alms, and fears none but God alone; it may be that those will be among the rightly guided.",
  "Do you reckon the giving of water to pilgrims and the attendance of the Sacred Mosque, that is, [do you reckon] those who do such things, to be the same as he who believes in God and the Last Day and struggles in the way of God? They are not equal, in merit, in God\u0027s sight; and God guides not the evildoing, the disbelieving, folk: this was revealed to refute those who claimed this, such as al-\u0060Abbs and others.",
  "Those who believe, and have emigrated, and have struggled in the way of God with their possessions and their lives are greater in degree, in rank, with God, than others; and those, they are the triumphant, the ones who will attain good.",
  "Their Lord gives them good tidings of mercy from Him and beatitude; for them shall be gardens wherein is enduring, everlasting, bliss,",
  "therein they shall abide forever (khlidna is an implied circumstance). Surely with God is a tremendous reward.",
  "The following was revealed regarding those who refrained from emigrating because of their families and trade: O you who believe, do not take your fathers and brothers for your friends, if they prefer, if they have chosen, disbelief over belief; whoever of you takes them for friends, such are the evildoers.",
  "Say: \u0060If your fathers, and your sons, and your brothers, and your wives, and your clan, your kinsmen (\u0060ashratukum: a variant reading has \u0060ashrtukum), and the possessions which you have acquired, and merchandise for which you fear there may be no sale, no longer viable, and dwellings which you love, are dearer to you than God and His Messenger and struggling in His way, so that you have refrained from emigrating and struggling for the sake of such [things], then wait until God brings about His command -- this is meant as a threat to them. And God does not guide the wicked folk\u0027.",
  "God has already helped you on many fields, of battle, such as Badr, and [against] Qurayza and al-Nadr, and, remember, on the day of Hunayn -- a valley between Mecca and T\u0027if; that is, [remember] the day on which you fought Hawzin -- this was in Shawwl in year 8 [of the Hijra], when (idh substitutes for yawma, \u0060the day\u0027) your vast numbers were pleasing to you, such that you were saying, \u0060We shall not be defeated today, not on account of our being few\u0027: and they numbered 12,000, while the disbelievers were 4,000); but it availed you nothing and the earth, for all its breadth (bi-m rahubat, the m refers to the verbal noun, in other words [understand it as being] ma\u0060a rahbih, \u0060despite its breadth\u0027), it was straitened for you, such that you could not find a place in which you felt secure, because of the severe fear that afflicted you; then you turned back, retreating, fleeing: the Prophet (s), however, on his white mule remained firm, with only al- \u0060Abbs by his side, while Ab Sufyn was charging on his mount.",
  "Then God sent down His Spirit of Peace, His reassurance, upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and so they turned back towards the Prophet (s), after al-\u0060Abbs called them, with his [the Prophet\u0027s] permission, and they fought [once again]; and He sent down legions, of angels, you did not see, and chastised the disbelievers, with slaughter and capture, and that is the requital of the disbelievers.",
  "Then afterwards God will relent to whom He will, from among them, by [their acceptance of] Islam. And God is Forgiving, Merciful.",
  "O you who believe, the idolaters are indeed unclean, [they are] filth, on account of their inner vileness, so do not let them come near the Sacred Mosque, that is, let them not enter the Sanctuary, after this year of theirs, year 9 of the Hijra. If you fear impoverishment, poverty, as a result of the cessation of their commerce with you, God will surely enrich you from His bounty, if He will: and He indeed enriched them through conquests and [the imposition of] the jizya. God is Knowing, Wise.",
  "Fight those who do not believe in God, nor in the Last Day, for, otherwise, they would have believed in the Prophet (s), and who do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden, such as wine, nor do they practise the religion of truth, the firm one, the one that abrogated other religions, namely, the religion of Islam -- from among of those who (min, \u0060from\u0027, explains [the previous] alladhna, \u0060those who\u0027) have been given the Scripture, namely, the Jews and the Christians, until they pay the jizya tribute, the annual tax imposed them, readily (\u0060an yadin is a circumstantial qualifier, meaning, \u0060compliantly\u0027, or \u0060by their own hands\u0027, not delegating it [to others to pay]), being subdued, [being made] submissive and compliant to the authority of Islam.",
  "The Jews say: Ezra is the son of God; and the Christians say: The Messiah, Jesus, is the son of God. That is the utterance of their mouths, for which they have no support, nay, imitating the utterances of those who disbelieved before [them], from among their forefathers, mimicking them. God assail, curse, them! How they are deviated!, turned away from the truth, despite the proofs having been established.",
  "They have taken their rabbis, the scholars among the Jews, and their monks, the devout among the Christians, as lords beside God -- following them in making lawful what God has made unlawful and making unlawful what He has made lawful -- and the Messiah, son of Mary, when they were not commanded, in the Torah and the Gospel, except to worship One God: there is no god except Him; glory be to Him, as an affirmation of His transcendence [high], above what they associate [with Him].",
  "They desire to extinguish God\u0027s light, His Law and His proofs, with their tongues, with what they say about Him; and God refuses but to perfect, to make manifest, His light, even though the disbelievers be averse, to this.",
  "He it is Who has sent His Messenger, Muhammad (s), with the guidance and the religion of truth, that He may manifest it, make it prevail, over every religion, all the religions which oppose it, even though the disbelievers be averse, to this.",
  "O you who believe, many of the rabbis and monks indeed consume, take, people\u0027s goods by false means, as in the case of bribes [paid] for judgements, and bar, people, from the way of God, [from] His religion. And those who (wa\u0027lladhna is the subject) hoard up gold and silver, and do not expend them, these treasure- hoards, in the way of God, that is, they do not pay from it what is due to Him by way of alms and charity -- give them tidings, inform them, of a painful chastisement.",
  "On the day when it shall be heated in the fire of Hell and therewith their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded, burnt -- their skins will be stretched until these [hoards of gold and silver] can be placed on them entirely, and it will be said to them: \u0060This is what you hoarded up for yourselves: so taste now what you used to hoard!\u0027, that is, [taste] its requital.",
  "Verily the number of months, used to reckon the year, with God is twelve months in the Book of God, the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahfz), from the day that He created the heavens and the earth; four of them, that is, the months, are sacred, inviolable: Dh\u0027l-Qa\u0060da, Dh\u0027l-Hijja, Muharram and Rajab. That, making of them sacred, is the right, the upright, religion. So do not wrong yourselves during them, during these sacred months, with acts of disobedience, for their burden [of sin] is greater therein; but it is also said to mean [do not wrong yourselves] at any time during all the months [of the year]. And fight the idolaters altogether, all of them, throughout the months, even as they fight you altogether; and know that God is with those who fear Him, supporting and assisting [them].",
  "Postponement [of the sacred month] -- that is, the deferment of the sacredness of a given month to another, as they used to do during paganism, such as postponing the sacredness of Muharram, if it arrives while they are at war, to Safar -- is only an excess of unbelief, because of their rejection of God\u0027s ruling thereof, whereby those who disbelieve are led astray (yudallu may also be read yadillu, \u0060[they] go astray\u0027), one year they make it, the month postponed, profane, and hallow it another, that they may make up, by profaning one month and hallowing another in its place, the number, of months, which God has hallowed, such that they do not hallow more, or less, than the four months, but without observing the individual months themselves; and so they profane what God has hallowed. Their evil deeds have been adorned for them, such that they deem them to be good [deeds]; and God does not guide the disbelieving folk.",
  "When the Prophet (s) summoned men for the Tabk campaign, and they thought it too burdensome, because of the hardship and the extreme heat from which they were suffering, the following was revealed: O you who believe, what is wrong with you that, when it is said to you, \u0060Go forth in the way of God,\u0027 you sink down heavily (iththqaltum: the original t\u0027 [of tathqaltum] has been assimilated with the th\u0027, and the conjunctive hamza has been supplied), in other words, you hesitate and are disinclined to [participate in] the struggle, to the ground, to stay sitting upon it? (the interrogative is meant as a rebuke). Are you so content with the life of this world, and its delights, rather than with the Hereafter?, that is, in place of its bliss? Yet the enjoyment of the life of this world is, in, comparison with the enjoyment of, the Hereafter but little, trivial.",
  "If (ill: l has been assimilated with the nn of the conditional particle in, in both instances [here and in the next verse]) you do not go forth, [if you do not] set out with the Prophet (s) for the struggle, He will chastise you with a painful chastisement, and He will substitute [you with] another folk other than you, that is, He will bring them in your place, and you will not hurt Him, that is, God, or [\u0060him\u0027 as being] the Prophet (s), at all, should you neglect to help him [to victory], for God [Himself] will indeed bring victory to His religion; for God has power over all things, including bringing victory to His religion and His Prophet.",
  "If you do not help him, that is, the Prophet (s), [know that] God has already helped him, when the disbelievers drove him forth, from Mecca, that is, they made him resort to leaving, when they desired to kill him or imprison him or banish him at the council assembly -- the second of two (thniya ithnayn: this is a circumstantial qualifier), that is, one of two, the other being Ab Bakr: in other words, just as God helped him in such a situation, He will not forsake him in another; when (idh substitutes for the previous idh) the two were in the cave -- a breach in the mountain called Thawr -- when (idh substituting again), he said to his companion, Ab Bakr -- who, upon perceiving the [sound of the] feet of the idolaters [nearby], had said to him, \u0060If one of them should merely look below his feet, he will definitely see us!\u0027 -- \u0060Do not despair; verily God is with us\u0027, assisting [us]. Then God sent down His Spirit of Peace upon him, His reassurance -- some say this means upon the Prophet, others, that it means upon Ab Bakr -- and supported him, that is, the Prophet (s), with legions, of angels, you did not see, [both] in the cave and in the locations in which he fought battles; and He made the word of those who disbelieved, that is, the call to idolatry, the nethermost, the one vanquished, and the Word of God, that is, the profession of His Oneness (shahda), was the uppermost, the one prevailing and triumphant. And God is Mighty, in His Kingdom, Wise, in His actions.",
  "Go forth, light and heavy!, that is, energetically or not; it is also said [to mean], [go forth] strong or weak, or rich or poor -- but this was abrogated by the verse, The weak would not be at fault ... [Q. 9:91]. Struggle in the way of God with your possessions and your lives: that is better for you, if only you knew, that it is better for you; so do not sink down heavily.",
  "The following was revealed regarding the hypocrites who stayed behind [away from the campaign]: Had it -- that to which you summon them -- been a near, easily acquired, gain, a transient pleasure of this world, and an easy journey, of moderate [length], they would have followed you, seeking spoils; but the distance, the hardship, was too great for them, and so they stayed behind. Still they will swear by God, when you return to them: [saying]: \u0060Had we been able, to go forth, we would have gone forth with you,\u0027 destroying their souls, by swearing false oaths, and God knows that they truly are liars, in this saying of theirs.",
  "The Prophet (s), exercising his personal judgement, had given leave to a group to stay behind, and so the following was revealed as a reprimand for him, but with the pardon first, in order to reassure his heart: May God pardon you! Why do you give them leave, to stay behind; why did you not leave them, until it was clear to you which of them spoke the truth, in their excuse, and you knew those who were lying, in it?",
  "Those who believe in God and the Last Day do not ask leave of you, to stay behind, that they may struggle with their possessions and their lives; and God knows the pious.",
  "They alone ask leave of you, to stay behind, who do not believe in God and the Last Day, and whose hearts are doubtful, uncertain, about religion, so in their doubt they waver, they are confused.",
  "If they had desired to go forth, with you, they would have made some preparation for it, some equipment, such as tools and provisions, but God was averse that they should be sent forth, that is, He did not want them to go forth, so He slowed them down, He made them [feel] lethargic, and it was said, to them: \u0060Stay back with those who stay back!\u0027, [with] the sick, the women and the children: in other words, God decreed this.",
  "Had they gone forth among you, they would only have caused you more trouble, [more] corruption, by abandoning the believers, and would have hurried to and fro among you, that is, they would have hastened to spread slander among you, seeking, desiring, to stir up sedition, by casting enmity, between you; and among you there are some who would listen to them, to what they say, listening in readiness to accept it; and God knows the evildoers.",
  "Indeed, they sought to stir up sedition, against you, already before, when you first came to Medina, and scrutinised your affairs, that is, they thought long and hard how to plot against you and invalidate your religion, until the truth, the [victorious] help, came, and God\u0027s command, His religion, prevailed, stood mighty, they still being averse, to it [His religion], entering it superficially.",
  "And there are some of them who say, \u0060Grant me leave, to stay behind, and do not lead me into temptation\u0027: this was al-Jadd b. Qays, to whom the Prophet (s) said, \u0060Will you do battle against the Byzantines?\u0027, and to which he replied, \u0060I am infatuated with women, and I fear that if I were to see these Byzantine women, I shall not be able to stay away from them and be led into temptation\u0027. God, exalted be He, says: Surely they have [already] fallen into temptation!, by staying behind (a variant reading [for saqat, \u0060they have fallen\u0027] has [the singular form] saqat, \u0060he has fallen\u0027). And surely Hell shall encompass the disbelievers, for whom there shall be no escape therefrom.",
  "If good fortune, such as a victory or [a taking of] some spoils, befalls you, it vexes them; but if an affliction, some hardship, befalls you, they say, \u0060We took our precaution, judiciously -- when we stayed behind -- before\u0027, before this act of disobedience; and they turn away, rejoicing, at what has afflicted you.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Nothing shall afflict us but that which God has decreed for us, that we be afflicted thereby; He is our Protector, our Helper and the One in charge of our affairs; in God let the believers put their trust\u0027.",
  "Say: \u0060Are you waiting (tarabbasn: one of the two original t\u0027 letters [in tatarabbasn] has been omitted) for anything, to occur, for us but one of the two fair things, [the two fair] outcomes? (husnayayn is the dual form of husn, which is the feminine form of ahsan), that is, victory or martyrdom? We are waiting in your case too, for God to afflict you with a chastisement from Him, with a calamity from the heaven, or at our hands, should we be given permission to fight you. So wait, for this to [befall] us, we are also waiting with you\u0027, your end.",
  "Say: \u0060Expend, in obedience to God, willingly or unwillingly, it, what you expend, shall not be accepted from you; you are surely a wicked folk\u0027 (the imperative statement here [also] functions as a predicate).",
  "And nothing prevents their expenditure from being accepted (read as yuqbala or tuqbala) from them, but that they (innahum is the subject of the verb, while an tuqbala, \u0060being accepted\u0027 constitutes the object) have disbelieved in God and His Messenger, and that they do not come to [perform] prayer save as idlers, sluggishly, and that they do not expend without their being reluctant, to expend, for they consider it a financial penalty.",
  "So do not let their wealth or their children please you, that is, do not deem fair Our graces to them, for this is a [way of] drawing [them] on by degrees [to punish them]: God only desires thereby to chastise them in the life of this world, by way of the hardship that they encounter in amassing such [wealth and children] and the calamities [they suffer] as a result thereof; and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers, so He punishes them in the Hereafter with the worst punishment.",
  "And they swear by God that they truly are of you, that is, [that they are] believers; but they are not of you; they are a folk who are afraid, that you should deal with them as you have done with the idolaters, and so they swear merely in pretence, in order to protect themselves.",
  "If they could find a shelter, in which to seek refuge, or some caverns, underground chambers, or any place to enter, they would turn and bolt away to it, they would hasten to enter it and get away from you with the undeterred speed of an indomitable steed.",
  "Some of them defame you concerning the, apportioning of, voluntary almsgivings; if they are given a share of them, they are content, but if they are given none then they are enraged.",
  "If only they had been content with what God and His Messenger have given them, in the way of spoils and the like, and had said, \u0060Sufficient for us is God; God will give us from His bounty, and His Messenger [will also give us], from other spoils, what will suffice us; to God we are suppliants\u0027, that He enrich us (the response of [the conditional] law, \u0060if only\u0027, is la-kna khayran lahum, \u0060it would have been better for them\u0027).",
  "The voluntary almsgivings, the alms to be dispensed, are only for the poor, who cannot find anything to suffice them in the least, and the needy, who cannot find anything to suffice them, and those who work with them, that is, [with] these alms, in other words, the one who collects [them], the one who takes the oaths [from those who claim them], the slave to be manumitted by contract, as well as the tax-summoner; and those whose hearts are to be reconciled, so that they might become Muslims, or that Islam might be firmly established, or that their peers might become Muslims, or that they might defend Muslims, all of whom are [classed according to different] categories. According to al-Shfi\u0060, may God be pleased with him, the first and the last [of these categories] are no longer given [of the alms-tax] today, because of the [established] power of Islam; in contrast, the other two [categories] are given [of the alms-tax], according to the sounder [opinion]; and for, the manumission of, slaves, that is, [for] slaves to be manumitted by contract, and for the debtors, those in debt, if they have taken out a debt without intending thereby an act of disobedience, or those who have repented but have nothing with which to fulfil [the penalty of expiation], or to set things right between people, even if they be wealthy; and, for the way of God, that is, [for] those who are engaged in the struggle, of those for whom there is no [share of the] booty (fay\u0027), even if they be wealthy; and for the traveller, the one cut off [from resources] during his journey -- a duty imposed by God (fardatan, \u0060a duty\u0027, is in the accusative because of an implied verb [sc. faradah, \u0060which He has imposed\u0027]). And God is Knower, of His creatures, Wise, in His actions. Thus, it is impermissible to dispense these [alms-proceeds] other than to these [categories], or to deny [these proceeds to] any one of these [categories] if they exist. The Imam must divide these [proceeds] among them equally, but he is permitted to give priority to certain individuals over others within any one category. The lm [of li\u0027l-fuqar\u0027, \u0060for the poor\u0027] indicates that it is obligatory to include every individual [of these categories in the distribution of the proceeds]; it is not, however, obligatory [to do so] when the person in charge of the monies has to apportion it but [finds that] it is insufficient. Indeed [in such a situation] it suffices to give three individuals from each category, but anything less than that is not sufficient, as is indicated by the plural form. The Sunna shows that the prerequisite condition for receiving [a share] of such [monies] is that the person be a Muslim, but not a Hashim or a Muttlib.",
  "And of them, the hypocrites, are those who injure the Prophet, by casting aspersions on him and communicating [to others] what he says [in confidence], saying, when they are forbidden from [doing] this, lest it should reach him: \u0060He is only a listener!\u0027, that is, he listens to anything that is said, and accepts it, so that when we swear to him that we have not communicated [to others] a particular thing, he believes us. Say, he is, \u0060A listener, who listens, to good for you, and not one who listens to evil, one who believes in God and has faith, he trusts, in the believers, in what they inform him, and not in others (the lm [of li\u0027l- mu\u0027minna, \u0060in the believers\u0027] has been added to distinguish between belief in the sense of \u0060submitting [to God]\u0027 (islm), and in other senses [such as \u0060trusting\u0027]) and who is a mercy (read rahmatun, in the nominative, as a supplement to udhunun, \u0060a listener\u0027, or rahmatin, in the genitive, as a supplement to khayrin, \u0060to good\u0027) to those of you who believe. Those who injure God\u0027s Messenger, for them there is a painful chastisement\u0027.",
  "They swear by God to you, O believers, that what has reached you of the Messenger being injured they did not do, so that they might please you, but God and His Messenger are more deserving that they should please them, through obedience, if they are, true, believers (the merging of the pronouns into one [in yurdhu, \u0060their pleasing them\u0027] is because the \u0060pleasure\u0027 of both [God and His Messenger] are mutually dependent; [either that] or it is because the predicate of Allhu wa-rasluhu, \u0060God and His Messenger\u0027, has been omitted).",
  "Do they not know that, the fact is that, whoever opposes God and His Messenger, for him shall be the fire of Hell, as a requital, to abide therein? That is the great abasement.",
  "The hypocrites are cautious, they fear, lest a sra should be revealed to them, that is, [to] the believers, informing them of what is in their [the hypocrites\u0027] hearts, of hypocrisy, and yet despite this they persist in mockery. Say: \u0060Keep mocking! (this is an imperative of threat) God will bring out, He will make manifest, that, hypocrisy of yours, of which you are fearful\u0027, lest it be brought out.",
  "And if (la-in: the lm is for oaths) you question them, about their mockery of you and of the Qur\u0027n while they were journeying with you towards Tabk, assuredly they will say, making excuses: \u0060We were only engaging [in idle talk] and jesting\u0027, in conversation, in order to pass [the time of] the road, and we did not mean it. Say, to them: \u0060Were you then mocking God, and His signs, and His Messenger?",
  "Make no excuses, for that. You have disbelieved after believing, that is, your disbelief has become manifest even as you have manifested belief. If We forgive (read passive yu\u0060fa, \u0060it is forgiven\u0027, or active [first person plural] na\u0060fu, \u0060We forgive\u0027) a party of you, because of its sincerity and its repentance, as in the case of Jahsh b. Humayyir, We will chastise (read either [passive] tu\u0060adhdhab, \u0060[it] shall be chastised\u0027, or nu\u0060adhdhib) another party because they were sinners\u0027, persisting in hypocrisy and mockery.",
  "The hypocrites, both men and women, are of one another, that is, they resemble one another in religion, as pieces of an individual entity, they enjoin indecency, unbelief and acts of disobedience, and forbid decency, faith and obedience; and they withhold their hands shut, from expending in obedience [of God]; they have forgotten God, they have abandoned obedience of Him, so He has forgotten them, He has deprived them of His grace. Truly the hypocrites, they are the wicked.",
  "God has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers, the fire of Hell, to abide therein: it will suffice them, as a requital and a punishment. And God has cursed them, He has removed them from His mercy, and theirs will be a lasting, perpetual, chastisement.",
  "You, O hypocrites, are, like those before you, who were far mightier than you, and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share, their lot in this world. So you enjoy, O hypocrites, your share, just as those before you enjoyed their share, and you indulge [in vain talk], in falsehood and defamation of the Prophet (s), just as they indulged [in vain talk]. Those, their works have become invalid in this world and in the Hereafter; and those, they indeed are the losers.",
  "Has not the tidings, the tale, of those before them reached them -- the folk of Noah, and \u0060d, the folk of Hd, and Thamd, the folk of Slih, and the folk of Abraham, and the dwellers of Midian, the folk of Shu\u0060ayb, and the Deviant [cities]?, the cities of the folk of Lot, meaning, its inhabitants. Their messengers brought them clear proofs, with miracles, but they denied them, and so were destroyed. God would never have wronged them, by punishing them for no sin [on their part], but they wronged themselves, by committing sin.",
  "And the believers, both men and women, are allies of one another; they enjoin decency and forbid indecency; they observe prayer and pay the alms, and they obey God and His Messenger. Those, God will have mercy on them. Truly God is Mighty, nothing can prevent Him from fulfilling His promise and His threat; Wise, He puts everything in its proper place.",
  "God has promised the believers, both men and women, Gardens underneath which rivers flow, to abide therein, and blessed dwellings in the Gardens of Eden, for residence, and beatitude from God is greater, is superior to all of that. That is the supreme triumph.",
  "O Prophet, struggle against the disbelievers, with the sword, and the hypocrites, with words and [definitive] arguments, and be harsh with them, through rebuke and aversion [towards them]; for their abode will be Hell, an evil journey\u0027s end, [an evil] resort it is!",
  "They, the hypocrites, swear by God that they said nothing, of the defamation that has reached you [as being] from them; but they did indeed say the word of disbelief and did disbelieve after their submission [to God]: they did indeed manifest disbelief after having manifested submission [to God]. And they purposed that which they never attained, in the way of assassinating the Prophet on the night of al-\u0060Aqaba, upon his return from Tabk -- there were about ten to twenty of them, and \u0060Ammr b. Ysir struck the faces of their riding camels when they came against him and were thus repulsed; and they were only spiteful, they detested, that God and His Messenger should have enriched them of His bounty, by way of spoils, when they had been in dire need: the meaning is that this was all that they attained from him, which is nothing to be spiteful about. So if they repent, of hypocrisy and believe in you, it will be better for them; but if they turn away, from belief, God will chastise them with a painful chastisement in this world, by having them killed, and in the Hereafter, in the Fire, and they have none on earth as protector, to guard them from Him, or helper, to defend them.",
  "And some of them have made a covenant with God [saying]: \u0060If He gives us of His bounty, we will give voluntary alms (la-nassaddaqanna: the original t\u0027 [of natasaddaqanna] has been assimilated with the sd) and become of the righteous\u0027: this was Tha\u0060laba b. Htib, who asked the Prophet (s) to supplicate on his behalf so that God would give him wealth, of which he would give every needy person his due. He [the Prophet] thus supplicated for him and he became wealthy, but stopped attending the Friday prayer and congregational prayers and refused to pay the alms-tax, as God, exalted be He, says:",
  "Yet when He gave them of His bounty, they became niggardly with it and turned away, from obedience to God, in aversion.",
  "So He made the consequence in their case hypocrisy, fixed, in their hearts, until the day they meet Him, that is, God, on the Day of Resurrection, because they failed God in what they promised Him and because, of that concerning which, they lied: he [Tha\u0060laba] then brought [the payment of] his alms to the Prophet (s), who said to him, \u0060God has forbidden me to accept [it] from you\u0027; so he [Tha\u0060laba] began to throw earth on his head [in remorse]. He then approached Ab Bakr with it, who did not accept it. He then went to \u0060Umar [b. al-Khattb], who also did not accept it. He went to \u0060Uthmn [b. \u0060Affn], but he did not accept it; he died during the latter\u0027s reign.",
  "Did they, the hypocrites, not know that God knows their secret, what they conceal within themselves, and their confidential talks, what they confide in each other, and that God is the Knower of the hidden things?, what is concealed from the eyes.",
  "When the verse concerning \u0060voluntary alms\u0027 [Q. 9:75] was revealed, a man came and gave a large amount as voluntary alms, so the hypocrites said, \u0060He is [merely] showing off!\u0027 Another man then came and gave a [moderate] measure [of food], and so they said, \u0060God has no need of this man\u0027s charity!\u0027 The following was then revealed: Those who (alladhna is the subject) find fault with, defame, the believers who offer alms voluntarily, performing supererogation, and such as find nothing [to offer] but their endeavours, [nothing but] what they are capable of, and offer it; and deride them (and the predicate [of the mentioned subject] is [the following]) -- God [Himself] derides them, He has requited them for their derision, and theirs will be a painful chastisement.",
  "Ask forgiveness for them, O Muhammad (s), or do not ask forgiveness for them: this leaves the choice of asking forgiveness, or refraining, up to him; the Prophet (s) said, \u0060I have been given the choice, and I made it\u0027, meaning [the choice] to ask forgiveness, as reported by al-Bukhr. If you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, God will not forgive them: it is said that the \u0060seventy\u0027 is intended to express [by hyperbole] a great frequency of asking forgiveness. In [the Sahh of] al-Bukhr there is a hadth [which states]: \u0060If I was sure that were I to ask more than seventy times, God would forgive [them], I would have done so\u0027. It is also said, however, that the very number [seventy] is actually meant, on account of this other hadth of his: \u0060I shall ask more than seventy times\u0027, whereupon it was made clear to him [the Prophet] that the matter regarding forgiveness had been concluded by the verse, [Q. 63:6] Alike it will be regarding them: whether you ask forgiveness for them or you do not ask forgiveness for them [God will not forgive them]; that is because they disbelieved in God and His Messenger; and God does not guide the wicked folk.",
  "Those who were left behind, from [the journey to] Tabk, rejoiced at remaining behind the Messenger of God, and were averse to striving with their wealth and their lives in the way of God. And they said, that is, they said to one another, \u0060Do not go forth, do not set off to [join] the fight, in the heat!\u0027 Say: \u0060The fire of Hell is hotter, than Tabk, and more worthy for them to guard against, by not staying behind, did they but understand\u0027, this, they would not have stayed behind.",
  "But let them laugh a little, in this world, and weep much, in the Hereafter, as a requital for what they used to earn (the sentence is predicative of their state, expressed in the form of an imperative).",
  "So if God brings you back, from Tabk, to a party of them, of those hypocrites who stayed behind in Medina, and they ask leave of you to go forth, with you on some other campaign, say, to them: \u0060You shall never more go forth with me, and you shall never fight with me against an enemy. You were content to stay behind the first time, so stay behind with those who stay behind\u0027, away from [military] campaigns, such as women and children and others.",
  "When the Prophet (s) prayed over [the dead body of \u0060Abd Allh] Ibn Ubayy, the following was revealed: And never pray over any one of them when he is dead, nor stand over his grave, at a burial or as a visit; lo! they disbelieved in God and His Messenger, and died while they were wicked, [they died] disbelieving.",
  "And let not their wealth and their children please you; God desires only to chastise them thereby in this world, and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers.",
  "And when a sra, that is, a section of the Qur\u0027n, is revealed, saying: \u0060Believe in God and strive with His Messenger\u0027, the affluent among them ask leave of you, saying, \u0060Leave us to be with those who sit at home\u0027.",
  "They are content to be with those who stay behind (khawlif is the plural of khlifa, meaning the women who \u0060stay behind\u0027 [takhallafna] at home) and a seal has been set upon their hearts, so they do not understand, [what is] good.",
  "But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth and their lives: for them are the good things, in this life and in the Hereafter; those, they are the successful, the triumphant.",
  "God has prepared for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow, to abide therein: that is the supreme triumph.",
  "And those Bedouins who had an excuse (al-mu\u0060adhdhirn: the original t\u0027 has been assimilated with the dl, in other words [it would usually be read as] al-mu\u0060tadhirn, which [itself] is a variant reading), those [of them who were] excused, [came] to the Prophet (s), asking for leave, to stay behind on account of their excuses, and so he gave them leave to do so. And those who lied to God and His Messenger, by feigning belief, [those] hypocrites among the Bedouin, stayed behind, [refraining] from coming to give [their] excuses -- a painful chastisement shall befall those of them who disbelieve.",
  "As for the weak, such as the old, and the sick, the blind and the chronically ill, and those who find nothing to expend, for the struggle, no blame, no sin, falls upon them, should they stay away from it, if they remain true to God and to His Messenger, when they stay behind, by not spreading false rumours or impeding [others from joining the struggle], but by [adhering to] obedience. There is no way [of blame], no way of reproach, against those who are virtuous, through such [behaviour]. And God is Forgiving, Merciful, to them, by granting them such leeway [in this matter].",
  "Nor against those who, when they came to you so that you might give them a mount, [to ride] with you on the raid -- these were seven men of the Ansr; but it is also said that they were the Ban Muqrin -- you having said to them, \u0060I cannot find [a mount] whereon to mount you\u0027 (this [last sentence] is a circumstantial qualifier), turned back (this is the response to the [clause beginning with] idh, \u0060when\u0027), that is, they departed, their eyes flowing, pouring, with tears (min al-dam\u0060i: min is explicative) for sorrow that they could not find the means to expend, for the [campaign] struggle.",
  "The way [of blame] is only against those who ask leave of you, to stay behind, when they are rich. They are content to be with those who stay behind and God has set a seal on their hearts, so that they do not know: a similar statement has already been made.",
  "They will make excuses to you, for having stayed behind, when you return to them, from the campaign. Say, to them: \u0060Do not make excuses; we will never believe you! God has already told us tidings of you, that is, He has already informed us of your [true] status. And God will see your work, and [so will] His Messenger, then you will be returned, through resurrection, to the Knower of the unseen and the visible, meaning [to] God, and He will tell you what you used to do\u0027, and requite you for it.",
  "They will swear to you by God, when you turn back, [when] you return, to them, from Tabk, that they had [genuine] excuses for staying behind, so that you may leave them be, refraining from reproaching them. So leave them be, for they are an abomination, filth, on account of their inner vileness, and their abode shall be Hell, as requital for what they used to earn.",
  "They will swear to you, that you may be satisfied with them; but if you are satisfied with them, God will surely not be satisfied with the wicked folk, that is, with them: your satisfaction is of no avail in the face of the wrath of God.",
  "The Bedouins, the [Arab] nomads, are more intense in unbelief and hypocrisy, than the city-dwellers, on account of their harshness and crude nature and their being too remote to hear the Qur\u0027n, and are more likely not to know the bounds of what God has revealed to His Messenger, in the way of rulings and [legal] prescriptions; and God is Knower, of His creatures, Wise, in what He does with them.",
  "And of the Bedouins there is he who takes what he expends, in the way of God, as a penalty, as a liability and a [financial] loss, because he does not aspire to be rewarded for it, but expends it out of fear: these were Ban Asad and [Ban] Ghatafn; and awaits for you [evil] turns of fortune, the fortunes of time, for you, that these should turn against you, and so be rid [of you]. Theirs shall be the evil (read as al-s\u0060, or al- saw\u0060) turn of fortune, that is, chastisement and destruction shall turn on them, not on you. And God is Hearer, of the sayings of His servants, Knower, of their actions.",
  "And of the Bedouins there is he who believes in God and the Last Day, such as [men from among the tribes of] Juhayna and Muzayna, and takes what he expends, in the way of God, as [pious] offerings to bring [him] nearer to God, and, as a means, to [secure] the prayers, the supplications, of the Messenger, for him. Surely these, the expenditure of such [men], will bring them nearer (read qurubatun or qurbatun), to Him. God will admit them into His mercy, His Paradise. Truly God is Forgiving, to those who obey Him, Merciful, to them.",
  "And the first to lead the way, of the Emigrants and the Helpers, namely, those who were present at [the battle of] Badr, or [it means] all the Companions, and those who follow them, up to the Day of Resurrection, by being virtuous, in deeds, God will be pleased with them, for their obedience of Him, and they will be pleased with Him, for His reward [to them]; and He has prepared for them Gardens -- with rivers flowing beneath them (a variant reading adds min [min tahtih, \u0060beneath which\u0027]) -- to abide therein forever: that is the supreme triumph.",
  "And among those around you, O inhabitants of Medina, of the Bedouins there are hypocrites, such as [the tribes of] Aslam, Ashja\u0060 and Ghifr, and among the townspeople of Medina, there are also hypocrites, who are obstinate in hypocrisy, engrossed in it and persisting [in it]. You do not know them -- an address to the Prophet (s) -- but We know them, and We shall chastise them twice, by disgracing them or having them killed in this world, and by way of punishment in the grave, then they will be returned, in the Hereafter, to a terrible chastisement, namely, the Fire.",
  "And [there are] others (kharn is the subject), [another] folk, who have confessed their sins, for having stayed behind (i\u0060taraf bi-dhunbihim is an adjectival qualification of it [the subject] and the predicate is [the following, khalat \u0060amalan slihan]) they have mixed a righteous deed, that is, their former [participation in the] struggle, or the their confession of their sins, or otherwise, with another that was bad, which is their having stayed behind. It may be that God will relent to them. Truly God is Forgiving, Merciful: this was revealed regarding Ab Lubba and a group of men who tied themselves to the walls of the mosque after they heard what had been revealed regarding those who stayed behind; they swore that only the Prophet (s) would untie them, which he did when this [verse] was revealed.",
  "Take of their wealth some alms, to purify them and to cleanse them thereby, of their sins; he thus took a third of their wealth and gave it away as charity; and pray for them, that is, supplicate for them; truly your prayers are a comfort, a mercy, for them: it is also said [to mean] reassurance [for them], that their repentance has been accepted. And God is Hearer, Knower.",
  "Do they not know that God is He Who accepts repentance from His servants and takes, accepts, the voluntary alms, and that God is He Who is the Relenting, to His servants, by accepting their repentance, and the Merciful?, to them (the interrogative is intended as an affirmative [statement] and is meant to incite them to [offer] repentance and charity).",
  "And say, to them, or to people [in general]: \u0060Act, as you will, for God will surely see your actions, and [so will] His Messenger and the believers, and you will be returned, through resurrection, to the Knower of the unseen and the visible, that is, [to] God, and He will tell you what you used to do\u0027, and so requite you for it.",
  "And [there are] others, from among those who stayed behind, who are deferred (read murja\u0027na or murjawna), whose repentance is delayed, to God\u0027s command, concerning them, according to His will, whether He chastises them, by causing them to die without [their having made any] repentance, or relents to them; and God is Knower, of His creatures, Wise, in what He does with them. These [others mentioned] are the three, who will be mentioned afterwards: Murra b. al-Rab\u0060, Ka\u0060b b. Mlik and Hill b. Umayya. They stayed behind out of laziness and their inclination for peace and quiet, not out of hypocrisy. Unlike the others, however, they did not excuse themselves before the Prophet (s), and so the matter regarding them was suspended for fifty days, during which time people avoided them, until it was later revealed that God had relented to them.",
  "And, among them, those who have chosen a mosque -- these were twelve men from among the hypocrites -- by way of harm, to cause distress for those of the mosque of Qub\u0027, and disbelief, since they built it on the orders of the monk Ab \u0060mir, as a sanctuary for him, so that whoever comes from his side may stay there: he had gone to the Byzantine Emperor (qaysar) to bring troops to fight against the Prophet (s), and to cause division among the believers, who pray in the mosque of Qub\u0027, by having some of these pray in their [the hypocrites\u0027] mosque, and as an outpost, an observation post, for those who waged war against God and His Messenger before, that is, before it was built -- meaning the above-mentioned Ab \u0060mir -- they will swear: \u0060We desired nothing, by building it, but, to do, good\u0027, by way of kindness towards the poor in times of [heavy] rain or [extreme] heat and in order to provide [a place of worship] for the Muslims; and God bears witness that they are truly liars, in this [claim of theirs]. They had asked the Prophet (s) to perform prayers in it, and so the following was revealed:",
  "Never stand, [never] perform prayer, there: and so he sent a group of men to destroy and burn it, and in its place they left a refuse pit where decaying cadavers would be dumped. A mosque which was founded, one whose foundations were built, upon piety from the first day, constructed the day you arrived in Medina (dr al-hijra) -- this was the mosque of Qub\u0027, as mentioned in Bukhr -- is worthier, than that [other one], for you to stand, to perform prayer, therein; in it are men, namely, the Ansr, who love to purify themselves; and God loves those who purify themselves (muttahhirn: the original t\u0027 [of mutatahhirn] has been assimilated with the t\u0027) that is, He will reward them. Ibn Khuzayma reported in his Sahh [by way of an isnd] from [\u0060Uwaym] b. S\u0060ida that: \u0060The Prophet (s) came to them at the mosque of Qub\u0027 and said, \u0022God, exalted be He, has praised handsomely the way you purify yourselves in the story about your mosque, so what is this purification which you perform?\u0022 They said, \u0022By God, O Messenger of God, all that we know is that we used to have Jews in our vicinity and they used to wash their behinds after defecation, and so we began to wash in the way they did\u0022\u0027. According to one hadth reported by al-Bazzr [they said]: \u0060We use stones [to scrape off remnants] and follow this with water\u0027; to which he [the Prophet] said, \u0060That is the way [for proper purification]. Let this be your way\u0027.",
  "Is he who founded his building upon fear of God and, in hope of, beatitude, from Him, better, or he who founded his building upon the brink, the edge, of a bank, an overhang, that is crumbling, about to collapse (read juruf or jurf) so that it toppled with him, so that it collapsed [taking] with it the one who built it, into the fire of Hell?: [this is] an excellent similitude for building upon that which constitutes the opposite of fear of God and [for] what it leads to; the interrogative is meant as an affirmative: in other words, the former is the better, which is the likeness of the [building of the] mosque of Qub\u0027, while the latter is the likeness of the mosque of \u0060harm\u0027 (masjid al-dirr). And God guides not the evildoing folk.",
  "The buildings which they have built will never cease to be a misgiving, a point of doubt, in their hearts unless their hearts are cut, torn, to pieces, such that they die; and God is Knower, of His creatures, Wise, in what He does with them.",
  "Indeed God has purchased from the believers their lives and their possessions, that they expend it in obedience of Him -- for example by striving in His way -- so that theirs will be [the reward of] Paradise: they shall fight in the way of God and they shall kill and be killed (this sentence is independent and constitutes an explication of the [above-mentioned] \u0060purchase\u0027; a variant reading has the passive verb come first [sc. fa-yuqtalna wa-yaqtuln, \u0060they shall be killed and shall kill\u0027], meaning that some of them are killed while those who remain, fight on); that is a promise which is binding (both [wa\u0060dan, \u0060promise\u0027, and haqqan, \u0060binding\u0027] are verbal nouns, and are in the accusative on account of their omitted [implicit] verbs) upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur\u0027n; and who fulfils his covenant better than God?, that is, no one is better in fulfilling it. Rejoice then (there is a shift from the third [to second] person here) in this bargain of yours which you have made, for that, bargain, is the supreme triumph, the one that secures the ultimate goal.",
  "Those who repent (al-t\u0027ibna is in the nominative as a laudative, the subject being implicit), from idolatry and hypocrisy, those who worship, who devote their worship sincerely to God, those who give praise, to Him in every state, those who fast, those who bow, those who prostrate themselves, that is, those who perform prayers, those who enjoin decency and forbid to indecency, those who maintain God\u0027s bounds, His rulings, by implementing them, and give good tidings to the believers, of Paradise.",
  "The following was revealed regarding the Prophet (s) asking forgiveness for his uncle Ab Tlib, and some of the Companions asking forgiveness for their idolatrous parents: It is not for the Prophet, and those who believe, to ask forgiveness for the idolaters, even though they be kinsmen, relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are inhabitants of the Hell-fire, for having died as disbelievers.",
  "Abraham\u0027s prayer for the forgiveness of his father was only because of a promise he had made to him, when he said to him, I will ask my Lord forgiveness for you [Q. 19:47], in the hope that he would submit [to God]; but when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of God, upon his death as an disbeliever, he declared himself innocent of him, and refrained from asking forgiveness for him; truly Abraham was soft of heart, making frequent entreaty and supplication [to God], forbearing, enduring harm patiently.",
  "And God would never send a people astray after He had guided them, to Islam, until He had made clear to them that which they should be wary of, in the way of deeds, but when they are not wary of it, then they deserve to be sent astray. Surely God is Knower of all things, including who deserves to be sent astray, or to be guided.",
  "Surely to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth. He gives life and He makes to die; and you do not have, O mankind, besides God, that is, other than Him, any protector, to preserve you from Him, or helper, to defend you against His hurt.",
  "God has truly relented, that is, He has [truly] perpetuated His relenting, to the Prophet and the Emigrants and the Helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship, that is, during the time of this [hardship], which was their predicament during the raid at Tabk, where two men would share a single date, ten men would take turns on one camel, and where the heat became so intense that they resorted to drinking filth; after the hearts of a party of them had almost deviated (read either as tazghu or yazghu), [had almost] inclined away from following him, in favour of staying behind due to the hardship that afflicted them, then He relented to them, by making them steadfast. Truly He is Gentle, Merciful to them.",
  "And, He relented, to the three who were left behind, [formerly denied] His relenting to them, for the same reason [as those mentioned above], when the earth was straitened for them, for all its breadth, that is, despite its vastness, so they could find no place wherein to feel secure, and their souls, that is, their hearts, were straitened for them, because of the anxiety and their [sense of] alienation resulting from the delay of God\u0027s relenting to them [with mercy], such that they [their souls] could not find happiness or solace; until they thought, they were certain, that (read the softened an) there is no refuge from God except in Him. Then He turned [relenting] to them, He made them successful in finding repentance, that they might also turn [in repentance]. Truly God is the Relenting, the Merciful.",
  "O you who believe, fear God, by refraining from [acts of] disobedience to Him, and be with those who are truthful, in [their] faith and covenants, by adhering to sincerity.",
  "It is not for the people of Medina and for the Bedouins [who dwell] around them to stay behind God\u0027s Messenger, when he sets out on a campaign, and to prefer their lives to his life, by guarding them against hardships which he [the Prophet] is content [to suffer] himself (this statement is a prohibition expressed as a predicate); that, prohibition against staying behind, is because neither thirst nor toil nor hunger afflicts them in the way of God, nor tread they any tread (mawti\u0027an is a verbal noun, meaning wat\u0027an) that enrages the disbelievers, nor gain any gain from the enemy, of God, be it through slaughter, capture or plunder, but a righteous deed is therefore recorded for them, that they may be rewarded for it. Truly God does not leave the wage of the virtuous to go to waste, that is, the wage of those [mentioned], rather He rewards them.",
  "Nor expend they, therein [in the way of God], any sum, small, even if it be a single date, or great, nor do they cross a valley, during a [campaign] march, but it is recorded for them, as a righteous deed, that God may reward them the best of what they used to do, that is, the [due] reward thereof.",
  "When the Prophet (s) was about to dispatch a raiding party -- after they [certain Muslims] had been reproached for staying behind -- all of them went forth, and so the following was revealed: It is not for the believers to go forth, on a raid, altogether: why should not a party, a group, of every section, of every tribe, of them go forth, while the others remain behind, so that they, those who remain behind, may become learned in religion and that they may warn their folk when they return to them, from the raid, by teaching them some of the rulings which they have come to learn, so that they may beware? of God\u0027s punishment, by adhering to His commands and prohibitions. Ibn \u0060Abbs said that this [verse] is specifically [intended] for raiding parties, while the previous one is [specifically] to prohibit any individual staying behind when the Prophet (s) sets out [on a campaign].",
  "O you who believe, fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you, that is, the nearest, followed by the next nearest of them, and let them find harshness in you, that is, severity, in other words, be harsh with them, and know that God is with the pious, helping and granting [them] victory.",
  "And whenever a sra, of the Qur\u0027n, is revealed, there are some of them, that is, the hypocrites, who say, to their companions, mockingly: \u0060Which of you has this increased in faith?\u0027, and God says: As for those who believe, it has increased them in faith, because they accept that it is true, and they rejoice, because of it.",
  "But as for those in whose hearts is sickness, a weakness of faith, it only adds abomination to their abomination, that is, [it only adds] disbelief to their disbelief, since they disbelieve in it, and they die while they were disbelievers.",
  "Do they not see, that is, the hypocrites ([in which case] read a-wa-l yarawna; or if read a-wa-l tarawna, \u0060do you, O believers, not see\u0027) that they are tested, afflicted, every year once or twice?, with drought and diseases. Still they do not repent, of their hypocrisy, nor do they remember, [nor] do they heed admonition.",
  "And whenever a sra is revealed, wherein is mention of them, and the Prophet (s) recites it, they look at one another, desiring to flee, and saying: \u0060Will anyone see you?\u0027, if you get up [and flee]?, and so if no one can see them they get up [and leave], otherwise they stay put. Then they turn away, persisting in their disbelief. God turns their hearts away, from guidance, because they are a folk who do not understand, the truth, for they do not reflect [on it].",
  "Verily there has come to you a messenger from among yourselves, that is, one of you -- Muhammad (s) -- for whom it is grievous, hard, that you should suffer, that is, your suffering, your experiencing hardship and encountering harm [is hard on him]; who is full of concern for you, that you should be rightly guided; to the believers full of pity, profoundly compassionate, merciful, desiring good for them.",
  "So if they turn away, [refraining] from believing in you, say: \u0060God suffices me. There is no god except Him. Upon Him I rely, in Him have I put my trust, and in none other, and He is the Lord of the Tremendous Throne\u0027 (al-\u0060arsh al-azm), the kurs, which is singled out for mention because it is the greatest of all things created. Al-Hkim reported in al-Mustadrak [by way of an isnd] from Ubayy b. Ka\u0060b that he [Ubayy] said: \u0060The last verse to be revealed was [from], Verily there has come to you a messenger... to the end of the sra\u0027 [sc. Q. 9:128-129]. Meccan, except for verses 40, 94, 95 and 96, which are Medinese; it consists of 109 or 110 verses, and was revealed after [srat] al-Isr\u0027.",
  "Alif lm r\u0027: God knows best what He means by these [letters]. Those, namely, these signs, are the signs of the wise Book, that is, the Qur\u0027n (the genitive annexation [yt al-kitb] has the meaning of min [sc. min yti\u0027l-kitb, \u0060from among the verses of the Book\u0027]), which has been made clear.",
  "Is it for the people, the people of Mecca (this interrogative is meant as a disavowal; the preposition [li-, \u0060for\u0027] and its dependent genitive noun [al-ns, \u0060the people\u0027] constitute a circumstantial qualifier of His saying): a wonder (\u0060ajaban: read in the accusative as a predicate of kna; or if read in the nominative [\u0060ajabun] as its subject: its predicate, which is also its subject if read according to the former [accusative] reading, is [the following, an awhayn]) that We have inspired a man from among them, Muhammad (s), [saying] (an, \u0060that\u0027, is explicative): \u0060Warn, threaten, the people, the disbelievers, with chastisement, and give good tidings to those who believe that they have a prior, a preceding, [promise of] truth with their Lord\u0027?, that is a [preceding] fair reward, in return for the deeds they have sent forward. The disbelievers say, \u0060Truly this, Qur\u0027n that comprises all of that [mentioned], is manifest sorcery\u0027: a variant reading [for la-sihrun] has la- shirun, \u0060a sorcerer\u0027, where it is the Prophet (s) to whom they are referring [as being \u0060a manifest sorcerer\u0027].",
  "Truly your Lord is God Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, of the days of this world, that is, in the same measure [of time], since there was no sun or moon then: had He willed He could have created them in an instant, but the reason for His not having done so is that He wanted to teach His creatures to be circumspect; then He presided upon the Throne, a presiding befitting of Him, directing affairs, among creatures. There is no (m min indicates a relative clause) intercessor, to intercede for anyone, save after His permission: a refutation of their saying, \u0060The idols intercede for us!\u0027; that, Creator and Director, is God, your Lord, so worship Him, affirm His Oneness. Will you not remember? (tadhakkarna: the original t\u0027 [of tatadhakkarna] has been assimilated with the dhl).",
  "To Him, exalted be He, is the return of all of you: God\u0027s promise, in truth (both [wa\u0060da and haqqan] are verbal nouns, and in the accusative because of the verbs implicit in them). Truly He (read innahu as a new sentence, or annahu with an implied lm [sc. li-annahu, \u0060Because He\u0027] originates creation, that is, He began it by originating [it], then recreates it, through resurrection, that He may requite, reward, those who believe and perform righteous deeds, justly. And those who disbelieve, for them will be a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement because they disbelieved.",
  "He it is Who made the sun a radiance, that is, emitting light, and the moon a light, and determined it, with respect to its movement, in stations: 28 stations in 28 nights every month, becoming concealed for two nights when a particular month has 30 days, or [concealed] for one night, when it has 29 days, so that you might know, thereby, the number of the years and the reckoning. God did not create that, which is mentioned, save in truth, not in vain, exalted be He above such things. He details (read yufassilu or nufassilu, \u0060We detail\u0027) the signs for a people who know, who reflect.",
  "Truly in the alternation of night and day, in [their] coming and going, increasing and diminishing, and [in] what God has created in the heavens, of angels, sun, moon, stars and other things, and, in, the earth, of animals, mountains, seas, rivers, trees, and other things, there are signs, indications of His power, exalted be He, for a people who fear, Him, and so believe: He singles these out for mention because they are the ones to benefit from them [such signs].",
  "Truly those who do not expect to encounter Us, through resurrection, and are content with the life of this world, instead of [the life] the Hereafter, since they reject [the truth of] it, and feel reassured, feel secure, in it, and those who are heedless of Our signs, [of] the proofs of Our Oneness, neglecting to ponder them,",
  "those, their abode will be the Fire because of what they used to earn, in the way of [practising] idolatry and [performing] acts of disobedience.",
  "Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds, their Lord will guide them, He will lead them, through their faith, in Him, by appointing for them a light with which they will be able to find their way on the Day of Resurrection. Rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of Bliss,",
  "their prayer therein, their request for what they desire in Paradise will be to say: \u0060Glory be to You, O God!\u0027, so that, lo!, what they request they find before them; and their greeting, between them, therein will be: \u0060Peace.\u0027 And their final prayer will be: \u0060Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds\u0027.",
  "When the idolaters sought to hasten [their] chastisement, the following was revealed: And if God should hasten for mankind evil as they would hasten good, their term [of life] would already have been concluded for them (read as the passive, with nominative ajaluhum [sc. la-qudiya ajaluhum]; or read as the active with accusative ajalahum [sc. la-qad ajalahum, \u0060He would have already concluded their term\u0027]), by His destroying them, but He gives them respite. But We leave those, who do not expect to encounter Us, to wander blindly in their insolence, hesistant and perplexed.",
  "If misfortune, illness or poverty, should befall a, disbelieving, man, he calls upon Us on his side, that is, lying down, or sitting or standing, in other words, in every state; but when We have relieved him of his misfortune, he passes on, in his unbelief, as if (ka-an is softened, its subject omitted, in other words [read as] ka-annahu) he had never called upon Us because of a misfortune that befell him. So, in the same way that supplication during misfortune and abstention [from supplication] in times of comfort were adorned for him, is adorned for the prodigal, the idolaters, that which they do.",
  "And indeed We have destroyed generations, communities, before you, O people of Mecca, when they did evil, by way of idolatry, and, indeed, their messengers brought them clear proofs, indicating their truthfulness; but they would not believe (wa-m kn li-yu\u0027min: this is a supplement to zalam, \u0060they did evil\u0027). So, just as We destroyed those, We shall requite the sinning, the unbelieving, folk.",
  "Then We made you, O people of Mecca, successors (khal\u0027if is the plural of khalfa) in the earth after them, that We might behold how you would behave, in it, and whether you would take heed from their example and believe in Our messengers.",
  "And when Our clear, manifest (bayyint is a circumstantial qualifier), verses, [from] the Qur\u0027n, are recited to them, those who do not expect to encounter Us, those who do not fear the Resurrection, say, \u0060Bring a Qur\u0027n other than this, one in which our gods are not denigrated, or change it\u0027, of your own accord. Say, to them: \u0060It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I only follow that which is revealed to me. Truly I fear, if I should disobey my Lord, by changing it, the chastisement of a dreadful day\u0027, that is, the Day of Resurrection.",
  "Say: \u0060If God had willed I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you, [nor] would He have made you aware of it (the l [of wa-l adrkum] is for negation, and is a supplement to what preceded; a variant reading has the lm [sc. la-adrkum, \u0060He would have made it known to you\u0027] as the response to the [conditional] law, \u0060if\u0027, in other words, He would have made it known to you by the tongue of someone other than myself). For I have already dwelt among you a [whole] lifetime, of forty years, before this [Qur\u0027n], not relating to you anything [of the sort], so will you not understand?\u0027, that this [Qur\u0027n] is not from myself?",
  "And who, that is, no one, does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God, by ascribing a partner to Him, or denies His signs?, [denies] the Qur\u0027n. Surely, it is that, the sinners, the idolaters, shall not prosper, they shall [never] find happiness.",
  "And they worship, besides God, that is, other than Him, that which can neither hurt them, should they not worship it, nor profit them, if they do worship it -- and these are the idols; and they say, of them: \u0060These are our intercessors with God\u0027. Say, to them: \u0060Would you tell, would you inform, God of what He does not know in the heavens or in the earth?\u0027 (the interrogative is meant as a disavowal), for if He had a partner, He [Himself] would know it, since nothing can be hidden from Him. Glory be to Him!, in [affirmation of] His transcendence, and High be He exalted above what they associate! with Him.",
  "Mankind was but one community, following one religion, that is submission [to the One God], from the time of Adam to the time of Noah; but it is also said [that this was the case] from the time of Abraham to that of \u0060Amr b. Luhayy; then they differed, some of them remaining firmly [upon belief in One God], while others disbelieved. And had it not been for a word that had already preceded from your Lord, [to the effect] that requital would be deferred until the Day of Resurrection, it would have been decided between them, that is, [between] mankind, in this life, regarding that over which they differed, in religion, by the disbelievers being punished.",
  "And they, the people of Mecca, say, \u0060Why has a sign not been sent down on him, on Muhammad (s), from his Lord?\u0027, as was the case with [previous] prophets, in the way of a she-camel, a staff or a [glowing] hand. Then say, to them: \u0060The Unseen, that which is concealed from servants, in other words, its affair, belongs only to God, and it is from this [Unseen] that signs come forth; therefore He alone can bring them forth: mine is only to covey the Message. So wait, for the chastisement, if you do not believe. I am waiting with you\u0027.",
  "And when We made people, that is, the disbelievers of Mecca, taste of mercy, [of] rain and fertility, after adversity, misery and drought, that had afflicted them, behold! they have some plot concerning Our signs, in the way of mockery and denial. Say, to them: \u0060God is swifter at plotting, at requiting; surely Our, guardian, messengers are writing down that which you are plotting\u0027 (tamkurn, is also read yamkurn, \u0060they are plotting\u0027).",
  "He it is Who conveys you (yusayyirukum: a variant reading has yanshurukum) across the land and the sea, until when you are in ships and they sail with them (there is a shift of address from second [to third] person) with a fair, gentle, breeze and they rejoice therein, there comes upon them a stormy wind, blowing violently, destroying everything, and waves come on them from every side, and they think that they are overwhelmed, that is, [that] they shall perish, they call upon God, secure in their faith, their supplication, only to Him: \u0060If (la-in: the lm is for oaths) You deliver us from these, terrors, we shall verily be of the thankful\u0027, [of those] who affirm [Your] Oneness.",
  "Yet when He has delivered them, behold! they are insolent in the earth wrongfully, by associating others with God. O mankind, your insolence, wrongdoing, is only against yourselves, since the sin thereof shall fall against them; it is [but], the enjoyment of the life of this world, which you will enjoy for a short while, then to Us is your return, after death, and We shall inform you of what you used to do, and then requite you for it (a variant reading [for nominative mat\u0060u] has accusative mat\u0060a, \u0060an enjoyment\u0027, in other words [read as with an omitted verb such as] tatamatta\u0060na, \u0060[one which] you shall enjoy\u0027).",
  "The likeness, the description, of the life of this world is only as water, rain, which We send down from the heaven, then the plants of the earth mingle with it, [they mingle] because of it, attaching themselves one to another, whereof mankind eat, [plants] such as wheat and barley and so on, and cattle [eat], of pasture, until, when the earth has taken on its ornaments, its splendour of plants, and has adorned itself, with flowers (izzayyanat, \u0060adorned itself\u0027, is originally tazayyanat, but the t\u0027 has been substituted with the zy and assimilated with it) and its inhabitants think that they are masters of it, fully capable of harvesting its fruits, Our command, Our decree or Our chastisement, comes upon it by night or day, and We make it, that is, its crops, as reaped corn, like that which has been reaped with sickles, as though (ka-an is softened, in other words [read it as] ka-annah) the previous day it had not flourished, [as though] it never were. Thus do We detail, [do] We make clear, the signs for a people who reflect.",
  "And God summons to the Abode of Peace, that is, [the Abode] of security, which is Paradise, by summoning [people] to faith, and He guides whomever He wills, that he be guided, to a straight path, the religion of Islam.",
  "For those who do good, by having faith, is the fairest reward, Paradise, and more, which is to contemplate God, exalted be He, as [reported] in a hadth by Muslim [in his Sahh]; neither dust, soot, nor ignominy, grief, shall overcome, envelop, their faces. Those, they are the inhabitants of Paradise: therein they will abide.",
  "And for those (wa\u0027lladhna is a supplement to li\u0027lladhna ahsan, \u0060for those who do good\u0027, so [understand it as] wa-li\u0027lladhna, \u0060and for those\u0027) who earn evil deeds, by practising idolatry, [there shall be] the requital of an evil deed by the like thereof; ignominy shall overcome them -- they have no protector, no defender, against God -- as if their faces had been covered with, cloaked [in], strips of darkest night (read qita\u0060an, as the plural of qit\u0060a; or qit\u0060an, meaning juz\u0027an, \u0060a part\u0027). Those, they are the inhabitants of the Fire: therein they will abide.",
  "And, mention, the day on which We shall gather them, that is, creation, all together, then We shall say to those who associated others [with God]: \u0060In your place! (maknakum is in the accusative because ilzam, \u0060adhere to\u0027, is implied [sc. ilzam maknakum]). You (antum: this emphasises the [second person plural] subject concealed in the implied verb [ilzam], and allows for the supplement [that follows]:) and your associates!\u0027, that is, the idols. Then We shall make a separation, We shall distinguish, between them, and the believers, as [is stated] in the verse, wa\u0027mtz\u0027l-yawma ayyuh\u0027l-mujrimn, \u0060Now be separate, you sinners, upon this day!\u0027 [Q. 36:59]; and their associates will say, to them: \u0060It was not us that you were worshipping (m [of m-kuntum, \u0060you were not ...\u0027] is for negation; the direct object [iyyn, \u0060us\u0027] precedes the verb in order [to accord] with the end-rhyme [of the Qur\u0027nic verse];",
  "God suffices as a witness between us and you, that indeed (in is softened, so [read as] inn) we were unaware of your worship\u0027.",
  "There, that is, on that day, every soul shall experience (tabl derives from balw, \u0060a trial\u0027; a variant reading has tatl, \u0060it shall recite\u0027, derived from tilwa, \u0060recitation\u0027) what it did before, [what] it offered in the way of deeds, and they shall be returned to God, their rightful, [their] established, everlasting, Lord, and that which they were inventing, [of lies] against Him, in the way of associates, shall fail them, shall be absent [before them].",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Who provides for you, rain, out of the heaven, and, plants [out of], the earth, or Who owns hearing, meaning the ability to make hear, that is, the creation of this [faculty], and sight, and Who brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living, and Who directs affairs?\u0027, between creatures? They will surely say, \u0060It is He, God.\u0027 Then say, to them: \u0060Will you not then fear?\u0027, Him, and believe?",
  "That, Doer of all these things, then is God, your true, established, Lord: so what is there, after truth, except error? (the interrogative is meant as an affirmative, in other words, there is nothing after it [truth] other than that [error]; thus he who mistakes the truth, which is the worship of God, has fallen into error). How then are you turned away, from faith, despite the proofs having been established?",
  "Thus, just as those are turned away from faith so, the Word of your Lord is justified concerning those who are wicked, [those who] disbelieve, and this [Word] is [either] the verse, [Q. 32:13]\u0060Verily I shall fill Hell [with jinn and mankind, together]\u0027, or it is [the following:] that they do not believe.",
  "Say: \u0060Is there of those whom you associate [with God] one that originates creation, then recreated it?\u0027 Say: \u0060God originates creation, then recreates it. How then are you deviated?\u0027, turned away from worshipping Him, despite proof having been established.",
  "Say: \u0060Is there of those whom you associate [with God] one that guides to the truth?\u0027, by [means of] setting up [definitive] arguments and creating guidance. Say: \u0060God guides to the truth; is One Who guides to the truth -- and this is God -- more deserving of being followed, or one who does not guide, [one who] is not [himself] guided, unless he is guided?, more deserving of being followed? (the interrogative is meant as an affirmation and a rebuke, in other words, the former is more deserving). So what is wrong with you, how do you judge?\u0027, [how do you make] this corrupt judgement, one where what does not deserve to be followed is followed?",
  "And most of them, in worshipping idols, follow nothing but conjecture, since they imitate their fathers therein; truly conjecture avails nothing against truth, when what is sought is knowledge. Surely God is Knower of what they do, and will requite them for it.",
  "And this Qur\u0027n is not such as could ever be produced, that is, [it could not be] a fabrication, [by anyone] besides God; but it is, revealed [as], a confirmation of what is before it, of Scriptures, and a detailing of the Book, a exposition of the rulings and other matters which God has prescribed -- wherein is no doubt, no uncertainty -- from the Lord of the Worlds (min rabbi\u0027l-\u0060lamn is semantically connected to tasdqa, \u0060a confirmation\u0027, or to an omitted unzila, \u0060revealed\u0027; a variant reading [for accusative tasdqa] has the nominative tasdqu and nominative tafslu, \u0060a detailing\u0027, [for the accusative tafsla] by [reading] an implied huwa, \u0060it is\u0027).",
  "Or do they say, \u0060He has invented it\u0027?, Muhammad (s) has invented it. Say: \u0060Then bring a sra like it, in terms of the clarity and the rhetorical excellence of its language, by way of invention, for you are eloquent speakers of Arabic like me; and call upon whom you can, for help in this [matter], besides God, that is, other than Him, if you are truthful\u0027, in [saying] that this is an invention. But they were not able to do this.",
  "God, exalted be He, says: Nay, but they denied that, the knowledge whereof they did not comprehend, that is, [they denied] the Qur\u0027n and did not reflected upon it; and whereof the interpretation, the consequence of the threats [made] therein, has not yet come to them. So, in the same [manner of] denial, those who were before them denied, their messengers. Behold then what was the consequence for the evildoers!, for denying the messengers, in other words, [behold] how their affair was concluded, by their being destroyed. In a similar manner, We shall destroy these [people].",
  "And of them, that is, [of] the people of Mecca, are some who believe in it, God being aware of this in their case, and some who would never believe therein. And your Lord knows very well the corrupters: this is a threat for them.",
  "If they deny you, then say, to them: \u0060Unto me is my work, and to you your work, that is, for each there will be a [due] requital of his deeds; you are innocent of what I do, and I am innocent of what you do\u0027: this was abrogated by the \u0060sword\u0027 verse [Q. 9:5].",
  "And of them are some who listen to you, when you recite the Qur\u0027n. But will you make the deaf to hear -- He likens them [the Meccan disbelievers] to these [the deaf] because they are not able to benefit from what is recited to them -- even though, with their deafness, they do not understand?, [even though they do not] reflect?",
  "And of them are some who look toward you. But will you guide the blind, even though they do not see? -- He likens them [the Meccan disbelievers] to these [the blind] because they fail to be guided, nay, [they are] much worse [since God says]: It is not the eyes that are blind, but blind are the hearts within the breasts [Q. 22:46].",
  "Verily God does not wrong mankind in any way, but mankind wrong themselves.",
  "And on the day when He shall gather them, it is, as if they had not tarried, in this world, or in the grave, but an hour of the day, because of the terror of what they see (the comparative sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the [third person] pronoun); recognising one another, knowing one another, upon their being resurrected, but thereafter the recognition ceases on account of the severity of the terrors (the [last] sentence is either an implied circumstantial qualifier or one connected to the adverbial qualifier [yawma, \u0060on the day\u0027]); those will verily have lost who denied the encounter with God, through resurrection, for they were not guided.",
  "And whether (wa-imm: the nn of the conditional particle in has been assimiliated with the extra m) We show you something of that which We promise them, of chastisement, during your lifetime (the response to the conditional statement has been omitted, in other words [understand it as being] fa-dhka, \u0060then so shall it be\u0027), or We take you [to Us], before punishing them, to Us they shall return, and God, moreover, is Witness, Aware, of what they do, in the way of their denials and disbelief, and so will chastise them with the severest punishment.",
  "And for every community, of the communities [of this world], there is a messenger. And when their messenger comes, to them, and they deny him, judgement is passed between them justly, fairly, such that they are punished and the messenger, and all those who accepted his truthfulness, are delivered; and they are not wronged, by being punished for no crime: similarly, We shall deal with these [disbelievers of your community].",
  "And they say: \u0060When will this promise, of chastisement, come to pass, if you are truthful, about it?\u0027",
  "Say: \u0060I have no power to, avert, hurt, from, myself, or to, bring, benefit, except as God might will, to give me power over: so how could I possess the power to bring about the chastisement? For every community there is an appointed time, a fixed period until they perish. When their time comes, they cannot put it off, they will not miss it, by a single hour, nor bring it forward, [nor] overtake it\u0027.",
  "Say: \u0060Have you considered?, [Say] inform me: If His, God\u0027s, chastisement comes upon you by night or day, what, part, is there of it, that is, [of] the chastisement, that the sinners, the idolaters, seek to hasten? (an overt noun [al-mujrimn, \u0060the sinners\u0027] has replaced the [second person, \u0060you\u0027] pronominalisation. The interrogative sentence is the response to the conditional, as [in the case where] you might say, \u0060If I come to you, what would you give me?\u0027; the intention here is to provoke terror [in them], in other words: how awful is that which they seek to hasten!)",
  "Is it [only] then, when it has come to pass, [when] it has befallen you, that you will believe therein?, that is, in God, or [it means] in the chastisement, when it has come down (the [use of] hamza [in a-thumma, \u0060is it then\u0027] is to deny [the possibility of] deferrment [of chastisement], in other words, it [your belief] will not be accepted from you [in that instance] and it will be said to you: Now, do you believe, when [until now] you have been hastening it on?\u0027, in mockery [of it].",
  "Then will it be said to those who were evildoers: \u0060Taste the everlasting chastisement!, that is, the one in which you shall abide. Are you, you are not, requited for anything but, the requital of, what you used to earn?\u0027",
  "And they ask you to tell, to inform, them, \u0060Is it true?\u0027, that which you promise us in the way of chastisement and resurrection? Say: \u0060Aye, indeed, by my Lord! Verily it is true and you cannot escape\u0027, [you cannot] elude the chastisement.",
  "And if each soul that has done wrong, [that] has disbelieved, had all that is in the earth, of riches, it would offer it as ransom, against chastisement on the Day of Resurrection; and they will feel remorse within them, for having neglected faith, when they see the chastisement, their leaders keep it [their remorse] secret from the weak ones whom they had led astray, fearing reproach, but it has been decided justly between them, [between] all creatures, and they are not wronged, in anything.",
  "Why, surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Why, surely God\u0027s promise, of resurrection and requital, is true, [is] fixed, but most of them, people, do not know, this.",
  "He gives life and makes to die, and to Him you shall be returned, in the Hereafter, and He shall requite you for your deeds.",
  "O people, that is, inhabitants of Mecca, there has come to you an admonition from your Lord, a Book which contains [mention] of that which is [permissible] for you and that which is enjoined on you, and this [Book] is the Qur\u0027n; and a healing, a cure, for what is in the breasts, of corrupt beliefs and uncertainties, and a guidance, from error, and a mercy for those who believe, in it.",
  "Say: \u0060In the bounty of God, [that is] Islam, and in His mercy, the Qur\u0027n, in that, bounty and mercy, let them rejoice: it is better than what they hoard\u0027, in this world (read yajma\u0060n, \u0060they hoard\u0027, and tajma\u0060n, \u0060you hoard\u0027).",
  "Say: \u0060Have you considered, inform me, what provision God has revealed, has created, for you, how you have made some of it unlawful and some lawful?\u0027, as in the case of [the camels called] al-Bahra or al-S\u0027iba, and carrion. Say: \u0060Has God given you permission, to make that lawful or unlawful? No! Or do you, nay [you], invent lies concerning God?\u0027, by attributing that to Him.",
  "And what do they suppose, those who invent lies concerning God, [will happen to them] on the Day of Resurrection?: do they reckon that He will not chastise them? No! Truly God is Bountiful to mankind, by granting them respite and bestowing graces upon them, but most of them do not give thanks.",
  "And you, O Muhammad (s), are not occupied with any business, any matter, nor do you recite anything regarding it, that is, regarding such a matter -- [or it means: nor do you recite anything] from God, by way of the Qur\u0027n, which He has revealed to you, nor do you perform any action, God is addressing him and his community, but We are witnesses, watchers, over you when you are engaged therein, that is, [in] the action. And not so much as the weight of an atom, [the weight of] the smallest ant, in the earth or in the heaven escapes, is hidden from, your Lord, nor what is less than that or greater, but it is in a clear, a manifest, Book, namely, the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahfz).",
  "Assuredly God\u0027s friends, no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve, in the Hereafter.",
  "They are, those who believe and fear, God, by observing His commandments and prohibitions.",
  "Theirs are good tidings in the life of this world: in a hadth verified by al-Hkim this has been explained as [referring to] a propitious vision which an individual might have or [a vision] which another might have of that person; and in the Hereafter: Paradise and reward. There is no changing the Words of God, no failing of His promises; that, mentioned, is the supreme triumph.",
  "And let not what they say, to you, that you have not been sent [as a prophet] or otherwise, grieve you. Truly (inna: indicates a new sentence) power, might, belongs wholly to God. He is the Hearer, of speech, the Knower, of deeds, and will requite them and grant you victory.",
  "Why, surely to God belongs all who are in the heavens and all who are in the earth, as servants, possessions and creatures. Those who call upon, [those who] worship, besides God, that is, other than Him, idols, are not following associates, of His, in reality, exalted be He above this: they are following nothing but conjecture, in this [matter], that is, their supposition that these are gods who intercede for them, and they are only telling lies, in this [matter].",
  "He it is Who made for you the night that you should rest therein, and the day to see: the attribution of sight (ibsr) to \u0060the day\u0027 is figurative, since one is able to see during it. Surely in that are signs, indications of His Oneness, exalted be He, for a folk who are able to hear, hearing [in such a way so as] to reflect and be admonished.",
  "They, that is, the Jews and the Christians, and those who claim that the angels are the daughters of God, say, \u0060God has taken [to Him] a son\u0027. God, exalted be He, says to them: Glory be to Him!, [in affirmation of] His transcending having offspring. He is Independent, [without need] of anyone, for only he who has need of a child would desire [to have] one. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants. You have no warrant, [no] proof, for this, that you say. Do you say about God what you do not know? (an interrogative meant as a rebuke).",
  "Say: \u0060Truly those who invent lies concerning God, by attributing offspring to Him, shall not prosper\u0027, they shall not find happiness.",
  "Theirs will be, enjoyment, [only] a little, in this world, which they will enjoy for the duration of their lives, then to Us is their return, at death, then We shall make them taste terrible chastisement, after death, because they used to disbelieve.",
  "And recite, O Muhammad (s), to them, that is, [to] the Meccan disbelievers, the story, the tale, of Noah (Nhin is substituted by [the following, idh qla]) when he said to his people, \u0060O my people, if my sojourn, my stay among you, is too great [to bear], is a hardship, for you, as is my reminding you, my admonishing you, by the signs of God, in God have I put my trust; so decide upon your course of action, resolve upon what you will do to me, together with your associates (wa-shurak\u0027akum: the ww [wa-] means here \u0060with\u0027), then let not your decision be a secret between you, concealed, nay, manifest it and proclaim it to me; then implement it against me, carry out what you desire, and do not put it off, [do not] give me respite, for I am not concerned by you.",
  "But if you turn away, from my reminding [you], I have not asked you for any wage, any reward for it, so turn [and go] away: my wage, my reward, falls only on God, and I have been commanded to be of those who submit [to God]\u0027.",
  "But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and made them, that is, those with him, successors, in the earth, and We drowned those who denied Our signs, by [unleashing] the Flood. Behold then the nature of the consequence for those who had been warned!, in that they were destroyed: likewise We deal with those who deny.",
  "Then, after him, that is, [after] Noah, We sent messengers to their people, such as Abraham, Hd and Slih, and they brought them clear proofs, miracles, but it was not for them to believe in that which they had denied before, that is, before the sending of messengers to them. Thus do We seal, stamp [upon], the hearts of the transgressors -- so that they cannot accept faith -- in the same way that We sealed the hearts of those [before].",
  "Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his council, that is, his folk, with Our, nine, signs, but they were disdainful, to believe in them, and were a sinful folk.",
  "So, when the Truth came to them from Us, they said, \u0060Surely this is manifest sorcery\u0027, [sorcery that is] clear and evident.",
  "Moses said, \u0060Do you say [so] of the Truth when it has come to you, that it is sorcery? Is this sorcery?, when the one who has brought it has indeed prospered and has invalidated the sorcery of the sorcerers? Now sorcerers do not prosper\u0027 (the interrogative in both instances is meant as a disavowal).",
  "They said, \u0060Have you come to us to divert us, to turn us away, from what we found our fathers following, and that yours both might be the greatness, the kingship, in the land, the land of Egypt? We will not believe you two\u0027.",
  "And Pharaoh said, \u0060Bring me every cunning sorcerer\u0027, [every] individual excelling in the art of sorcery.",
  "And when the sorcerers came, Moses said to them, after they had said to him, Either you cast, or we shall be the casters! [Q. 7:115]: \u0060Cast your cast!\u0027",
  "Then, when they had cast, their ropes and staffs, Moses said, \u0060What (m is interrogative and the subject, its predicate being [the following, ji\u0027tum bihi]) have you brought? Sorcery? (\u0027l-sihru [a-al-sihru] is a substitute [for the predicate ji\u0027tum bihi, \u0060have you brought\u0027]; a variant reading has al-sihru with a single hamza, making it predicative, in which case m is the relative particle of the subject) Verily God will bring it to nothing, He will efface it. Truly God does not make right the work of those who do corruption.",
  "And God will vindicate, He will establish and make prevail, the Truth by His words, by His promises, however much the sinners be averse\u0027.",
  "But with Moses, none believed save a few descendants, a party, of, the children of, his, that is, Pharaoh\u0027s, folk, out of fear of Pharaoh and their council, that he [Pharaoh] might persecute them, turn them away from his [Moses\u0027s] religion by torturing them; and truly Pharaoh was despotic, arrogant, in the land, the land of Egypt, and truly he was of the prodigal, [of] those who transgress the bounds by claiming to be Lords.",
  "And Moses said, \u0060O my people, if you have believed in God then put your trust in Him, if you have [truly] submitted [to Him]\u0027.",
  "So they said, \u0060In God we have put our trust. Our Lord, make us not a [cause of] temptation for the evildoing folk, that is, do not make them prevail over us, lest they then think that they are upon the right path and so end up succumbing to [the] temptation [of thinking that they are upon the right path] because of us;",
  "and deliver us by Your mercy from the unbelieving folk\u0027.",
  "And We inspired Moses and his brother [saying]: \u0060Appoint houses for your people in Egypt and make your houses oratories, places in which to perform prayers, so that you might be secure from fear -- for Pharaoh had prohibited them from performing prayers -- and establish, fulfil, worship; and give good tidings to the believers\u0027, of victory and Paradise.",
  "And Moses said, \u0060Our Lord, You have indeed given Pharaoh and his council splendour and riches in the life of this world. Our Lord, You have given them this, that they may lead [people] astray, as a consequence thereof, from Your way, [from] Your religion. Our Lord, obliterate, transform, their riches and harden their hearts, stamp upon them and shackle [them], so that they do not believe until they see the painful chastisement\u0027: he [Moses] invoked God against them and Aaron said \u0060Amen\u0027 at the end of his invocation.",
  "He, [God] exalted be He, said, \u0060Your prayer has been answered: thus their riches were transformed into stones and Pharaoh did not believe until he was about to drown. So the two of you remain upright, with the Message and the Call until such time as chastisement befalls them, and do not follow the way of those who have no knowledge\u0027, when they seek to hasten on My judgement -- it is reported that he [Moses] remained [alive] a further forty years thereafter.",
  "And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea; and Pharaoh pursued them, he caught up with them, together with his hosts, in insolence and transgression (baghyan wa-\u0060adwan: these constitute the [direct] object denoting reason), until, when the [fate of] drowning overtook him, he said, \u0060I believe that (annahu is [to be understood as] bi-annahu; a variant reading has innahu, \u0060truly it is ...\u0027 indicating a new sentence) there is no god save Him in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of those who submit [to Him]\u0027: he reiterated this [his submission to God] so that it might be accepted from him, but it was not; and Gabriel thrust mud from the sea into his mouth, lest [God\u0027s] mercy embrace him. And he [Gabriel] said to him:",
  "\u0060Now, do you believe, when hitherto you have disobeyed and been of those who do corruption?, on account of your being astray and your leading [others] astray, away from belief.",
  "But this day We shall save you, We shall bring you out of the sea, in your body, your lifeless corpse, that you may be, for those after you a sign, a lesson, that they might come to know your servitude and not venture upon deeds like yours. According to Ibn \u0060Abbs, some of the Children of Israel doubted his death and so he was brought out [of the sea] for them to see. And truly most people, that is, the people of Mecca, are heedless of Our signs\u0027, not learning the lesson therefrom.",
  "And verily We appointed for the Children of Israel an excellent abode, a noble [place of] residence, namely, Syria and Egypt, and We provided them with good things; and they did not differ, such that some believed while others disbelieved, until the knowledge came to them. Truly your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ.",
  "So, if you, O Muhammad (s), are in doubt concerning what We have revealed to you, of stories -- hypothetically speaking -- then question those who read the Scripture, the Torah, before you, for it is confirmed [therein] with them and they can inform you of its truth. The Prophet (s) said, \u0060I have no doubt, nor will I question\u0027. Verily the Truth from your Lord has come to you; so do not be of the waverers, [of] those who have doubts about it.",
  "And do not be of those who deny God\u0027s signs and so be of the losers.",
  "Truly those against whom your Lord\u0027s Word, of chastisement, is justified, [against whom] it is due, will not believe,",
  "though every sign come to them, until they see the painful chastisement, at which time it [their belief] will be of no use to them.",
  "If only there had been one town -- meaning its inhabitants -- that believed, before chastisement befell it, and profited by its belief -- except for the people of Jonah: when they believed, after seeing a portent of the chastisement, for they did not wait [to believe] until it came to pass, We removed from upon them the chastisement of degradation in the life of this world and We gave them comfort for a while, until the conclusion of their terms [of life].",
  "And if your Lord willed, all who are in the earth would have believed together. Would you then compel people, to do what God did not will that they do, until they are believers? No!",
  "And it is not for any soul to believe save by the permission of God, by His will, and He causes abomination, chastisement, to fall upon those who have no understanding, [those who do not] reflect upon God\u0027s signs.",
  "Say, to the disbelievers of Mecca: \u0060Behold what is in the heavens and in the earth!\u0027, of signs indicating God\u0027s Oneness, exalted be He. But signs and warners (nudhur is the plural of nadhr, that is, messengers) do not avail a folk who will not believe, according to God\u0027s knowledge, in other words, these [signs and warners] will not benefit them.",
  "What do they await, when they deny you, but the like of the days of those who passed away before them?, of communities, that is, the like of chastisements that befell them. Say: \u0060Then await, this: I shall indeed be with you among the waiting\u0027.",
  "Then We shall deliver (nunajj: the imperfect tense is [being used] to narrate a past situation) Our messengers and the believers, from the chastisement. In like manner, to [that] deliverance, it is incumbent upon Us to deliver the believers, the Prophet (s) and his Companions, when [the time comes for] chastising the idolaters.",
  "Say: \u0060O people, that is, O people of Mecca, if you are in doubt of my religion, [and] whether it is true, then [know that] I do not worship those whom you worship besides God, that is, [worshipping] other than Him -- namely, idols -- for you have doubts concerning God; but I worship God Who will take you to Him, [Who] will seize your souls, and I have been commanded to be of the believers.",
  "And, it has been said to me: \u0022Set your purpose for religion, as a hanf, inclining towards it, and do not be of the idolaters;",
  "and do not call upon, [do not] worship, besides God, that which can neither profit you, should you worship it, nor hurt you, should you not worship it; for if you do, this, hypothetically speaking, then you will surely be of the evildoers.",
  "And if God afflicts you, smites you, with some hurt, such as impoverishment or illness, there is none who can remove it save Him; and if He desires good for you, there is none who can repel His bounty, that [bounty] which He has intended for you. He strikes with it, that is, with [such] good, whomever He will of His servants.\u0022 He is the Forgiving, the Merciful\u0027.",
  "Say: \u0060O people, that is, people of Mecca, the Truth has come to you from your Lord. So whoever is guided, is guided only for the sake of his own soul, since the reward of his being guided will be his, and whoever errs, errs only against it, since the evil consequence of his erring shall befall [only] it [his soul]. And I am not a guardian over you\u0027, that I might then compel you to [accept] guidance.",
  "And follow what is revealed to you, from your Lord, and endure [patiently], the Call and their hurting [you], until God give judgement, concerning them, by giving His command, and He is the Best of Judges, the fairest of them: he [the Prophet] endured patiently until God judged that the idolaters be fought and that the People of the Scripture pay the jizya-tax. Meccan, except for verses 12, 17, and 114, which are Medinese; it consists of 123 verses, and was revealed after Ynus.",
  "Alif lm r\u0027: God knows best what He means by these [letters]; this is, a Book whose verses have been set clear, through marvellous arrangement and wonderful meanings, and then detailed, expounded, through rulings, stories and admonitions, from One Wise, Informed, that is, [from] God.",
  "[Saying:] \u0060Worship none but God. Truly I am to you a warner from Him, of chastisement, if you disbelieve, and a bearer of good tidings\u0027, of reward, if you believe.",
  "And [bidding you]: \u0060Ask forgiveness of your Lord, for [your] idolatry, then repent, return, to Him, through [acts of] obedience, and He will give you, in this world, fair enjoyment, in the way of pleasant living and abundant provision, until a time appointed, namely, death, and He will give, in the Hereafter, every person of merit, in deed, [the due for] his merit, his reward. But if you turn away (tawallaw: one of the two t\u0027 letters [of tatawallaw] has been omitted), in other words, if you object, I fear for you the chastisement of an awful day, namely, the Day of Resurrection.",
  "Unto God is your return, and He has power over all things\u0027, including reward and chastisement.",
  "As reported by al-Bukhr [by way of an isnd] from Ibn \u0060Abbs, the following was revealed regarding those who were embarrassed to withdraw [to relieve nature] or to have sexual intercourse [without their clothes] and become exposed to the heaven. It is also said: [that it was revealed] regarding the hypocrites: Lo!, they fold up their breasts that they may hide from Him, that is, [from] God; lo! the moment they cover themselves with their garments, wrapping themselves up therewith, He, God, exalted be He, knows what they keep hidden and what they proclaim, and so their hiding is to no avail. Truly He knows what is in the breasts [of men], that is, what is in the hearts.",
  "And there is not (wa-m min: min is extra) a creature (dbba is that [creature] which treads [dabba]) in the earth but the sustenance thereof rests on God, [sustenance] which He has undertaken [to provide], out of His bounty, exalted be He. And He knows its habitation, its dwelling-place in this world -- or in the loins -- and its repository, after death, or in the womb. All, that which is mentioned, is in a manifest, a clear, Book, which is the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahfz).",
  "And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, the first of which was Sunday and the last, Friday -- and His Throne, before creating them, was upon the water, borne by the winds -- that He might try you (li-yabluwakum is semantically connected to khalaqa, \u0060He [Who] created\u0027), in other words, He created them and all that is beneficial and good for you in them, in order to test you: which of you is best in conduct, that is, [which of you] is most obedient to God. And if you were to say, O Muhammad (s), to them: \u0060Truly you shall be raised again after death\u0027, those who disbelieve will say, \u0060This, Qur\u0027n that speaks of resurrection -- or, [this] that you are saying -- is nothing but manifest, clear, sorcery\u0027 (sihrun: a variant reading has shirun, \u0060sorcerer\u0027, in which case the reference is to the Prophet (s).",
  "And if we postpone the chastisement for them until, the arrival of, a reckoned time, [reckoned] moments, they will surely say, in mockery: \u0060What is detaining it?\u0027, what is preventing it from being sent down? God, exalted be He, says: Verily on the day when it comes to them, it cannot be averted, warded off, from them, and that, chastisement, which they derided shall surround them, [it] shall come down upon them.",
  "And if We cause, the disbelieving, man to taste some mercy from Us, [such as] wealth and [good] health, and then wrest it from him, lo! he is despairing, having lost hope of God\u0027s mercy, ungrateful, intensely ungrateful to Him.",
  "But if We cause him to taste prosperity after some misery, [such as] impoverishment and hardship, that had befallen him, assuredly he will say, \u0060The ills, the afflictions, have gone from me\u0027, when he had not anticipated that they would go away; yet still he does not give thanks for this; lo!, he is exultant, wanton, boastful, to people of what he has been given;",
  "save, but, those who endure, misery, [patiently] and perform righteous deeds, during times of comfort; theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward, which is Paradise.",
  "Perhaps, O Muhammad (s), you might [think to] leave out some of what is revealed to you, such that you do not convey it to them, for they do not take it seriously, and that your breast should be straitened by it, by reciting it to them, because they say, \u0060Why has a treasure not been sent down for him, or an angel not come with him?\u0027, to confirm his sincerity, as we had requested? You are but a warner, and yours is only to convey [the Message], not to produce what they have requested; and God is Guardian over all things, He is Preserver [of all things], so He will requite them [accordingly].",
  "Or do they say, \u0060He has invented it\u0027?, that is, the Qur\u0027n. Say: \u0060Then bring ten sras the like thereof, in terms of clarity and rhetorical excellence, invented, for you are Arabs who speak [Arabic] eloquently, like myself -- he challenged them to these [ten sras] first, and then to one sra -- and call, in order [for them] to assist you, upon whom you can beside God, that is, [on] other than Him, if you are truthful\u0027, about it [the Qur\u0027n] being an invention of lies.",
  "Then, if they, that is, those on whom you call for assistance, do not answer you, know, this address is to the idolaters, that it has been revealed, enwrapped, only in God\u0027s knowledge, not as an invention of lies against Him, and that (an is softened, in other words [understand it as] annahu) there is no god save Him. Will you then submit?, after this definitive argument; in other words: \u0060Submit!\u0027",
  "He who desires the life of this world and its adornment, by persisting in idolatry -- it is said that this was [revealed] regarding the dissimulators -- We shall repay them their deeds, that is, the requital of any good that they did, such as charity or kindness to kin, in it, by giving them abundant provision, and therein, that is, in this world, they shall not be defrauded, they shall [not] be made to suffer diminution in anything.",
  "Those are they for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire; what they contrive will have failed, [will] be invalid, therein, that is, in the Hereafter, and will not be rewarded, and useless is that which they used to do.",
  "Is he who relies on a clear proof, a clear statement, from his Lord, meaning the Prophet (s), or the believers; it [the proof] being the Qur\u0027n, [a clear proof] which is followed by a witness, to it of its veracity [as being], from Him, that is, from God; he [the witness] being Gabriel, and before it, [before] the Qur\u0027n, was the Book of Moses, the Torah, also a witness to it, as an example and a mercy? (imman wa-rahmatan is a circumstantial qualifier) [is such a person] like one who is not so? No! Those, that is, the ones who rely on a clear proof, they believe in it, that is, in the Qur\u0027n, and so for them will be Paradise; but he who disbelieves in it of the partisans, [namely] all the disbelievers, the Fire shall be his appointed place. So do not be in doubt, in uncertainty, concerning it, concerning the Qur\u0027n. Truly it is the Truth from your Lord, but most of mankind, that is, the people of Mecca, do not believe.",
  "And who, that is, none, does greater wrong than he who invents a lie concerning God?, by ascribing to Him partner and child. Those, they shall be brought before their Lord, on the Day of Resurrection, amid [the rest of] creation, and the witnesses (ashhd is the plural of shhid) namely, the angels, who will bear witness that the messengers conveyed [the Message] and that the disbelievers denied [them], will say, \u0060These are they who lied concerning their Lord\u0027. Surely the curse of God is upon the wrong-doers, the idolaters;",
  "they who bar [people] from God\u0027s way, [from] the religion of Islam, desiring [to have] it, seeking that the way be, crooked; and in the Hereafter they (hum, \u0060they\u0027, is [reiterated] for emphasis) are disbelievers.",
  "Such will not escape, God, in the earth and, beside God, other than Him, they [can] have no allies, [no] helpers to protect them against His chastisement. For them the chastisement will be double, for their having led others astray. They could not hear, the truth, nor did they use to see, it; that is to say, because of their extreme aversion to it, it is as though they did not have the [physical] capacity for it.",
  "Such are they who have lost their souls, for their journey\u0027s end shall be to the Fire, made everlasting for them; and that which they used to invent, [of lies] concerning God, in the way of claiming [that He has] a partner, has failed them, is absent [before them].",
  "Without doubt, verily, they will be the greatest losers in the Hereafter.",
  "Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds and humble themselves, [who] are at peace and feel reassured, or [who] repent, before their Lord: such will be the inhabitants of Paradise, abiding therein.",
  "The likeness, the description, of the two parties, the disbelievers and the believers, is as the blind and the deaf, this being the likeness of the disbeliever, and the one who sees and the one who hears, this being the likeness of the believer, are they equal in likeness? No! Will you not then remember? (tadhakkarn: the original t\u0027 [of tatadhakkarn] has been assimilated with the dhl) [will you not then] be admonished?",
  "And verily We sent Noah to his people [and he said]: \u0060I am (ann: a variant reading has inn, in which case \u0060he said\u0027 has been omitted) for you a clear warner, one whose warning is plain.",
  "That, you worship none but God. Lo! I fear for you, should you worship other than Him, the chastisement of a painful day\u0027, painful in this world and in the Hereafter.",
  "The council, the respected elders, of his people who disbelieved, said: \u0060We see you but a mortal like us, and you have no merit over us, and we see not that any follow you save the vilest among us, the riffraff among us, such as the weavers and the shoemakers, [through] rash opinion (bdiya\u0027l-ra\u0027ya: read with hamza or without [in both cases]), in other words, impulsively, without thinking you over (it [bdiya\u0027l-ra\u0027ya] is in the accusative because it is an adverbial clause, that is to say: at the time that their opinion first came into being). We do not see that you have any merit over us, for which you would deserve our following you; nay, we deem you liars\u0027, with regard to your claim to [be bringing] a Message: they [the disbelievers] included his folk with him in their address [to him].",
  "He said, \u0060O my people, have you considered: -- inform me -- if I am [acting] upon a clear proof, a clear statement, from my Lord and He has given me mercy -- prophethood -- from Him, and it has been obscured, concealed, from you (\u0060amiyat, \u0060obscured\u0027, a variant reading has the passive \u0060ummiyat), can we compel you to it, are we [able] to force you to accept it, while you are averse to it? We are not able to do that.",
  "And O my people, I do not ask of you any wealth, which you should give me, for this, for conveying the Message. My wage, my reward, falls only upon God and I will not drive away those who believe, as you have commanded me; they shall surely meet their Lord, at the Resurrection, and He will requite them and exact vengeance for them from those who wronged them and drove them away. But I see you are a people who are ignorant, of the consequence of your affair.",
  "And O my people, who would help, [who would] defend, me against God, that is, [against] His chastisement, if I drive them away?, in other words, there is none to help me. Will you not then remember? (tadhakkarn: the original second t\u0027 [in tatadhakkarn] has been assimilated with the dhl), [will you not then] be admonished?",
  "And I do not say to you, \u0022I possess the treasure houses of God\u0022 nor, \u0022I have knowledge of the Unseen\u0022; nor do I say, \u0022I am an angel\u0022, nay, I am human like you. Nor do I say to those whom your eyes scorn that God will not give them any good -- God knows best what is in their souls, [in] their hearts. Lo! if I were to say this, then indeed I would be of the evildoers\u0027.",
  "They said, \u0060O Noah, you have disputed with us and disputed with us at length, so bring upon us that wherewith you are threatening us, in the way of chastisement, if you are of the truthful\u0027.",
  "He said, \u0060Only God will bring it upon you, if He wills, to hasten it on for you, for the decision is His, not mine; and you cannot escape Him, elude God.",
  "And my counsel will not benefit you if I desire to counsel you when God desires to keep you astray (the response to the conditional is indicated by wa-l yanfa\u0060ukum nush, \u0060and my counsel will not benefit you\u0027). He is your Lord and to Him you will be brought back\u0027.",

Say: \u0060If I have invented it, then my crime will be upon me, my sin [will be upon me], that is, the punishment for it; and I am innocent of what you commit\u0027, of crime, when you attribute invention to me.",
  "And it was revealed to Noah that: \u0060None of your people will believe except he who has already believed. Do not be distressed, grieved, because of what they do, in the way of idolatry. So, he [Noah] invoked God against them with the words: My Lord, leave not [one of the disbelievers] upon the earth [Q. 71:26]. God responded to this invocation of his and said:",
  "Build the Ark, the ship, under Our eyes, under Our watch and protection, and by Our inspiration, [by] Our command, and do not address Me concerning those who have done evil, [those who] have disbelieved, [by asking] that I should refrain from destroying them; lo! they shall be drowned\u0027.",
  "And he was building the Ark (yasna\u0060 is narrating a past state [in the present tense]) and whenever a council, a group, of his people passed him, they scoffed at him, mocked him.

  "and you shall know to whom (man introduces the relative clause which constitutes the direct object of the [action of] \u0060knowing\u0027) will come a chastisement degrading him, and upon whom an enduring, an everlasting, chastisement will fall\u0027.",
  "Such that when (hatt represents the objective for [the action of] \u0060building\u0027) Our command came, for their destruction, and the, baker\u0027s, oven gushed forth, with water -- this was the sign for Noah -- We said, \u0060Load therein, in the ship, of every kind, [of every] male and female, that is, of every species of these two, two, a male and a female (ithnayn constitutes the direct object). According to the story, God gathered for Noah all the beasts of prey and birds and other [animals]; he [Noah] would go through every species [to select them] with his hands, and his right hand would fall upon a male and the left upon a female, whereupon he would take them aboard the ship; and your family -- that is, his wife and children -- save those against whom the Word has already gone forth, from among them, that they be destroyed: this was his wife and his son Canaan, in contrast with Shem, Ham and Japheth, whom he took aboard together with their three wives, and those who believe\u0027. And none but a few believed with him: it is said that these were six men and their wives; it is also said that the number of all those aboard the ship was eighty, half of whom were men and the other half, women.",
  "And he, Noah, said, \u0060Embark therein! In the Name of God be its course and its mooring (read majrh and marsh, or mujrh and mursh, both being verbal nouns, meaning, the length of its course and where it docks, in other words, the entire journey). Truly my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful\u0027, for He did not destroy us.",
  "And it sailed with them amid waves like mountains, in terms of their height and size, and Noah called out to his son, Canaan, who was standing away, from the ship, \u0060O my son, embark with us and do not be with the disbelievers!\u0027",
  "He said, \u0060I shall take refuge in a mountain that will protect me, preserve me, from the water\u0027. Said he, \u0060This day there is none that can protect from God\u0027s command, [from] His chastisement, except -- but -- him on whom He, God, has mercy\u0027, he will be protected. God, exalted be He, says: And the waves came between them, so he was among the drowned.",
  "And it was said, \u0060O earth, swallow your waters, that have sprung forth from you -- and it reabsorbed it [all] except for what came down from the sky and formed rivers and seas -- and O heaven, abate!\u0027, withhold the rain, and it did. And the waters subsided, decreased. And the affair was accomplished, the matter of the destruction of Noah\u0027s people was complete, and it settled, [and] the ship came to rest, upon al-Jd, a mountain in Mespotamia (al-jazra), near Mosul; and it was said: \u0060Away with -- perish -- the evildoing, the disbelieving, folk!\u0027",
  "And Noah called out to his Lord and said, \u0060My Lord, lo! my son, Canaan, is of my family, and You promised me that they would be saved, and truly Your promise is the Truth, which never fails, and You are the Most Just of Judges\u0027, the most knowledgeable and the fairest of them.",
  "He, [God] exalted be He, said: \u0060O Noah, lo! he is not of your family, of those [who will be] saved, or of the followers of your religion; lo! it, that is, your asking me to save him, is not a righteous deed, for he is a disbeliever and there is no deliverance for disbelievers (\u0060malun ghayru slihin, \u0060it is not a righteous deed\u0027: a variant reading has \u0060mila, the verb, with ghayra in the accusative, in which case the person governing [the verb \u0060amila] is his son). So do not ask of Me (read either fa-l tas\u0027alanni, or fa-l tas\u0027alni) that whereof you have no knowledge, in respect to saving your son. I admonish you lest you be among the ignorant\u0027, when you ask about what you do not know.",
  "He said, \u0060My Lord, I seek refuge in You, from [the sin], that I should ask of You that whereof I have no knowledge. Unless You forgive me, my excess, and have mercy on me I shall be among the losers\u0027.",
  "It was said, \u0060O Noah, go down, disembark from the ship, in peace, in safety, or with a greeting, from Us and blessings, good things, upon you and upon some communities [that will spring] from those with you, in the ship, that is, from their children and their seed, those who are [and those who will be] the believers. And [there will be other] communities (read umamun), [to spring] from those with you, to whom We shall give enjoyment, in this world, and then a painful chastisement will befall them\u0027, in the Hereafter, and these will be the disbelievers.",
  "Those, that is, these verses, containing [stories such as] the story of Noah, are of the tidings of the Unseen, [of] the tales of that which was hidden from you, which We inspire in you, O Muhammad (s). You yourself did not know it, nor did your people [know it] before this, Qur\u0027n. So be patient, in conveying [the Message] and in [enduring] your people\u0027s hurt, as Noah endured. Truly the, praiseworthy, sequel is for those who are God-fearing.",
  "And, We sent, to \u0060d their brother, from the tribe, Hd. He said, \u0060O my people, worship God!, affirm His Oneness. You have no god (min ilhin: min is extra) other than He. You, in your worship of graven images, do but invent, [you do but] invent lies against God.",
  "O my people, I do not ask of you any wage for it, for the affirmation of His Oneness. Lo! my wage falls only upon Him Who originated me, created me. Will you not understand?",
  "And, O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord, for [your] idolatry, then turn, return, to Him repentant, through obedience; He will release the sky, [He will release] the rain -- for they had been denied it -- upon you in abundance, with abundant rainfall, and He will add to you strength to your strength, through wealth and children. Do not turn away as sinners\u0027, idolaters.",
  "They said, \u0060O Hd, you have not brought us any clear proof, [any] evidence for what you say, and we are not going to forsake our gods on [the basis of] your saying, that is, because of what you say, and we are not believers in you.",
  "We say nothing, concerning you, save that one of our gods has possessed you in some evil way\u0027, rendering you insane, for your having cursed them, and so you are raving. He said, \u0060Lo! I call God to bear witness, for me, and you, bear witness also, that I am innocent of what you associate, with Him,",
  "beside Him; so plot against me, devise ways to destroy me, all together, you and your graven images, then give me no respite, grant me [no] reprieve.",
  "Truly I have put my trust in God, my Lord and your Lord; there is no (m min: min is extra) creature, no living thing that treads upon this earth, but He takes it by the forelock, that is, [but] He is its possessor and subjugator, so that no benefit or harm occurs except by His permission -- the forelock is specifically used here because he who is taken by his forelock suffers the ultimate humiliation. Surely my Lord is on a straight path, that is, [on] the way of truth and justice.",
  "And if you turn away (tawallaw: one of the two t\u0027 letters [of tatawallaw] has been omitted), that is, if you object, still I have conveyed to you that wherewith I was sent to you, and my Lord will set in place of you a folk other than you. You cannot injure Him in any way, by your idolatry. Truly My Lord is Preserver, Watcher, over all things\u0027.",
  "And when Our command, Our chastisement, came to pass We delivered Hd and those who believed with him by a mercy, by guidance, from Us, and We delivered them from a harsh, a severe, chastisement.",
  "And that was \u0060d -- [this is] an allusion to their remains; in other words, go forth in the land and look at these [remains]. God then describes their case, saying: they knowingly denied the signs of their Lord and disobeyed His messengers (rusulahu is in the plural, because when a person disobeys a messenger he has [effectively] disobeyed all of them, since they share a common principle in that [Message] with which they come, namely, [the principle of] God\u0027s Oneness); and they, that is, the riffraff, followed the command of every rebellious tyrant, [every] leader of theirs who is obstinate with regard to the truth.",
  "And a curse was made to follow them in this world, from people, and on the Day of Resurrection, a curse [will follow them] for all creatures to see. \u0060Lo! \u0060d disbelieved in, they knowingly denied, their Lord. Lo! away, [far] from God\u0027s mercy, with \u0060d, the folk of Hd!\u0027",
  "And, We sent, to Thamd their brother, from the tribe, Slih. He said, \u0060O my people, worship God!, affirm His Oneness. You have no god other than He. He it is Who produced you, [Who] began your creation, from the earth, by creating your father Adam from it, and has given you to live therein, He has made you inhabitants, living therein; so ask forgiveness of Him, from idolatry, then turn, return, to Him repentant, through [acts of] obedience. Truly my Lord is Near, to His creation by [virtue of] His knowledge, Responsive\u0027, to those who ask of Him.",
  "They said, \u0060O Slih, you had been one of promise among us, that is to say, we had hoped that you would become [our] chief, before this, that has issued from you. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped?, in the way of graven images? Truly we are in grave doubt, [doubt] creating [great] uncertainty, concerning that to which you are calling us\u0027, in the way of [affirming] God\u0027s Oneness.",
  "He said, \u0060O my people, have you considered: if I am [acting] upon a clear proof, a [clear] statement, from my Lord, and He has given me from Him mercy, prophethood, who will help me, [who will] defend me, against God, [against] His chastisement, if I disobey Him? You would only be adding, by commanding me to do that, to my loss, [my] misguidance.",
  "And, O my people, this is the she-camel of God, a sign for you (yatan is a circumstantial qualifier operated by the demonstrative noun [hdhihi, \u0060this\u0027]). Leave her to eat in God\u0027s earth and do not cause her any harm, [by] hamstringing [her], lest you be seized by a near chastisement\u0027, if you do hamstring her.",
  "But they hamstrung her, Qudr hamstrung her at their command, and he, Slih, said, \u0060Enjoy [yourselves], live, in your dwellings for three days, whereafter you will be destroyed. That is a promise that will not be belied\u0027.",
  "So, when Our command came, for their destruction, We delivered Slih and those who believed with him, they numbered 4000, by a mercy from Us, and, We delivered them, from the ignominy of that day (read yawmi\u0027idhin [if understood] as declinable, or read yawma\u0027idhin on the basis of it [yawm, \u0060day\u0027] being annexed to an invariable [idhin, \u0060that\u0027], which is the majority view). Truly your Lord is the Strong, the Mighty, the Victor.",
  "And those who did evil were seized by the Cry, so that they ended up lying lifeless prostrate in their habitations, keeled over their knees, dead,",
  "as if (ka-an had been softened and its subject omitted, in other words [understand it as] ka\u0027annahum) they had not dwelt there, in their dwelling-place: \u0060Lo! Thamd disbelieved in their Lord, lo! away with Thamd!\u0027 (this may be read, declined, li-Thamdan, or left, as indeclinable, li-Thamda, referring to the district or the tribe).",
  "And verily Our messengers came to Abraham with good tidings, of [the birth of] Isaac and, after him, Jacob. They said, \u0060Peace!\u0027 (salman is a verbal noun). He said, \u0060Peace!\u0027, be upon you, and did not delay to bring a roasted calf.",
  "And when he saw their hands not reaching to it, he was suspicious of them and conceived, he kept secret in himself, a fear of them. They said, \u0060Fear not. Lo! we have been sent to the people of Lot\u0027, to destroy them.",
  "And his wife, that is, Abraham\u0027s wife, Sarah, standing by, serving them, laughed, at the good tiding of their destruction; and so We gave her the good tiding of Isaac, and, after Isaac, of Jacob, his son, whom she would live to see.",
  "She said, \u0060Woe to me! (y waylat is an expression used in [reaction to] a serious matter; the alif [suffixed in waylat] substitutes for the y\u0027 of the genitive annexation [waylat, \u0060my woe\u0027]). Shall I bear a child when I am an old woman, 99 years old, and this my husband is an old man?, 100 or 120 years old (shaykhan is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier, operated by the demonstrative import of dh, \u0060this\u0027). Truly this is a strange thing\u0027, that a child should be born to such an aged couple.",
  "They said, \u0060Are you astonished by God\u0027s command?, [by] His power? The mercy of God and His blessings be upon you, O, people of the House!, the House of Abraham. Truly He is Praised, Glorious!\u0027, Generous.",
  "And when the awe, the fear, departed from Abraham and the good tiding came to him, of a child, he began to plead with Us, pleading with Our messengers, concerning the, matter of the, people of Lot.",
  "Assuredly Abraham was forbearing, long-suffering, imploring, penitent, always returning [to God] in repentance: thus he said to them, \u0060Would you destroy a town in which there are 300 believers?\u0027 They said, \u0060No\u0027. He said, \u0060Would you destroy a town in which there are 200 believers?\u0027 They said, \u0060No\u0027. He said, \u0060Would you destroy a town in which there are 40 believers?\u0027 They said, \u0060No\u0027. He said, \u0060Would you destroy a town in which there are 14 believers?\u0027 They said, \u0060No\u0027. He said, \u0060What if there were one believer in it?\u0027 They said, \u0060No\u0027. He said, \u0060Lot is in it\u0027. They said, \u0060We know full well who is in it\u0027 ... to the end [of the narrative].",
  "When he had pleaded with them at length, they said: \u0060O Abraham, desist from this, pleading. Truly your Lord\u0027s command, for their destruction, has gone forth, and truly there will come upon them a chastisement which cannot be repelled\u0027.",
  "And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was distressed, he was grieved on their account, and felt constrained in his power to protect them, because they had handsome faces and were dressed as [visiting] guests, and so he feared for them from his people, and he said, \u0060This is a distressful, a very difficult, day\u0027.",
  "And his people, when they became aware of them, came to him, running, hastening, towards him -- and previously, before they came, they had been committing abominations, namely, penetrative sexual intercourse with men. He, Lot, said, \u0060O my people! Here are my daughters, marry with them; they are purer for you. So fear God, and do not degrade me, [do not] disgrace me, before my guests. Is there not among you any upright man?\u0027, to enjoin decency and forbid indecency?",
  "They said, \u0060You know full well that we have no right to, no need of, your daughters, and you know well what we desire\u0027, in the way of sexual intercourse with men.",
  "He said, \u0060Would that I had strength, power, to resist you or could resort to some strong support!\u0027, [to] some clan that would help me, I would surely fall upon you. So, when the angels saw this,",
  "they said, \u0060O Lot, truly we are messengers of your Lord. They shall not reach you, with any harm, so travel with your family during a part of the night, and let not one of you turn round, lest they see the terrible predicament that will befall them, except for your wife: (read ill imra\u0027atuka, in the nominative, as a substitute for ahadun; a variant reading has ill imra\u0027ataka, in the accusative, as [her being] an exception among [his] \u0060family\u0027, in other words, do no take her along when you travel) lo! she shall be smitten by that which smites them: it is said that he did not take her along with him; it is also said that she did set out [with them] and turned round, and so exclaimed, \u0060Woe is my people!\u0027, at which point a stone struck her and killed her. When he [Lot] asked them about the time of their destruction, they replied: Truly their tryst is [for] the morning, and when he said, \u0060I want it to be sooner\u0027, they said: is the morning not nigh [enough]?\u0027",
  "So when Our command, for their destruction, came to pass We made their uppermost, that is, their cities, the nethermost -- when Gabriel raised them to the sky and dropped them upside down to the earth, and We rained upon them stones of baked clay, clay baked in fire, one after another,",
  "marked, [each one of them] with the name of the person it would strike, with your Lord (\u0060inda rabbik is an adverbial qualifier for these [stones]), and they, the stones -- or their lands -- are not far from the evildoers, that is, [from] the people of Mecca.",
  "And, We sent, to Midian their brother Shu\u0060ayb. He said, \u0060O my people, worship God!, affirm His Oneness. You have no god other than He. And diminish not the measure or the weight. I see you in prosperity, [enjoying] a grace which precludes any need for stinting [people]; and I fear for you, should you not believe, the chastisement of a besetting day, [besetting] you, destroying you (the attribution of this term [\u0060besetting\u0027] to \u0060a day\u0027 [as opposed to \u0060the chastisement\u0027] is figurative, for it [the chastisement] will take place thereupon).",
  "O my people, give full measure and weight, fulfil [the due of] both of these, in justice, and do not defraud people in respect of their goods, do not diminish anything of their due, and do not be degenerate in the land, working corruption, by killing or otherwise ([l ta\u0060tha] derives from \u0060athiya, meaning afsada, \u0060he corrupted\u0027; mufsidn, \u0060working corruption\u0027, is a circumstantial qualifier reiterating the import of the term operating it, ta\u0060tha, \u0060[do not] be degenerate\u0027).",
  "The remainder [which is] from God, that provision of His which remains for you after you have given full measure and weight, is better for you, than fraud, if you are believers; and I am not a guardian over you\u0027, a watcher, that I should requite you for your deeds: I was sent only as a warner.",
  "They said, to him mockingly: \u0060O Shu\u0060ayb, does your [way of] prayer command you, with the obligation [to make sure], that we should leave what our fathers [used to] worship, of idols, or, that we should cease, to do as we will with our goods?, meaning that such a command is an absurdity which no person calling to good would commend. You are indeed the forbearing, the right-guided\u0027: they said this in mockery.",
  "He said, \u0060O my people, have you considered that I might be [acting] upon a clear proof from my Lord and that He has provided me with fair, wholesome, sustenance from Him?, should I then blemish it with what is unlawful, in the way of fraud or stinting? And I do not desire to be inconsistent, and then partake, in what I forbid you, thus committing the same. I desire only to set things right, in your case, by way of [enjoining] justice, so far as I am able. My success, my ability to do this [successfully] and [to enjoin] other acts of obedience, is only with God. In Him I trust and to Him I turn, I return, [repentant].",
  "And, O my people, let not the breach with me, the dispute [you have] with me (shiqq, \u0060the breach with me\u0027, is the subject of the verb yajrimannakum, \u0060make you deserve\u0027, in which the [suffixed] pronoun [-kum, \u0060you\u0027] constitutes the first direct object, the second being [what follows]) make you deserve, earn you [as punishment], that there befall you the like of what befell the people of Noah, or the people of Hd, or the people of Slih, in the way of chastisement; and the people of Lot, that is, their dwelling-places or the era in which they were destroyed, are not far away from you, so take heed [of this].",
  "And ask forgiveness of your Lord, then repent to Him. Truly my Lord is Merciful, to believers, Affectionate\u0027, loving towards them.",
  "They said, in proclamation of their lack of concern: \u0060O Shu\u0060ayb, we do not understand much of what you say. Truly we see you are weak, abject, among us, and were it not for your clan, we would have stoned you; for you are not, too, powerful, [too] venerable, for us\u0027, to stone, but it is your clan that is powerful.",
  "He said, \u0060O my people, is my clan more venerable in your sight than God?, such that you refrain from killing me because of them, instead of [your] protecting me for [being the Messenger of] God? And do you put Him, God, behind you, neglected?, rejected, behind your backs, not mindful of Him? Truly my Lord encompasses, in knowledge, what you do, and will requite you.",
  "And, O my people, act according to your ability, your circumstances, lo! I [too] am acting, according to mine. You will soon know upon whom (man is the relative particle introducing the direct object of [the action of] \u0060knowing\u0027) will come the chastisement that will abase him, and who is a liar. And sit in watch, wait for the consequence of your affair: I too will be with you watching\u0027, waiting.",
  "And when Our command came, for their destruction, We delivered Shu\u0060ayb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us; and the Cry seized those who were evildoers -- Gabriel cried at them -- and they ended up lying lifeless prostrate in their habitations, keeled over on their knees, dead,",
  "as if (ka-an is softened, in other words [understand it as] ka-annahum) they had never dwelt there: \u0060Lo! Away with Midian, just as Thamd was done away with!\u0027",
  "And verily We sent Moses with Our signs and a clear warrant, a manifest and evident proof,",
  "to Pharaoh and his council; but they followed Pharaoh\u0027s command, and Pharaoh\u0027s command was not right- guided, appropriate.",
  "He will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection, and they will follow him, as they did in this world, and he will lead them, he will admit them, to the Fire -- an evil place, it is, for those entering it!",
  "And a curse was made to follow them in this [world], as well as, a curse, on the Day of Resurrection -- evil is the assistance offered!, in their case.",
  "That, which is mentioned (dhlika is the subject, the predicate of which [follows]), is [something] of the tidings of the towns, which We relate to you, O Muhammad (s). Some of them, that is, [of] the towns, are standing, only its inhabitants having been destroyed, and some, of them, have been cut down, destroyed together with its inhabitants, such that there are no vestiges thereof, much like crops harvested with sickles.",
  "And We did not wrong them, destroying them for not having committed any sins, but they wronged themselves, through idolatry. Their gods did not avail, defend, them in any way (min shay\u0027in: min is extra), those [gods] upon whom they called, [whom] they worshipped, besides God, that is, other than Him, when the command of your Lord, His chastisement, came; and they [their gods] -- through their [the disbelievers\u0027] worship of these [gods], did not increase them in anything but ruin, [but] loss.",
  "Such, like that seizing, is the seizing of your Lord when He seizes the towns, meaning its inhabitants, while they are doing wrong, by way of sins: in other words, nothing can avail them in any way when He seizes them. Truly His seizing is painful, severe. The two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim] reported [by way of an isnd] from Ab Ms al-Ash\u0060ar that he said, \u0060The Prophet (s) said, \u0022God gives [extended] respite to the evildoer, but when He seizes him there is no escape for him\u0022, whereupon the Prophet (s) recited the verse: Such is the seizing of your Lord [Q. 11:102, above]\u0027.",
  "There is indeed in that, which is mentioned of stories, a sign, a lesson, for him who fears the chastisement of the Hereafter: that, in other words, the Day of Resurrection, is a day to which, on which, mankind will be gathered, and that is a day witnessed, witnessed by all creatures.",
  "And We do not defer it but to a term [already] reckoned, [but] to a time predetermined by God.",
  "The day it, that day, comes, no soul shall speak (takallamu: one of the t\u0027 letters [of tatakallamu] has been omitted) except by His permission, exalted be He. Some of them, that is, [some] creatures, will be wretched, and [some], of them, joyous, each having been determined [to be thus] from pre-eternity.",
  "As for those who are damned, according to God\u0027s [prior] knowledge, they will be in the Fire; their lot therein will be wailing, which is a loud sound, and sighing, which is a faint sound;",
  "abiding therein for as long as the heavens and the earth endure, that is, [for] the length of the duration of both in this world, except, other than, what your Lord may will, in the way of adding to the duration of these two, such that it [their abiding] becomes indefinite: meaning that they will abide therein forever. Truly your Lord is Doer of what He desires.",
  "And as for those who are fortunate (read sa\u0060id or su\u0060id) they shall be in Paradise, abiding therein for as long as the heavens and the earth endure except, other than, what your Lord may will -- as mentioned already [of increasing the duration], which in their case is indicated by His words, an endless bounty, [one not] to be cut off. The interpretation given above seems to be the clear and obvious one, devoid of affectation, but God knows best what it means.",
  "So do not be, O Muhammad (s), in doubt, in uncertainty, concerning what these [folk] worship, of idols: We will indeed chastise them as We did those before them -- this is intended as solace for the Prophet (s). They worship only as their fathers worshipped -- that is, in the same way -- before, and indeed We chastised them; and We shall surely pay them, like those [fathers of theirs], their whole due, their portion of the chastisement, undiminished, that is, in full.",
  "And We verily gave Moses the Scripture, the Torah, but differences arose concerning it, some believing, others denying, just as [is the case] with the Qur\u0027n; and were it not for a word that went forth from your Lord, to defer the reckoning and the requital for creatures to the Day of Resurrection, the case would have been decided between them, in this world, regarding that over which they differed; and truly they, that is, those who deny it, are in grave doubt concerning it, [doubt] creating [great] uncertainty.",
  "And assuredly (read wa-in or wa-inna) to each, that is, to all creatures, verily (la-m: the m is extra and the lm is in the place of an implied oath or a separator; a variant reading has lamm, with the sense of ill, \u0060but\u0027, making the [preceding] in for negation), your Lord will pay for his works, that is, the requital thereof, in full. Truly He is Aware of what they do, knowing the inner and outer aspects thereof.",
  "So remain upright, acting in accordance with the commandment of your Lord and supplicating Him, as you have been commanded, and, let him also remain upright, he who repents, [who] believes, with you; and do not transgress, [do not] overstep the bounds of God. Truly He sees what you do, and will requite you for it.",
  "And do not incline toward the evildoers, through affection or adulation, or [by showing] satisfaction with their actions, lest the Fire touch, smite, you, and you have, besides God, other than Him, no protectors (min awliy\u0027: min is extra), to guard you from Him; and then you will not be helped, you will [not] be protected from His chastisement.",
  "And establish prayer at the two ends of the day, at first light and before sunset, that is, [pray] in the morning, at noon, and in the afternoon, and in some watches (zulafan is the plural of zulfa), a portion, of the night, that is, at sunset and late evening. Indeed good deeds, such as the five prayers, annul misdeeds, minor sins: this was revealed regarding one who kissed a female stranger and told the Prophet (s) about it, and then asked him, \u0060Is this [verse true] for me?\u0027 and the Prophet said to him, \u0060It is [so] for every person of my community\u0027, as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim]. That is a remembrance for the mindful, an admonition for those who heed them.",
  "And be patient, O Muhammad (s), in [enduring] the harm inflicted [upon you] by your people, or in [performing] prayer, for indeed God does not waste the wage of those who are virtuous, by patiently enduring through [acts of] obedience [to God].",
  "If only there had been among the generations, past communities, before you men possessing a remnant [of good sense], men of religion and virtue, forbidding corruption in the earth (this [statement] is intended to be a negation, in other words, \u0060there never were such [men] among them\u0027), except, but, a few of those whom (mimman: min is explicative) We delivered from among them, did forbid [corruption] and were thus delivered. But those who did wrong, through corruption and neglecting to forbid, followed that by which they were made profligate, and were sinners.",
  "Yet your Lord would never destroy the towns through injustice, on His part, against them, while their inhabitants were righteous, that is, believers.",
  "Had your Lord willed, He would have made mankind one community, people of one religion, but they continue to differ, in religion,",
  "except those on whom your Lord has mercy, [those] for whom He desires good, and so they do not differ in it -- and that is why He created them, that is, [He created] those of difference for that [in other words, so that they should differ] and those deserving mercy for that [in other words, so that they should receive mercy]. And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled, namely: \u0060I will surely fill Hell with jinn and mankind together\u0027.",
  "And all that (kulln is in the accusative because [it is the direct object] of naqussu, \u0060We relate\u0027; and the nunation compensates for a [missing] genitive annexation), that is, all that is necessary, We relate to you of the accounts of the messengers, that (m substitutes for kullan, \u0060all that\u0027) with which We might strengthen, reassure, your heart. And in these, accounts, or verses, there has come to you the Truth and an admonition and a reminder to the believers: they are specifically mentioned here because they are the ones to benefit from them, through their belief [in them], in contrast to [the case with] the disbelievers.",
  "And say to those who do not believe: \u0060Act according to your ability, [according] to your status, we are acting, according to our status -- [this is] a threat for them.",
  "And wait, for the consequence of your affair, we are also waiting\u0027, for this.",
  "And to God belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth, that is, the knowledge of what is concealed within them, and to Him all matters are returned (read active yarji\u0060u, meaning \u0060return\u0027, or passive yurja\u0060u, meaning \u0060[are] returned\u0027) and He will exact retribution from those who were disobedient. So worship Him, affirm His Oneness, and rely on Him, trust in Him, for He is sufficient for you, and your Lord is not heedless of what they do, but He defers [dealing with] them until their [appointed] time (a variant reading has ta\u0060maln, \u0060[what] you do\u0027). Meccan, except for verses 1, 2, 3 and 7, which are Medinese; it consists of 111 verses, and was revealed after srat Hd.",
  "Alif lm r\u0027: God knows best what He means by these [letters]. Those, verses, are the verses of the Book, the Qur\u0027n (the genitive annexation carries the meaning of [partitive] min, \u0060from\u0027) that makes plain, the one that manifests truth [distinguishing it] from what is falsehood.",
  "We have revealed it as an Arabic Qur\u0027n, in the language of the Arabs, so that you, O people of Mecca, might understand, comprehend its meaning.",
  "We will relate to you the best of narratives in what We have revealed, in Our revealing, to you this Qur\u0027n, though (wa-in: in is softened, in other words [understand it as] wa-innahu) prior to it you were of the heedless.",
  "Mention, when Joseph said to his father, Jacob: \u0060O my father (read y abati to indicate the omitted y\u0027 of genitive annexation [sc. of y ab]; or read y abata to indicate that an alif, originally a y\u0027, has been omitted) I saw, in my sleep, eleven planets and the sun and the moon, I saw them ([repeated] for emphasis) prostrating themselves before me\u0027 (sjidn: this plural form is used to describe [the act of] \u0060prostration\u0027, which is an attribute associated with rational beings).",
  "He said, \u0060O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers, lest they plot against you some plot, [lest] they scheme to kill you, out of envy, knowing that the interpretation [of the dream] is that they represent the [eleven] planets, your mother, the sun and your father, the moon. Truly Satan is to man a manifest foe, [one] of evident enmity.",
  "Thus, in the way that you have seen, will your Lord prefer you, choose you, and teach you the interpretation of events, the interpretation of visions, and perfect His grace upon you, with prophethood, and upon the House of Jacob -- [upon] his sons -- as He perfected it, with prophethood, formerly on your fathers Abraham and Isaac. Truly your Lord is Knower, of His creatures, Wise\u0027, in what He does with them.",
  "Verily in, the tale of, Joseph and his brethren -- who were eleven -- are signs, lessons, for those who inquire, about their tale.",
  "Mention, when they, that is, [when] some of Joseph\u0027s brothers, said, to some of the others: \u0060Surely Joseph (la-Ysufu is the subject) and his brother, his full brother Benjamin, are dearer (ahabbu is the predicate) to our father than we are, though we be a [hardy] band, a group. Lo! our father is in plain aberration, in manifest error, for preferring those two to us.",
  "Kill Joseph or cast him away into some land, that is, into some distant land, so that your father might be solely concerned with you, so that he might turn [his attention] to you and not be distracted by anyone else, and that thereafter, that is, after killing Joseph or casting him away, you might be a righteous folk\u0027, by repenting.",
  "One of them, namely, Judah, said, \u0060Do not kill Joseph, but cast him, throw him, into the bottom of a well (ghaybat al-jubb is the darkest recess of a well; a variant reading has the plural [ghaybt]), so that some caravan might pick him up, if you are to do anything\u0027, of what you desire, in the way of separating [Joseph from us]: so content yourselves with this [solution].",
  "They said, \u0060O father, what is wrong with you that you do not trust us with Joseph? We are indeed his well- wishers, we are indeed only looking out for his best interests.",
  "Send him forth with us tomorrow, to the desert, to frolic and play (read [first person plural] narta\u0060 wa-nal\u0060ab, \u0060that we might frolic and play\u0027, or [third person plural] yarta\u0060 wa-yal\u0060ab, \u0060that he might frolic and play\u0027), in other words, so that we might be spirited and roam freely. Surely we shall take good care of him\u0027.",
  "He said, \u0060Lo! It grieves me that you should go with him, that is, your departure [with him grieves me], because I would be separated from him, and I fear lest the wolf devour him (al-dhi\u0027b here represents the genus, for their land had many wolves in it), while you are heedless of him\u0027, distracted [by something else].",
  "They said, \u0060Truly if (la-in: the lm here is for oaths) the wolf were to devour him, when we are [so hardy] a band, a group, then we indeed are losers!\u0027, incapable [of anything]. Thus, he sent him off with them.",
  "So when they went off with him, and agreed, resolved, to put him into the bottom of the well (the response of lamm, \u0060when\u0027, has been omitted, in other words [understand it as being] fa\u0060al dhlika, \u0060they did [just] that\u0027) by taking off his shirt -- after having beaten him, humiliated him and desiring to kill him -- and lowering him in a bucket [into the well]. When he reached half-way down the well, they flung him [from the bucket] so that he would [fall and] die, but he fell into the water and took refuge near a rock. They then called to him and he responded, thinking that they had [decided to have] mercy on him. They then wanted to smash his head with a rock, but Judah prevented them. And We revealed to him, in the well, through true revelation (wahy haqqa) -- he was 17 years of age or just under -- in order to reassure his heart: \u0060Truly you shall inform them, after this day, of this affair, [this] deed, of theirs when they are unaware\u0027, of [who] you [are] (wa-hum l yash\u0060urna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the action of \u0060informing\u0027).",
  "And they came to their father in the evening, weeping.",
  "They said, \u0060O father, we went competing, shooting, and left Joseph by our things, our clothes, and the wolf ate him. But you would never believe us, even though we speak the truth\u0027, before you, you would still have accused us [of lying] in this story, because of your adoration of Joseph, so how much more so when you think ill of us?",
  "And they came with false blood on his shirt (\u0060al qamsihi has the status of an accusative [of the verb], because it is an adverbial qualifier, meaning fawqa [qamsihi]): they slaughtered a lamb and dabbed it [his shirt] with its blood -- but they forgot to tear it [the shirt] -- and they said that it was his blood. He, Jacob, said, when he saw that it [the shirt] was undamaged and realised that they were lying: \u0060Nay, but your souls have beguiled you into something, and so you did it to him. Yet comely patience!, without any anxiety! (fa- sabrun jamlun is the predicate of a missing subject such as amr, \u0060my course]\u0027). And God is the One Whose succour is sought in that [predicament] which you describe\u0027, that which you mention of Joseph\u0027s affair.",
  "And there came a caravan -- travellers going from Midian to Egypt, who stopped near to Joseph\u0027s well -- and they sent their water-drawer, the one who goes down to the water [source] to draw from it, and he let down his bucket, into the well and Joseph clung to it and he pulled him out, and when he saw him: he said, \u0060Good news!\u0027 (a variant reading [of y bushr] has y bushrya: this [vocative] call is figurative, in other words [it is to be understood as] \u0060Come [O good news], now is your time!\u0027) \u0060This is a young boy\u0027. His brothers became aware of this and came to him, and they hid him, that is, they disguised his real status, claiming that he was, as [a piece of] merchandise, by saying, \u0060This is a slave of ours: he is a runaway\u0027; but Joseph did not say anything, fearing that they might kill him. But God knew well what they were doing.",
  "Then they sold him -- they [the caravan] purchased him from them -- for a very low, a diminished, price, a handful of dirhams, 20 or 22; for they, that is, his brothers, set small store by him. So the caravan brought him to Egypt, where the one who had bought him sold him for 20 dinars, two pairs of sandals and two robes.",
  "And he of Egypt who purchased him, Potifar, the Court Officer (Qitfr al-\u0060azz), said to his wife, Zulaikha (Zulaykh), \u0060Give him an honourable place, [an honourable] residence with us. Maybe he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son\u0027 -- for he was chaste. Thus, just as We delivered him from being killed and from the well, and softened the Court Officer\u0027s heart for him, We established Joseph in the land, the land of Egypt, until he attained what [status] he attained, that We might teach him the interpretation of events, the interpretation of visions (wa-li-nu\u0060allimahu min ta\u0027wli\u0027l-ahdth is a supplement to an implied [missing part] connected to makkann, \u0060We established\u0027, in other words, [an implied] li-numallikahu, \u0060so that We might give him kingship\u0027; or else the ww [of wa-li-nu\u0060allimahu, \u0060that We might teach him\u0027] is [to be understood as being] extra). God\u0027s way [always] prevails, exalted be He, nothing being beyond Him, but most people -- and they are the disbelievers -- do not know, this.",
  "And when he reached his prime -- which was at 30 or 33 years of age -- We gave him [power of] judgement, wisdom, and knowledge, understanding in [matters of] religion, before his call to prophethood. Thus, just as We rewarded him, We reward those who are virtuous, to [the good] of their souls.",
  "And she, in whose house he was -- namely Zulaykh -- attempted to seduce him, that is, she asked him to lie with her, and she closed the doors, of the house. And she said, to him: \u0060Come!\u0027 (hayta laka: the lm [of laka] is for clarification; a variant reading has hta laka or haytu laka). \u0060God forbid!\u0027, I seek refuge with God from this, he said. \u0060Truly he, who bought me, is my lord, my master, who has given me an honourable place, [an honourable] residence, and so I cannot betray him with regard to his family. Truly, evildoers, fornicators, never prosper\u0027.",
  "And she certainly desired him, she sought sexual intercourse with him, and he would have desired her [too], he would have sought the same, had it not been that he saw the proof of his Lord: Ibn \u0060Abbs said, \u0060Jacob was made to appear before him, and he struck his [Joseph\u0027s] breast, whereupon his [sexual] desire withdrew [from his body] through his fingernails (the response to lawl, \u0060had it not been\u0027, has been omitted: [understood to be] la-jma\u0060ah, \u0060he would have lain with her\u0027). So it was, that We made him see the proof, that We might ward off from him evil, betrayal, and lewdness, [the act of] fornication. Truly he was of Our devoted servants, in terms of obedience (mukhlisn: a variant reading has mukhlasn, in other words, \u0060chosen/purified [servants]\u0027).",
  "And they raced to the door: Joseph making for it in order to escape, while she, in order to grab hold of him, caught hold of his garment and pulled him towards her, and she tore his shirt from behind, whereupon they encountered her master, her husband, at the door. She, composed herself and then, said, \u0060What is to be the requital of him who intends evil, [who intends] fornication, against your folk, but that he should be imprisoned, locked up in a jail, or [suffer] a painful chastisement?\u0027, by having him beaten.",
  "He, Joseph, said, declaring himself innocent [of the charge]: \u0060It was she who attempted to seduce me\u0027. And a witness of her own folk testified, her paternal cousin -- it is reported that he was still [a child] in the cradle -- and he said: \u0060If his shirt has been torn from the front, then she speaks the truth, and he is of the liars;",
  "but if his shirt has been torn from behind, then she has lied, and he is of the truthful\u0027.",
  "So when he, her husband, saw that his shirt was torn from behind, he said: \u0060Indeed this -- that is, your saying: \u0060What is to be the requital of him who intends ...\u0027 to the end [of the verse, Q. 12:25] -- is of the guile of you, O, women. Verily your guile is great.",
  "Then he said: O, Joseph, ignore this, matter and do not mention it [to anyone], lest it be broadcast; and you, O Zulaykh, ask forgiveness for your sin: surely you have been of the erring\u0027, the sinful; but the tale was reported and became public.",
  "And some of the women in the city, the city of Egypt, said, \u0060The Court Officer\u0027s wife has been seducing her boy, her servant. Indeed he has smitten her heart with love, (hubban is for specification, in other words, \u0060[her] love of him has entered her heart\u0027s pericardium (shaghfa qalbih), that is, its inner casing). Lo! we see her to be in plain aberration\u0027, that is, in error evident, in her love of him.",
  "And when she heard of their machinations, their backbiting of her, she sent for them and prepared for them a repast (muttaka\u0027 is food that requires cutting with a knife, since one leans upon it (ittik\u0027): this [repast] was utruj, \u0060citron\u0027). She then gave each one of them a knife and said, to Joseph: \u0060Come out before them!\u0027 And when they saw him, they were in awe of, they exalted, him and cut their hands, with the knives, without feeling any pain, because their hearts were so engrossed by Joseph, and they exclaimed: \u0060God preserve us! -- in exaltation of him -- This, namely, Joseph, is no human being: this is but a noble angel!\u0027, on account of his all-encompassing beauty, which is [a characteristic] not usually found among humankind. In the Sahh [of al-Bukhr], it is [reported] that one half of all beauty was given to him.",
  "She, the wife of the Court Officer, said, when she saw what happened to them, \u0060This is he on whose account, for the love of whom, you blamed me (alladh lumtunnan fhi is an explication of her excuse). Indeed I did attempt to seduce him, but he withheld himself, he refused. Yet if he does not do what I bid him, he verily shall be imprisoned, and verily shall be of those brought low\u0027, those abased. The women said to him: \u0060Obey your mistress!\u0027.",
  "He said, \u0060My Lord, prison is dearer to me than that to which they are urging me. And if You do not fend off their wiles from me, then I shall tend, I shall incline, towards them and become of the ignorant, the sinful: this is intended as a supplication, which is why God, exalted be He, then says:",
  "So his Lord answered him, his supplication, and He fended off their wiles from him. Truly He is the Hearer, of words, the Knower, of deeds.",
  "Then it seemed, it appeared, [good] to them, after they had seen the signs, indicating Joseph\u0027s innocence, that they should imprison him for a while, until such time as people ceased to talk of him. He was thus imprisoned.",
  "And there entered the prison with him two youths, two young men [servants] of the king, one of whom was his cup-bearer, the other, his food-taster. They noticed that he interpreted dreams and so they said, \u0060Let us try him\u0027. One of them, the cup-bearer, said: \u0060I dreamed that I was pressing wine\u0027, that is, grapes. The other, the food-taster, said: \u0060I dreamed that I was carrying on my head bread whereof the birds were eating. Tell us, inform us [of], its interpretation, for indeed we see you as being among the virtuous\u0027.",
  "He said, to them both, in order to inform [them] that he knew how to interpret dreams: \u0060The food, with which you are provided, shall not come to you, while you are asleep, but I shall tell you the interpretation thereof, while you are conscious, before it, the interpretation thereof, comes to you. This is from that which my Lord has taught me -- herein is an incitement for them to believe, which he reinforces with the following words: Lo! I have forsaken the creed, the religion, of a folk who do not believe in God and who moreover (hum, \u0060they\u0027 [is repeated] for emphasis) are disbelievers in the Hereafter.",
  "And I follow the creed of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It never was, right, for us to associate anything (min shay\u0027in: min is extra) with God -- on account of our [God-given] immunity [from error]. That, affirmation of [God\u0027s] Oneness, is from God\u0027s bounty to us and to mankind; but most people -- and these are the disbelievers -- do not give thanks, to God, and so they associate others with Him.",
  "He [Joseph] then explicitly calls them to faith, saying: O my two fellow-prisoners!, inmates [of the prison]: Are several lords better, or, is, God, the One, the Almighty, better? (an interrogative meant as an affirmative).",
  "You do not worship, apart from Him, that is, other than Him, anything but [mere] names that you have named, that you have named for idols, you and your fathers. God has not revealed any warrant, any definitive argument or proof, regarding them, regarding worship of them. Judgement, decree, belongs only to God, alone. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That, affirmation of [God\u0027s] Oneness, is the upright, the straight, religion, but most people -- and these are the disbelievers -- do not know, the punishment in which they shall end up, and so they ascribe partners [to God].",
  "O fellow-prisoners! As for one of you, that is, the cup-bearer, he will depart after three [days] and, he shall serve his lord, his master, wine to drink, as usual; and as for the other, he will depart after three [days] and, he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head: this is the interpretation of both your dreams. They said, \u0060We never dreamed a thing!\u0027; he said, decided, concluded, is the matter regarding which you sought opinion\u0027, about which you enquired, whether you spoke truthfully or were lying.",
  "Then he said to the one whom he deemed, [whom] he was certain, would be saved of the two -- and this was the cup-bearer: \u0060Mention me to your lord\u0027, your master, and say to him, \u0060There is a young man in jail who has been wrongly imprisoned\u0027. So he [the cup-bearer] departed, but Satan caused him, that is, the cup- bearer, to forget the mention, of Joseph, before his master, so that he, Joseph, stayed, he remained, in prison for some years: it is said [that he remained] for seven years, or for twelve.",
  "And the king, the king of Egypt -- al-Rayyn b. al-Wald -- said, \u0060I saw in [a dream] seven fat kine being devoured, being swallowed up, by seven lean ones, of kine (\u0060ijf is the plural of \u0060ajf\u0027), and seven green ears of corn and others, that is seven [other] ears of corn, dry, that had wound themselves around the green ones and risen above them. O courtiers! Give me [your] opinion about my vision: expound for me its interpretation, if you can interpret visions\u0027, then interpret it for me.",
  "They said, this is, \u0060A jumble, a mixture, of dreams! And we are not knowledgeable in the interpretation of dreams\u0027.",
  "And he of the two who was released, that is, of the two young men, namely, the cup-bearer, remembering (iddakara: the original t\u0027 [of tadhakkara] has been changed to a dl and assimilated with the dhl), after a time, [after] a period of time, the predicament of Joseph, said, \u0060I will inform you of its interpretation; so send me forth\u0027, so they sent him forth and he came to Joseph, and said:",
  "\u0060O, Joseph, O truthful one, one given to truth, give us your opinion concerning seven fat kine that are devoured by seven lean ones, and [concerning] seven green ears of corn and [seven] others dry, that I may return to the people, that is, to the king and his courtiers, so that they might know\u0027, its interpretation.",
  "He said, \u0060You shall sow -- that is, [go ahead and] sow -- seven years consecutively -- and this was the interpretation of the seven fat ones -- but that which you reap, leave it in the ear, lest it spoil, except for a little which you eat: thresh it.",
  "Then after that, in other words, after the seven fertile [years], there shall come seven hard, barren and unyielding, years -- the interpretation of the seven lean ones -- which shall devour what you set aside for them, of grain sown during the fertile years, in other words, you shall eat [all] this during these [seven hard years], all except a little which you have preserved, stored.",
  "Then after that, in other words, after the seven barren years, there shall come a year in which the people will be granted relief, through rain, and in which they will press [fruit], grapes, and other [seeds], because of its [that year\u0027s] fertility.",
  "And the king, after the messenger had come to him and informed him of its [the dream\u0027s] interpretation, said: \u0060Bring him to me!\u0027, that is, the one who interpreted it. And when the messenger came to him, that is, [to] Joseph, and summoned him in order to depart [from the prison], he said -- with the intention of manifesting his innocence -- \u0060Return to your lord and ask him, to inquire: \u0022What of, [what was] the case with, the women who cut their hands?\u0022 Surely my lord, my master, has knowledge of their guile\u0027; he [the messenger] thus returned and informed the king, who then summoned them [the women].",
  "He said, \u0060What was your business, women, when you solicited Joseph?\u0027, did you find on his part any inclination towards you?: \u0060God preserve us!\u0027 they said. \u0060We know of no evil in him.\u0027 The Court Officer\u0027s wife said, \u0060Now the truth is out, [now] it has become clear; it was I who attempted to seduce him and he is indeed of the truthful\u0027, in his saying, It was she who attempted to seduce me [Q. 12:26]. Joseph was then informed of this and he said:",
  "\u0060That, plea of innocence, is so that he, the Court officer, may know I did not betray him, with regard to his family, in his absence (bi\u0027l-ghayb is a circumstantial qualifier), and that truly God does not guide [to success] the guile of the treacherous; he [Joseph] then humbled himself before God and said:",
  "Yet I do not exculpate my own soul, of slipping into error; verily the soul, as such, is ever inciting to evil, except that whereon, meaning the person [upon whom], my Lord has mercy, and so protects [from sin]. Truly my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful\u0027.",
  "And the king said, \u0060Bring him to me, that I may use him for myself\u0027, that I may make him mine exclusively, with none to share [him with me]. The messenger came to him [to Joseph] and said, \u0060Respond to the king!\u0027, and so he got up and bid farewell to [his] fellow-prisoners and prayed for them. He then washed himself, put on some good clothes and entered upon him. And when he had spoken with him, he said, to him: \u0060Indeed you are on this day in our presence established and trustworthy\u0027, a person of status, entrusted over our affair, so what do you think we should do? He said, \u0060Gather food [stocks] and sow abundantly in these fertile years, then store the corn in its ears. People [from far and wide] will come to you and ask you to supply them [with provisions]\u0027. He [the king] said, \u0060Whom can I delegate this [task] to?\u0027",
  "He, Joseph, said, \u0060Place me in charge of the storehouses of the land, the land of Egypt. I am indeed a skilled custodian\u0027, one worthy of custodianship thereof, and knowledgeable in such affairs -- it is also said [that he meant]: [I am indeed] a [competent] scribe and accountant.",
  "Thus, in the same way that We were graceful towards Him by delivering him from prison, We established Joseph in the land, the land of Egypt, that he may settle in it wherever he wished, after [having suffered] hardship and imprisonment. According to the story, the king crowned him, gave him a signet-ring to wear, and appointed him in place of the Court officer, whom he removed from his position, and who later died; and so he [the king] made him [Joseph] take the latter\u0027s spouse as a wife. He [Joseph] discovered that she was [still] a virgin and she bore him two children. He [Joseph] established justice in Egypt and people became subject to him. We confer Our mercy on whomever We will and We do not waste the wage of the virtuous.",
  "Yet the wage of the Hereafter is better, than the wage of this world, for those who believe and are God- fearing. And so the years of drought arrived and afflicted the land of Canaan and Syria.",
  "And Joseph\u0027s brothers came -- except for Benjamin -- in order to secure provisions, when they found out that the [new] Court officer of Egypt was providing food at its [fair] price; and they entered to him, and he recognised them, to be his brothers, but they did not recognise him, not knowing who he was, because it had been a long time since they had seen him, and because they supposed that he had died. They spoke to him in Hebrew and he said to them, as if reproaching them: \u0060What brings you to my land?\u0027 They replied, \u0060[We have come] for supplies\u0027. He said, \u0060You might be spies!\u0027 They said, \u0060God forbid!\u0027 He said, \u0060So where are you from?\u0027 They said, \u0060From the land of Canaan, our father is Jacob, the prophet of God.\u0027 He said, \u0060Does he have children other than you?\u0027 They said, \u0060Yes. We used to be twelve, but the youngest of us passed away: he perished in the wild. He was the most beloved to him [our father] from among us; only his full brother remains, and so he keeps him by his side, in order to comfort himself with him in place of the other.\u0027 He [Joseph] commanded that they be given lodging and treated well.",
  "And when he had equipped them with their provision, [when] he had given them the full measure [of food], he said, \u0060Bring me a brother of yours from your father, namely, Benjamin, that I might know that you have been truthful in what you said. Do you not see that I give the full measure, that I complete it, without any fraud, and that I am the best of hosts?",
  "But if you do not bring him to me, there will be no measure, that is, no provisions, for you with me; and do not come near [me]\u0027 (wa-l taqrabn is [either] a prohibition, or a supplement to the [syntactical] locus of fa-l kayla, in other words, \u0060and you shall be denied [the measure] and will not [be allowed to] come near [me]\u0027).",
  "They said, \u0060We will try to tempt his father away from him, that is, we will try our hardest to seek him from him. That we will surely do\u0027.",
  "And he said to his young men (li-fityatihi: a variant reading has li-fitynihi, \u0060his servants\u0027): \u0060Place their merchandise, that [money] with which they bought the supplies, and these were a few dirhams, in their saddlebags, their [supply] sacks, so that they may recognise it when they return to their folk, and empty their sacks, and so come back\u0027, to us, deeming it unlawful to retain these [monies].",
  "So when they went back to their father, they said, \u0060O father, the measure will be denied us, unless you send forth our brother to him [to the Court officer]; so send forth our brother with us, that we may obtain the measure (read naktal or yaktal, \u0060that he may obtain the measure [for us\u0027]). Surely we will guard him well\u0027.",
  "He said, \u0060Should I -- [I will] only -- trust you with him like I trusted you with his brother, Joseph, before? despite [the fact] that you have done to him what you have done? Yet God is best at guarding (hifzan: a variant reading has hfizan, \u0060a guardian\u0027, as a specification, similar to when they say li\u0027Llhi darruhu frisan, \u0060By God, how excellent a horseman he is!\u0027); and He is the Most Merciful of merciful ones\u0027, and so I hope that He will show favour [to me] by guarding him.",
  "And when they opened their belongings, they found that their merchandise had been restored to them. They said, \u0060O father, what [more] should we desire? (m nabgh: m is interrogative, that is to say: what greater thing than this can we ask for from the king\u0027s generosity?\u0027; a variant reading has m tabgh, \u0060what [more] do you desire?\u0027, as an address to Jacob -- for they had mentioned to him his [the king\u0027s] generosity towards them). Here is our merchandise restored to us. And we shall get provisions for our family, we shall obtain supplies for them, namely, food, and guard our brother, and we shall receive an extra camel\u0027s load, because of our brother; that will be an easy measure\u0027, for the king [to grant us], given his munificence.",
  "He said, \u0060I will not send him with you until you give me a [solemn] pledge, a covenant, in the name of God, by your swearing an oath, that assuredly you will bring him back to me, unless you are besieged\u0027, such that you die, or are overwhelmed and thus unable to bring him back. They agreed to this. And when they gave him their [solemn] pledge, to this effect, he said, \u0060God shall be Guardian, Witness, over what we say\u0027, we and you. Thus he sent him with them.",
  "And he said, \u0060O my sons, do not enter, Egypt, by one gate, but enter by separate gates, lest the evil eye smite you. Yet I cannot avail, protect, you, by this that I have said, against God (min Allhi: min is extra) anything, which He might have decreed against you; this [that I have said] is only out of affection [for you]. Judgement belongs to God, alone. On Him I rely, in Him I trust, and on Him let all the trusting rely\u0027.",
  "God, exalted be He, says: And when they entered in the manner which their father had bidden them, that is, separately, it did not avail them anything (min shay\u0027in: min is extra) against God, that is, [against] His decree; it was but a need in Jacob\u0027s soul which he [thus] satisfied, and this [need] was his desire to fend off the evil eye [from them], out of affection [for them]. And verily he was possessed of knowledge, because We had taught him; but most of mankind -- and they are the disbelievers -- do not know, [about] God\u0027s inspiring His elect.",
  "And when they entered to Joseph, he took his brother into his arms, saying [to him]: \u0060Truly it is me, your brother, therefore do not despair, do not be grieved, at what they did\u0027, in the way of envying us. He commanded him not to tell them anything, and he [Joseph] agreed with him that he would devise a trick to keep him [Benjamin] with him.",
  "And when he had equipped them with their provision, he put the drinking-cup, a golden cup studded with jewels, into the saddlebag of his brother, Benjamin. Then a crier shouted, a herald cried, after they were dismissed from Joseph\u0027s court: \u0060O cameleers, caravan, you are surely thieves!\u0027",
  "They said, after, coming towards them, \u0060What is it that you are missing?\u0027",
  "They said, \u0060We are missing the king\u0027s goblet, [his] cup. And he who brings it shall have a camel\u0027s load, of food [supplies], and I will guarantee that\u0027, the [camel\u0027s] load.",
  "They said, \u0060By God,\u0027 (ta\u0027Llhi is an oath, entailing astonishment) \u0060You know very well that we did not come to work corruption in the land, and we are certainly not thieves\u0027, that is, we have never stolen [anything].",
  "They, the crier and his men, said, \u0060So, what shall be his requital, that is, the thief\u0027s, if you prove to have been liars?\u0027, when you said, \u0060we are certainly not thieves\u0027, and [if] it is found among your belongings?",
  "They said, \u0060His requital (ql jaz\u0027uhu: the subject, the predicate of which is [the following, man wujida f rahlihi) shall be [the requital of] him in whose saddlebag it is found, that he be enslaved -- this is then reiterated by His words: He, the thief, shall be the requital for it, that is, [for] the stolen item, and nothing else: this was the customary practice of the family of Jacob. Thus, [with such] a requital, do we requite those who do evil\u0027, through theft. They thus permitted Joseph to have their saddlebags searched.",
  "And so he began with their sacks, and searched them, before his brother\u0027s sack, lest he be accused [of the theft]; then he pulled it, the drinking-cup, out of his brother\u0027s sack. God, exalted be He, says: Thus, [through such] contrivance, did We contrive for Joseph, [thus] We taught him how to devise a plot to take his brother; he, Joseph, could not have taken his brother, as a slave, on account of theft, according to the king\u0027s law, [according] to the laws of the king of Egypt -- since his [a thief\u0027s] requital according to his law would have been a beating and a penalty of twice [the value of] the stolen item, but not enslavement -- unless God willed, for him to be taken according to the law of his father [Jacob]; in other words, he was only able to take him with God\u0027s will, by God\u0027s inspiring him to ask his brothers [about the nature of requital] and their responding according to [what is decreed by] their customary practice. We raise by degrees whom We will (read with a genitive annexation, darajti man nash\u0027, or [simply] with nunation, darajtin man nash\u0027), in terms of knowledge, as [We did] with Joseph; and above every man of knowledge, from among creatures, is one who knows better, better than him [and so on] until it ends with God, exalted be He.",
  "They said, \u0060If he is stealing, a brother of his stole before\u0027, that is, Joseph -- he had stolen a golden idol from his maternal grandfather and smashed it, lest he worship it. But Joseph kept it secret in his soul and did not disclose it, manifest it, to them (the [suffixed] pronoun [in yubdi-h, \u0060disclose it\u0027] refers to the word[s] in his [following] saying); he said, within himself: \u0060You are a worse case, than Joseph and his brother, because of your stealing a brother of yours from your father, and your wronging him. And God knows very well what you are describing\u0027, [what] you are mentioning with regard to him.",
  "They said, \u0060O Court officer, lo! he has a father, an aged man, who loves him more than we do, and who finds solace in him from [the anguish he feels for] his dead son; and it will grieve him to part with him, so take one of us, enslave him, in his place, instead of him: indeed we see that you are among the virtuous\u0027, in [terms of] your actions.",
  "He said, \u0060God forbid (ma\u0060dha\u0027Llhi, [lit.] \u0060refuge is with God\u0027, is in the accusative because it is a verbal noun, the verb having been omitted and placed in a genitive annexation with its direct object, in other words, [understand it as] na\u0060dhu bi\u0027Llhi, \u0060we seek refuge with God\u0027) that we should take anyone save him with whom we found our property -- he did not say \u0060[save] him who stole [our property]\u0027, being careful not to lie; for then truly -- if we were to take anyone other than him -- we would be evildoers\u0027.",
  "So when they despaired of [moving] him, they withdrew to confer privately [together] (najiyyan is a verbal noun that can be used to refer to one person or more, in other words [understand it as meaning] yunj ba\u0060duhum ba\u0060dan, \u0060one conferring with the other\u0027). The most senior of them, in years -- Reuben -- or, [the most senior of them] in opinion -- Judah, said: \u0060Are you not aware that your father has taken a solemn pledge, a covenant, from you by God, concerning your brother, and formerly (wa-min qablu m: the m is extra) you failed regarding Joseph? (but it [the m] is also said to be relating to the verbal action, [in other words it is] a subject, the predicate of which is min qabl, \u0060formerly\u0027). So I will never leave, part with, this land, the land of Egypt, until my father permits me, to return to him, or God judges for me, through the deliverance of my brother; and He is the best, the fairest, of judges.",
  "Go back to your father and say, \u0022O our father, your son has indeed stolen and we testified, against him, only regarding what we knew, from the certainty of having seen the [king\u0027s] cup in his saddlebag; we could not have guarded against the Unseen, that which was hidden from us, when we gave our pledge: had we known that he would steal, we would not have taken him [with us to Egypt].",
  "And ask the city in which we were -- namely Egypt -- in other words, send forth [someone] to ask its people, and the caravan, the men of the caravan, with which we approached -- and these were a group of Canaanites. Surely we speak the truth\u0022 \u0027, in what we say. So they went back to him and told him as much.",
  "\u0060Nay,\u0027 he said, \u0060but your souls have beguiled you into, have adorned [for you], something, and you did it: he accused them because of what had happened with them before concerning Joseph. Yet comely patience, will be my [course of] patience! It may be that God will bring them, Joseph and his two brothers, all [back] to me. Indeed He is the Knower, of my predicament, the Wise\u0027, in His actions.",
  "And he turned away from them, no longer addressing them, and said, \u0060Alas, my grief for Joseph!\u0027 (y asaf: the [final] alif [of asaf] has taken the place of the [possessive] y\u0027 of genitive annexation [sc. y asaf], in other words [it means] y huzn [\u0060O my sorrow\u0027]). And his eyes turned white, their dark colour was effaced and became white on account of his tears, with grief, for him, such that he was [filled] with suppressed agony, anguished and grief-stricken, but not manifesting his grief.",
  "They said, \u0060By God, you will never cease remembering Joseph until you are consumed, on the verge of perishing, on account of your illness (it [haradan, \u0060consumed\u0027] is a verbal noun equally [applicable] to one person or more) or you are of those who perish\u0027, [of] the dead.",
  "He said, to them: \u0060I complain of my anguish -- (bathth is) severe grief, which cannot be endured unless it is proclaimed [yubaththu] to others -- and grief only to God, not to any other than Him, for it is worth complaining to Him; and I know from God what you do not know, [and that is] that Joseph\u0027s dream is true and that he is alive. Then he said:",
  "O my sons, go and enquire about Joseph and his brother, seek news of them, and do not despair of God\u0027s [gracious] Spirit, His mercy. Indeed none despairs of the [gracious] Spirit of God save the disbelieving folk\u0027: and so they departed to Egypt [to look] for Joseph.",
  "And so when they entered to him, they said, \u0060O Court officer, misfortune, hunger, has befallen us and our family; and we have come with reject merchandise, refused by any person who sees it, because of its worthlessness -- it consisted of counterfeit dirhams or something else -- so fill up, complete, for us the measure and be charitable to us, by overlooking the worthlessness of our merchandise; truly God requites the charitable\u0027, He rewards them: he [Joseph] thus took pity on them and he was overtaken by compassion [for them] and removed the partition between them and himself.",
  "Then, he said, to them, in rebuke: \u0060Do you realise what you did to Joseph, in the way of beating [him] and selling [him] and otherwise, and his brother, oppressing him, after having separated him from his brother, while you were ignorant?\u0027, of where the affair of Joseph will lead?",
  "They said -- after recognising him by his noble traits -- cautiously [inquiring]: \u0060Is it really (read a-innaka, either pronouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the second, but in both cases inserting an alif) you, Joseph?\u0027. He said, \u0060I am [indeed] Joseph, and this is my brother. God has truly shown favour, He has been gracious, to us, by bringing [us] together. Verily if one fears, [if] one fears God, and endures, what happens to him, God does not waste the wage of those who are virtuous\u0027, in this [respect] (the overt noun [al- muhsinn, \u0060the virtuous\u0027] has replaced the [third person] pronominalisation).",
  "They said, \u0060By God, truly God has preferred you over us, with kingship and in other ways, and indeed we (wa-in: in is softened, in other words [it is understood as] inn, \u0060indeed we\u0027) have been erring\u0027, sinful towards you and treated you disgracefully.",
  "He said, \u0060There shall be no reproach, [no] blame, on you this day -- he specifically mentions this [day] because it was [the day] when they expected to be reproached, although any other day would have been more appropriate [for them to be reproached on]. God will forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.",
  "He [Joseph] asked them about his father; and they told him that his eyesight had gone. And so he said: Go with this shirt of mine -- and this was the shirt of Abraham, the one he wore when he was thrown into the fire; he [Joseph] had it around his neck when he was at the bottom of the well. It [the shirt] had come from Paradise: Gabriel commanded him [Joseph] to send it off [to Jacob] saying that the scent of Paradise lingers in it, and whenever it is cast upon a sufferer, it heals him -- and lay it on my father\u0027s face, and he will recover his sight; and bring me all your folk\u0027.",
  "And as the caravan set forth, leaving behind the palm fields of Egypt, their father said, to those of his sons and their children present, \u0060Truly I sense the scent of Joseph -- which the east wind had brought to him, with God\u0027s permission, across a distance of three or eight or more days\u0027 journey; if only you did not think me doting\u0027, [if only] you [did not] regard me as foolish, you would believe me.",
  "They said, to him: \u0060By God, you are certainly in your misguidance, your error, of old\u0027, in your excessive adoration of him, and your [enduring] hope of encountering him [again] despite the length of time [that has passed].",
  "Then, when (fa-lamm an: an is extra) the bearer of good tidings, Judah, came, with the shirt -- he had [been the one who] brought the blood-stained shirt, and so now he wished to bring him joy, after he had [previously] brought him grief -- he laid it, he cast the shirt, on his face and he regained his sight. He said, \u0060Did I not say to you, \u0022Indeed I know from God what you do not know?\u0022 \u0027",
  "They said, \u0060O our father, ask forgiveness for us of our sins; truly we have been sinful\u0027.",
  "He said, \u0060Assuredly I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful\u0027: he [Jacob] put off this [plea of forgiveness] until [the last hour] before dawn, in order to be closer to [the likelihood of] it being accepted, or [he put it off] until the eve of Friday. They then departed for Egypt, where Joseph and the senior courtiers came out to meet them.",
  "And when they entered to Joseph, in his tent, he took his parents, his father and his mother -- or [and] his maternal aunt -- into his arms, and said, to them: \u0060Enter into Egypt, if God will, in safety\u0027, and they entered, and Joseph sat down on his throne.",
  "And he raised his parents, he seated them next to him, upon the throne, and they fell down, that is, his parents and brothers, prostrating before him -- a prostration that was [actually] a bowing down, not placing their foreheads down [on the ground]; this was their standard [form of] greeting at that time. Then he said, \u0060O father, this is the interpretation of my vision of old. Indeed my Lord has made it true. And indeed He has been gracious to me, since He brought me out of the prison -- he did not say \u0060out of the well\u0027, in [a show of] magnanimity, lest his brothers feel ashamed -- and has brought you from the desert after Satan had incited ill feeling, made trouble, between me and my brethren. Truly my Lord is Subtle in [bringing about] what He will. Truly He is the Knower, of His creatures, the Wise, in His actions. His father [Jacob] remained with him for 24 years, or for 17 years. The duration of his separation [from Joseph] had been 18, or 40, or 80 years. When death approached him, he charged Joseph to take him and bury him by his father [Isaac], and so he [Joseph] himself went and buried him there. He [Joseph] then returned to Egypt and remained [alive] for another 23 years.",
  "When he was nearing his end, realising that he would not remain [alive] forever, he longed for the everlasting kingdom and said: My Lord, indeed You have given me [something] of sovereignty and You have taught me the interpretation of events, the ability to explain dreams. Originator, Creator, of the heavens and the earth! You are my Protector, Guardian of my best interests, in this world and the Hereafter. Take me [in death] to You in submission [to You] and join me to the righteous\u0027, from among my fathers. He lived after that for another week or more. He died at the age of 120 years. The Egyptians were very covetous with regard to his grave; [eventually] they placed him in a marble coffin and buried him at the top of the Nile so that both banks would be blessed [by his body] -- Glory be to the One Whose Kingdom never ends.",
  "That, which is mentioned of the matter of Joseph, is of the tidings, the tales, of the Unseen, what has been hidden from you O Muhammad (s), which We reveal to you; for you were not with them, with Joseph\u0027s brothers, when they agreed upon their plan, to plot against him, that is, [when] they resolved upon it, and schemed, against him; in other words, you were not present among them to know their story and so tell it to others: knowledge of it has come to you through revelation.",
  "Yet, most people, that is, the people of Mecca, however eager you might be, that they believe, will not believe.",
  "Nor do you ask them any wage, that you should take, for it, that is, [for] the Qur\u0027n -- it, namely, the Qur\u0027n, is but a reminder, an admonition, to all the worlds.",
  "And how many a sign, indicating the Oneness of God, is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by, which they witness, but disregard!, not reflecting upon it.",
  "And most of them do not believe in God, such that they might affirm that He is the Creator and the Sustainer, without ascribing partners, to Him, by worshipping idols; which is why, when crying their [ritual] response to God, they used to say: \u0060At Your service, no partner have You, save a partner that belongs to You; You possess him and all that he possesses\u0027, meaning it [when they said it].",
  "Do they deem themselves secure from the coming upon them of a pall, a calamity enveloping them, of God\u0027s chastisement, or the coming of the Hour upon them suddenly, while they are unaware?, of the time of its arrival beforehand?",
  "Say, to them: \u0060This is my way -- which He explains by saying: I call to, the religion of, God, being upon sure knowledge, plain proof, I and whoever follows me, [whoever] believes in me (man ittaba\u0060an is a supplement to an, \u0060I\u0027, the subject, predicated by what preceded [sc. \u0060being upon sure knowledge\u0027]). So Glory be to God!, [in affirmation] of His being exalted high above having partners, and I am not of the idolaters\u0027 -- this [sentence] is also subsumed by the [explanation of] his statement about \u0060his way\u0027.",
  "And We did not send before you [any messengers] save men inspired by revelation (yh ilayhim: a variant reading has nh ilayhim, \u0060to whom We revealed\u0027) -- and not angels -- from among the people of the towns, the principal towns, since they are more knowledgeable and wiser than the people of the desert, who are crude and ignorant. Have they, the people of Mecca, not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them?, that is, how they ended up, when they were destroyed for denying their messengers? And verily the abode of the Hereafter, that is, Paradise, is better for those who are wary, of God. Will they not understand? (read a-fa-l ya\u0060qiln, or a-fa-l ta\u0060qiln. \u0060Will you not understand?\u0027), this, O people of Mecca, and so have faith?",
  "Until (hatt indicates the end [result] indicated by [the previous statement] wa-m arsaln min qablika ill rijlan, And We did not send before you [any messengers] save men [above, Q. 12:109]), that is, [to whom] Our support waned until, when the messengers despaired and thought, [when] the messengers were certain, that they were denied (read kudhdhib, to mean [that they were denied] to such an extent that [they believed that] there would not be any [possible acceptance of] faith thereafter; or read kudhib, to mean that the communities thought that their messengers had been lied to concerning the victory which they had been promised), Our help came to them and whomever We willed We delivered (read fa-nunajj or fa-nunj; or fa-nujjiya, as past tense, \u0060[whomever We wished] was delivered\u0027). And Our wrath, Our chastisement, cannot be averted from the sinning, the idolatrous, folk.",
  "Verily there is in their stories, that is, the messengers\u0027 [stories], a lesson for people of pith, possessors of intellect. It, this Qur\u0027n, is not a fabricated, an invented, discourse but, it is, a confirmation of what was [revealed] before it, of scriptures, and a detailing, an elucidation, of everything, that one needs for [the proper observance of] religion, and a guidance, from error, and a mercy for a folk who believe: such [folk] are singled out for mention because they are the ones to benefit from it, to the exclusion of others. Meccan, except for the verse [beginning with] \u0060Those who disbelieve will continue to ...\u0027 [second half of 31], and the verse \u0060And those who disbelieve will say, \u0060You are not sent [by God]\u0027. Alternatively, it is Medinese, except for the two verses [sc. verse 31], \u0060If only it were a Qur\u0027n ...\u0027; it consists of 43, 44, 45 or 46 verses.",
  "Alif lm mm r\u0027: God knows best what He means by these [letters]. Those, these verses, are the verses of the Book, the Qur\u0027n (the genitive annexation carries the meaning of [partitive] min, \u0060from\u0027), and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, namely, the Qur\u0027n (this [preceding sentence] constitutes the subject, the predicate of which is [the following]), is the Truth, wherein is no doubt, but most people, that is, the people of Mecca, do not believe, that it is from God, exalted be He.",
  "God is He Who raised up the heavens without visible supports (\u0060amad is the plural of \u0060imd, which is [the same as] an ustuwna, \u0060a column\u0027; and this [statement] is true, since there are no actual supports) then presided upon the Throne, a presiding befitting Him, and disposed, made subservient, the sun and the moon, each one, of them, moving, along its course, until [the conclusion of] an appointed time, that is, [until] the Day of Resurrection. He directs the command, He conducts the affairs of His Kingdom. He details, He expounds, the signs, the indications of His power, so that you, O people of Mecca, might be certain of the encounter with your Lord, through resurrection.",
  "And He it is Who spread out, extended [flat], the earth and set, created, therein firm mountains and rivers, and of every fruit He has made in it two kinds, of every species. He covers, He cloaks, the night, and its darkness, with the day. Surely in that, which is mentioned, are signs, indications of His Oneness, exalted be He, for a people who reflect, upon God\u0027s handiwork.",
  "And on the earth are tracts, diverse terrains, neighbouring each other, joined side by side, some good, some briny, some of little yield and some fruitful -- and these constitute proofs of His power, exalted be He -- and gardens, orchards, of vines and sown fields (read zar\u0060un, in the nominative, as a supplement to janntun, \u0060gardens\u0027, or read zar\u0060in, in the genitive, [as a supplement] to a\u0060nbin, \u0060of vines\u0027); similarly [constituting proofs of His power are] His words: and date-palms sharing one root (sinwn is the plural of sinw, which are date-palms belonging to the same root, but with many offshoots) and date-palms otherwise, [each] of individual root, watered (read tusq as [referring to] jannt, \u0060gardens\u0027, and what is in them, or read yusq as [referring to] the mentioned [date-palms]) by the same [source of] water; and We make some of them to excel (wa-nufaddil, or read wa-yufaddil, \u0060and He [God] makes [some of them] to excel\u0027) others in flavour (read f\u0027l-ukul or f\u0027l-ukl): and so some are sweet, others, bitter -- and these are [also] proofs of His power, exalted be He. Surely in that, which is mentioned, are signs for a people who understand, [who] reflect.",
  "And if you wonder, O Muhammad (s), at the disbelievers denying you, then surely wondrous, [surely] deserving wonder, is their saying, in denial of resurrection: \u0060When we have become dust, shall we indeed then be [raised] in a new creation?\u0027, [it is wondrous] because the One Who has the power to originate creation and [to originate] what has been mentioned [above], without any precedent, has [also] the power to restore them [to life] (both hamzas, in both instances [a-idh and a-inn], are pronounced; or [one may] pronounce the first and not pronounce the second, but in both cases inserting an alif or not [inserting it]; one variant reading has the first [a-idh] as the interrogative, and the second one [a-inn] as the predicate, while another variant reading has the [exact] opposite). Those are the ones who disbelieve in their Lord; those -- fetters shall be around their necks; and those, they shall be the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding therein.",
  "The following was revealed regarding their hastening on, out of mockery, of the chastisement: And they would have you hasten on the evil, the chastisement, rather than the good, [rather than] mercy, when there have indeed occurred before them exemplary punishments (mathult is the plural of mathula, similar [in pattern] to samura [pl. samurt], \u0060acacia\u0027), that is to say, the punishments of disbelievers like them: will they not take warning from these? Truly your Lord is forgiving to mankind despite their evil-doing, for otherwise He would not have left a single creature on the face of it [the earth]; and truly your Lord is severe in retribution, against those who disobey Him.",
  "And those who disbelieve say, \u0060Why has not some sign been sent down upon him, upon Muhammad (s), from his Lord!\u0027, the like of the staff and the [glowing] hand, or the she-camel. God, exalted be He, says: You are only a warner, one to threaten the disbelievers, for it is not your duty to bring forth signs; and for every folk there is a guide, a prophet, to guide them to their Lord with the signs that He gives him, and not what with they request.",

  "For him, for man, are attendants, angels who follow him, to his front and to his rear, guarding him through God\u0027s command, that is, by His command, from [the danger of] the jinn and others. Indeed God does not alter the state of a people -- He does not deprive them of His grace -- unless they have altered the state of their souls, from [their] comely nature, through an act of disobedience. And if God wills misfortune, chastisement, for a people there is none that can repel it, either from among the attendant angels or others; and they, for whom God wills misfortune, have no protector (min wlin: min is extra) to avert it from them, apart from Him, that is, other than God.",
  "He it is Who shows you the lightning, [inspiring] fear, in travellers, of thunderbolts, and hope, for those who are at home, of rain; and He produces, He creates, the clouds that are heavy, with rain.",

He unleashes the thunderbolts -- these are a fire which issues forth from the clouds -- and smites with them whom He will, such that it burns [that person]: this was revealed regarding a man to whom the Prophet (s) had sent someone to invite [to Islam] and who said, \u0060Who is the Messenger of God? And what is God? Is He [made] of gold, or of silver, or of copper?\u0027, whereupon a thunderbolt came down on him and blew off the top of his head; yet they, that is, the disbelievers, dispute, argue with the Prophet (s), about God, though He is great in might, in power, or in [the severity of His] retribution.",
  "His, exalted be He, is the call of truth, that is, the words that constitute it [the truth], and these are: \u0060there is no god but God\u0027 (l ilha ill\u0027Llh); and those upon whom they call (read yad\u0060n or tad\u0060n, \u0060you call\u0027), [those whom] they worship, apart from Him, that is, other than Him -- namely, the idols -- do not answer them anything, of which they ask; save as, is the response to, one who stretches forth his hands towards water, at the edge of a well, calling to it, that it may reach his mouth, by its rising through the well to [reach] him, but it would never reach it, that is, [reach] his mouth, ever: likewise they [the idols] will not answer them; and the call of the disbelievers, their worship of idols -- or their actual supplication -- goes only astray, [it is only] in perdition.",
  "And to God prostrate whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly, such as believers, or unwillingly, such as hypocrites and those coerced by the sword, and their shadows also, prostrate, in the mornings and the evenings.",
  "Say, O Muhammad (s), to your people: \u0060Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?\u0027 Say: \u0060God\u0027 -- and even if they do not say it, there can be no other response. Say, to them: \u0060Then have you taken beside Him, other than Him, protectors, idols, to worship, who have no power to benefit or harm themselves?\u0027, and you abandon the One Who is their Possessor? (an interrogative meant as a rebuke). Say: \u0060Are the blind one and the seer, [respectively], the disbeliever and the believer, equal? Or are darkness, disbelief, and the light, faith, equal? No! Or have they set up for God associates who have created the like of His creation, so that creation seems alike, that is, [is] what the associates create and the creation of God [alike], to them?\u0027, so that they believe them worthy of being worshipped on account of what these [associates] have created? (an interrogative of disavowal); in other words, not so! None save the Creator is worthy of being worshipped. Say: \u0060God is the Creator of all things, having no associate therein, and so He cannot have an associate in terms of worship; and He is the One, the Subjugator\u0027, of His servants.",
  "He then strikes a similitude of truth and falsehood, saying: He, exalted be He, sends down water, rain, from the sky, whereat the valleys flow according to their measure, according to their full capacity, and the flood carries a scum that swells, rising above it, and this [scum] is the filth and the like that lies on the surface of the earth, and from that which they smelt (read tqidn, \u0060you smelt\u0027, or yqidn, \u0060they smelt\u0027) in the fire, of the earth\u0027s minerals, such as gold, silver or copper, desiring, seeking [to make], ornaments, adornment, or ware, which is useful, such as utensils, when they [the minerals] are melted; [there rises] a scum the like of it, that is, the like of the scum of the flood, and this [latter scum] consists of the impurities expelled by the bellows. Thus, in the way mentioned, God points out truth and falsehood, that is, [He points out] the similitude thereof. As for the scum, of the flood and of the minerals smelted, it passes away as dross, useless refuse, while that which is of use to mankind, in the way of water and minerals, lingers, remains, in the earth, for a time: likewise, falsehood wanes and is [eventually] effaced, even if it should prevail over the truth at certain times. Truth, on the other hand, is established and enduring. Thus, in the way mentioned, God strikes, He makes clear, similitudes.",
  "For those who respond to their Lord, [those who] answer Him, by way of obedience, there shall be the goodly reward, Paradise, and those who do not respond to Him, namely the disbelievers -- if they possessed all that is in the earth, and therewith the like of it, they would offer it to redeem themselves therewith, against the chastisement. For such there shall be an awful reckoning, and that is that they will be requited for every single thing they did, none of which will be forgiven, and their abode shall be Hell, an evil resting place, it is!",
  "The following was revealed regarding Hamza and Ab Jahl: Is he who knows that what is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, and so believes in it, like him who is blind?, and does not know it, nor believes in it? No! But only people of pith, possessors of intellect, remember, heed [such admonitions];",
  "such as fulfil God\u0027s covenant, [meaning] the one that was taken from them while they were still atoms -- or [meaning] any covenant -- and do not break the pact, by abandoning belief, or [religious] obligations;",
  "and such as cement what God has commanded should be cemented, of faith and kinship ties and so forth, and fear their Lord, that is, His Threat [of punishment], and dread an awful reckoning -- a similar [statement] has preceded;",
  "such as are patient, through obedience and [during] hardship, and [staying] away from disobedience, desiring, seeking, their Lord\u0027s countenance, and nothing else, from among the transient things of this world; and maintain the prayer and expend, in obedience, of that which We have provided them, secretly and openly, and repel evil with good, such as [repelling] ignorance through forbearance, and harm through patience; those, theirs shall be the sequel of the [heavenly] Abode: that is, the praiseworthy sequel in the Hereafter, namely:",

  "They will say [to them]: \u0060Peace be upon you, this is the reward, for your patience\u0027, during life on earth. How excellent is, your sequel, the sequel of the [heavenly] Abode!",

  "God expands provision, He makes it abundant, for whom He will, and straitens, restricts it, for whomever He will; and they, the people of Mecca, rejoice, a wanton rejoicing, in the life of this world, that is, in what they acquire therein, yet the life of this world, in, comparison with the life of, the Hereafter, is but [a brief] enjoyment, a trifling thing, enjoyed and then lost.",
  "And those who disbelieve, from among the people of Mecca, say, \u0060Why has not some sign, like the staff and the [glowing] hand or the she-camel, been sent down upon him, upon Muhammad (s), from his Lord?\u0027 Say, to them: \u0060Indeed God sends astray whomever He will, to send astray -- such that signs cannot avail him in any way -- and He guides, He directs, to Him, to His religion, those who turn in repentance\u0027, [those who] return to Him (man, \u0060those who\u0027, is substituted by [the following, alladhna, \u0060those who ...\u0027]);",
  "those who believe and whose hearts are reassured, find rest, by God\u0027s remembrance, that is, by His promise [of reward]. Verily by God\u0027s remembrance are hearts reassured, that is, the hearts of the believers;",

  "Thus, just as We sent prophets before you, We have sent you to a community before whom other communities have passed away, that you may recite to them that which We have revealed to you, that is, the Qur\u0027n; yet they disbelieve in the Compassionate One, for, when they were commanded to prostrate themselves to Him, they said, \u0060And what is the Compassionate One?\u0027 Say, to them, O Muhammad (s): \u0060He is my Lord; there is no god save Him. In Him I trust and to Him is my recourse\u0027.",
  "The following was revealed when they said to him, \u0060If you are [truly] a prophet, then make these mountains of Mecca drift away before us, and make for us rivers and springs in it, that we may plant and sow seeds, and resurrect for us our dead fathers to speak to us and tell us that you are a prophet\u0027: Even if it were a Qur\u0027n whereby the mountains were set in motion, moved from their places, or the earth were cleft, torn, or the dead were spoken to, such that they would respond, they still would not believe. Nay, but the affair belongs entirely to God, and none other, so that none believes except he whom He wills that he believes, and no other; even if they were given what they request [of signs]. The following was revealed when the Companions were keen that what was requested [of signs] should be manifested, hoping that they [the ones requesting them] might believe: Have they not realised, those who believe, that (an is softened, in other words [understand it as] annahu) had God willed, He could have guided all mankind?, to faith, without [the need for] any sign? And the disbelievers, from among the people of Mecca, continue to be struck by devastation, a catastrophe that devastates them through all manner of hardship, such as being killed, taken captive, and [suffering] war or drought, because of what they wrought, because of their actions, that is, their disbelief; or you alight, O Muhammad (s), together with your army, near their home -- Mecca -- until God\u0027s promise, of victory against them, comes to pass; truly God does not break His promise: and indeed, he alighted at Hudaybiyya until the conquest of Mecca took place;",
  "messengers were certainly mocked before you, in the same way that you have been mocked -- this is meant as solace for the Prophet (s) -- but I gave respite to those who disbelieved; then I seized them, with retribution, and how was My retribution?, that is to say, it [My retribution] will come to pass; and I shall deal with those who have mocked you in the same way.",
  "Is He Who stands, watches, over every soul what it has earned?, what it has done of good or evil -- and this is God -- like the idols who are not so? No! This [response] is suggested by [the following words]: Yet they ascribe to God associates. Say: \u0060Name them!, for Him: who are they? Or will you inform Him, will you inform God, of something, that is, of an associate, which He does not know in the earth? (an interrogative of disavowal); in other words, He has no associate, for if He did, He would know him -- exalted be He above such a thing. Or is it -- nay -- you call them associates, merely [a manner of] speaking?\u0027, that is, [it is merely] on the basis of false conjecture, without any truth in it. Nay, but their scheming, their unbelief, has been adorned for those who disbelieve and they have been barred from the way, [from] the path of guidance; and whomever God sends astray, for him there is no guide.",
  "For them there is chastisement in the life of this world, through being killed or taken captive; and verily the chastisement of the Hereafter is more grievous, is more severe; and they have no defender, protector, from God, that is, from His chastisement.",
  "The likeness, the description, of Paradise, which has been promised to the God-fearing (this is a subject, the predicate of which has been omitted), in other words, according to what We recount to you [is as follows]: beneath it rivers flow, its food, what is consumed in it, is everlasting, never perishing, and its shade, is everlasting, never replaced by any sun, because it does not exist therein. That, namely, Paradise, is the reward, the sequel, of those who were wary, of idolatry, and the requital of the disbelievers is the Fire!",
  "And those to whom We have given the Scripture, such as \u0060Abd Allh b. Salm and others from among the believing Jews, rejoice in that which has been revealed to you, because of its according with what they have with them [of revelation]; and among the factions, that aligned themselves against you in enmity, from among the idolaters and the Jews, are those who reject some of it, such as the mention of the \u0060Compassionate One\u0027 (al-Rahmn) and all that is other than the stories [related therein]. Say: \u0060I have been commanded -- in that which has been revealed to me -- only to worship God, and not to associate [anything] with Him. To Him I call and to Him shall be my return\u0027.",
  "And so, just like that [manner of] revelation, We have revealed it, that is, the Qur\u0027n, as a [decisive] judgement in Arabic, in the language of the Arabs, for you to judge thereby between people. And if you should follow their whims, that is, [those of] the disbelievers, in that to which they summon you of their creed, hypothetically [speaking], after what has come to you of knowledge, of God\u0027s Oneness, you shall have no protector, to assist you, against God (mina\u0027Llhi min: the [second] min is extra) and no defender, to ward off His chastisement.",
  "And when they derided him for having many wives, the following was revealed: And indeed We sent messengers before you, and We assigned to them wives and seed, children -- and you are like them; and it was not for any Messenger, from among them, that he should bring a sign, save by God\u0027s leave, because they are servants enthralled [by Him]. For every term, period, there is a Book, wherein is inscribed its delimitation.",
  "God effaces, of it [the Book], whatever He will and He fixes (read yuthbit or yuthabbit), therein whatever He will of rulings or other matters, and with Him is the Mother of the Book, its [source of] origin, of which nothing is ever changed, and which consists of what He inscribed in pre-eternity (azal).",
  "And whether ([read as] imm: the nn of the conditional particle in, \u0060whether\u0027, has been assimiliated with the extra m) We show you a part of that which We promise them, of chastisement, during your lifetime (the response of the conditional statement has been omitted, in other words [understand it as being], fa- dhk [\u0060then so shall it be\u0027]); or We take you [to Us], before chastising them; it is for you only to convey [the Message], your duty is only to deliver [the Message], and it is for Us to do the reckoning, when they finally come to Us, whereupon We shall requite them.",
  "Or is it that they, the people of Mecca, have not seen how We visit the land, [how] We target their land, diminishing it at its outlying regions?, by giving victory to the Prophet (s). And God judges, among His creatures as He will; there is none that can repel His judgement and He is swift at reckoning.",
  "And indeed those that were before them, of communities, plotted, against their prophets just as they plot against you; but to God belongs all plotting. And nor is their plotting like the plotting of God, for, exalted be He, He knows what every soul earns, and so its requital is prepared for it, and this is the ultimate plotting, since He brings it to them whence they are not aware. The disbeliever (the genus is meant here; a variant reading has kuffr [\u0060the disbelievers\u0027]) shall assuredly know for whom shall be the sequel of the [heavenly] Abode, that is, the praiseworthy sequel in the abode of the Hereafter: will it be theirs or that of the Prophet (s) and his Companions?",
  "And those who disbelieve say, to you: \u0060You have not been sent [by God]!\u0027 Say, to them: \u0060God suffices as a witness between me and you, to my truthfulness [as a messenger], and he who possesses knowledge of the Book\u0027, from among the Christian and Jewish believers. Meccan, except for the two verses 28 and 29, which are Medinese; it consists of 52, 54 or 55 verses.",
  "Alif lm r\u0027: God knows best what He means by these [letters]. This Qur\u0027n is, a Book We have revealed to you, O Muhammad (s), that you may bring forth mankind from darkness, [from] unbelief, into light, [into] faith, by the leave, by the command, of their Lord (il\u0027l-nr, \u0060into light\u0027, may be substituted by [the following il sirt]), to the path, the way, of the Mighty, the Victor, the Praised, the One who is [constantly] praised.",

  "And We have not sent any Messenger except with the tongue, with the language, of his people, that he might make [the Message] clear to them, that he might make them understand what he brings to them; God then sends astray whomever He will and He guides whomever He will; and He is the Mighty, in His kingdom, the Wise, in His actions.",
  "And verily We sent Moses with Our signs, the nine [signs], and We said to him: \u0060Bring forth your people, the Children of Israel, out of darkness, [out of] unbelief, into light, [into] faith, and remind them of the Days of God\u0027, of His graces. Surely in that, reminder, are signs for every man enduring, in obedience [to God], thankful, for [His] graces.",
  "And, mention, when Moses said to his people, \u0060Remember God\u0027s grace to you when He delivered you from the folk of Pharaoh, who were inflicting upon you a dreadful chastisement, and were slaughtering your sons, the new-born, and sparing, keeping alive, your women -- this was because some of the priests [of Egypt] had stated that a child born among the Israelites shall be the cause of the destruction of Pharaoh\u0027s kingdom; and in that, deliverance -- or [in that] chastisement -- was a tremendous trial, grace -- or [a tremendous] test -- from your Lord.",
  "And when your Lord proclaimed, [when] He made it known that: \u0022If you are thankful, for My graces, through affirmation of [My] Oneness and obedience [to Me], then assuredly I shall give you more; but if you are thankless, [if] you deny [the truth of] the grace, through disbelief and disobedience, then assuredly I shall chastise you -- as is indicated by [His following words] -- My chastisement is indeed severe\u0022 \u0027.",
  "And Moses said, to his people: \u0060If you are thankless, you and all who are on earth, lo! assuredly God is Independent, [without need] of His creatures, Praised\u0027, praiseworthy in what He does with them.",

None knows them save God. [This is] on account of their multitude. Their messengers brought them clear signs, with lucid arguments demonstrating their truthfulness; but they, that is, the communities, thrust their hands into their mouths, to bite on them, out of extreme spite, and said, \u0060Lo! we disbelieve in that wherewith you have been sent, according to what you claim, and lo! we are in grave doubt concerning that to which you call us\u0027, [doubt] creating [great] uncertainty.",
  "Their messengers said, \u0060Can there be doubt concerning God (an interrogative meant as a denial), in other words, there can be no doubt concerning His Oneness, given the manifest proofs of it, the Originator, the Creator, of the heavens and the earth? He calls you, to obedience of Him, so that He might forgive you your sins (min dhunbikum: min is extra, since through submission [to the One God] all that may have been committed previously is forgiven (or else it [min, \u0060some of\u0027] is partitive, intended to state that [forgiveness] which is due to [God\u0027s] servants) and defer you, without chastisement, to an appointed term\u0027, the term of death. They said, \u0060You are but mortals like us, desiring to bar us from that which our fathers used to worship, in the way of idols. So bring us a clear warrant\u0027, a manifest argument demonstrating your truthfulness.",
  "Their messengers said to them, \u0060We are but mortals like you, as you have said; but God is gracious to whomever He will of His servants, by way of [assigning] prophethood. And it is not ours to bring you any warrant save by the leave of God, by His command, for we are servants, enthralled; and in God let believers put their trust, [let them] have confidence in Him.",

So do not blame me, but blame yourselves, for having responded to me. I cannot heed your [distress] call, [I cannot] bring aid to you, nor can you heed mine (read bi-musrikhiyya or bi-musrikh). Lo! I disbelieved in your making me an associate of God formerly\u0027, during life on earth. God, exalted be He, says: Truly for the evildoers, the disbelievers, there shall be a painful chastisement.",

  "Have you not seen, observed, those who exchanged God\u0027s grace, that is, the thanks [due] for it, for unthankfulness -- these were the disbelievers of Quraysh -- and who, by leading them astray, caused their people to take up residence in the Abode of Ruin?",

  "And verily they plotted, against the Prophet (s), their plot -- when they desired to kill him, or detain him [in his house] or banish him -- but their plotting is with God, that is to say, knowledge or the requital thereof [is with God], and their plotting, even though it be great, was not such whereby mountains should be moved, meaning that it is not of any importance, but that they are only harming themselves thereby. It is said that the use of \u0060mountains\u0027 here is meant to be literal; alternatively, it is also said [to be a reference to] the laws of Islam, which are likened to these [mountains] in the way that they are established and fixed (a variant reading has la-tazlu [instead of li-tazla], with in softened [from inna, \u0060verily\u0027], in which case the intended meaning is that [the extent of] their plotting is great. It is said that \u0060plotting\u0027 here is [actually a reference to] their unbelief. This second [reading] is consonant with [God\u0027s saying]: Whereby the heavens are almost torn and the earth split asunder and the mountains fall crashing [Q. 19:90]; according to the former [reading], however, one should read it as [if it were] wa-m kna, and [their plotting] was not such ...).",
  "So do not suppose that God will fail [to keep] His promise, of victory, to His messengers. Truly God is Mighty, Victor, nothing able to escape Him, Lord of Retribution, against those who disobey Him.",
  "And mention, the day when the earth will be changed to other than the earth and the heavens, namely, the Day of Resurrection: mankind shall be gathered onto a white clear earth, as [reported] in the hadth of the two Shaykhs [al-Bukhr and Muslim]. Muslim relates the following hadth: \u0060The Prophet (s) was asked, \u0022Where will people be on that day?\u0022 He said, \u0022On the Bridge (sirt)\u0022 \u0027; and they shall come forth, they shall exit from [their] graves, to God, the One, the Almighty.",
  "And you shall see, O Muhammad (s), the sinners, the disbelievers, on that day coupled, chained together with their [individual] devils, in chains, manacles or collars,",
  "their shirts [made] of pitch, because it ignites fire more intensely, and their faces are engulfed by the Fire,",
  "that God may requite (li-yajziya is semantically connected to [the verb] baraz, \u0060they shall come forth\u0027) every soul for what it has earned, of good and evil. Truly God is swift at reckoning -- He shall reckon with all creatures in about half a day of the days of this world, as one hadth states to that effect.",
  "This, Qur\u0027n, is a Proclamation for mankind, in other words, it was revealed in order to proclaim to them, and so that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know, by way of the arguments contained in it, that He, namely, God, is One God, and that people of pith, possessors of intellect, may remember (yadhdhakkara: the original t\u0027 [of yatadhakkara] has been assimilated with the dhl), [that they] may be admonished. Meccan, consisting of 99 verses.",
  "Alif lm r\u0027: God knows best what He means by these [letters]. Those -- these verses -- are the verses of the Book, the Qur\u0027n (ytu\u0027l-kitbi: this annexation functions in the sense of min, \u0060from\u0027) and of a manifest Qur\u0027n, one that makes evident what is truth and what is falsehood (wa-qur\u0027nin mubnin is [made up of] a supplement with an added adjectival qualification).",
  "It may be that (read rubbam or rubam) those who disbelieve, on the Day of Resurrection, when they witness their predicament and that of the Muslims, will wish that they had been muslims (rubba here is used to indicate \u0060many\u0027, since many of them will wish this; but it is also said to indicate \u0060few\u0027, since they will be so stupefied by the terrors that they will not come out of their stupor to wish such a thing, except on a few occasions:",
  "Leave them, the disbelievers, O Muhammad (s), to eat and to enjoy, this world of theirs, and that they be diverted, distracted, by hope, of a long life and other [such] matters, [that keep them] away from faith, for they will come to know, the sequel of their affair -- this was [revealed] before the command to fight [them].",
  "And We did not destroy any town (min qaryatin: min is extra), meaning, its inhabitants, but that it had a known decree, a [pre-]determined term, after which it would be destroyed.",
  "No community (min ummatin: min is extra) can outstrip its [predetermined] term nor can they [seek to] delay it, [nor can they] put it off.",
  "And they, that is, the disbelievers of Mecca, say, to the Prophet (s): \u0060O you, to whom the Remembrance, the Qur\u0027n -- as you claim -- has been revealed, lo! you are indeed possessed!",
  "Why do you not bring us the angels, if you are of the truthful?\u0027, in saying that you are a prophet and that this Qur\u0027n is from God.",
  "God, exalted be He, says: The angels do not descend (tanazzalu: one of the two t\u0027 letters [of tatanazzalu] has been omitted) save with the truth, with the chastisement; and then, that is, upon the descent of the angels with the chastisement, they [the disbelievers] would not be reprieved, [would not] be granted respite.",
  "Verily it is We (nahnu emphasises the subject of inna, or [functions as] a separating pronoun) Who have revealed the Remembrance, the Qur\u0027n, and assuredly We will preserve it, against substitution, distortion, additions and omissions.",
  "And verily We sent before you, messengers, to former factions, sects.",
  "And never did a messenger come to them but that they mocked him, in the same way that your people have mocked you -- this is meant to comfort the Prophet (s).",
  "Thus We cause it to find its way, in other words, in the same way that We have caused denial to enter the hearts of those [individuals], We cause it to enter, into the hearts of the sinners, that is, the disbelievers of Mecca.",
  "They do not believe in him, in the Prophet (s), even though the example of the men of old has already gone before, that is, the way of God [in dealing] with them [those of old], by chastising them for denying [the truthfulness of] their prophets: those [Meccans] are like these former.",
  "And even if We were to open for them a gate from the heaven, and they were to continue ascending through it, the gate,",
  "they would say, \u0060It is merely that our eyes have been dazzled, they have been shut. Nay, we are a folk bewitched!\u0027, imagining this.",
  "And verily We have placed in the heaven constellations, twelve [of them]: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo (al-sunbula), Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces, which are the mansions of the seven orbiting planets: Mars rules Aries and Scorpio, Venus: Taurus and Libra, Mercury: Gemini and Virgo, the Moon: Cancer, the Sun: Leo, Jupiter: Sagittarius and Pisces, and Saturn: Capricorn and Aquarius; and We have adorned it, with [these] planets, for beholders;",
  "and We have guarded them, with meteors, from every outcast devil;",
  "except the one who listens by stealth -- he is pursued by a clear flame, a shining meteor that burns him, or pierces him or drives him insane.",
  "And the earth We have stretched it out, spread it flat, and cast therein firm mountains, lest it should sway beneath its inhabitants, and caused to grow therein every kind of balanced thing, [every kind of thing] known and determined.",
  "And We have made for you therein [means of] livelihood (read ma\u0060yish), such as fruits and grains, and, We have made [this] for you, those for whom you do not provide, such as servants, [crawling] creatures and cattle; it is God Who provides for them.",
  "And there is not a thing but that the stores thereof, the keys to its stores, are with Us, and We do not send it down except in a known measure, according to the benefits [of all creatures].",
  "And We send the winds as fertilisers, to fertilise the clouds, whereupon they fill up with water, and send down out of the heaven, [out of] the clouds, water, rain, so that We give it to you to drink, for you are not the storers thereof, that is, the stores thereof are not in your control.",
  "Indeed it is We Who give life and bring death, and We are the heirs, Who shall endure, inheriting all creation.",
  "And verily We know the predecessors among you, that is, those creatures from Adam who have already passed, and verily We know the successors, those who will come afterwards, until the Day of Resurrection.",
  "And it is indeed your Lord Who will gather them, lo! He is Wise, in His actions, Knower, of His creatures.",
  "And verily We created man, Adam, out of a dry [clinking] clay, that gives off a clinking sound when it is tapped, of malleable mud, black [mud].",
  "And the jnn, the father of the jinn, namely, Ibls, We created beforehand -- that is, before the creation of Adam -- out of the permeative fire, a smokeless fire that can escape through openings.",
  "And, mention, when your Lord said to the angels, \u0060Indeed I am going to create a mortal out of a dry clay [drawn] from a malleable mud.",
  "So, when I have proportioned him, completed him, and breathed, caused to flow, of My Spirit in him, so that he becomes a living thing -- the annexation of \u0060the Spirit\u0027 to him is a conferring of honour upon Adam -- fall down in prostration before him!\u0027, a prostration [meant as an act] of salutation by bowing.",
  "And so the angels prostrated, all of them together (kulluhum ajma\u0060n contains two elements of emphasis),",
  "except Ibls, the father of the jinn -- he was [standing] among the angels: he refused to be among those prostrating.",
  "He, [God] exalted be He: \u0060O Ibls what is wrong with you, what prevents you, that you are not among those prostrating?\u0027",
  "Said he, \u0060I was not about to prostrate myself, I should not prostrate myself, before a mortal whom You have created out of a dry clay [drawn] from malleable mud\u0027.",
  "Said He, \u0060Then be gone from hence, that is, from the Garden -- but it is also said, from the heavens -- for you are indeed accursed, outcast.",
  "And indeed the curse shall rest upon you until the Day of Judgement\u0027, [the Day] of Requital.",
  "Said he, \u0060My Lord! Reprieve me until the day when they, mankind, shall be resurrected\u0027.",
  "Said He, \u0060Then lo! you are of those reprieved,",
  "until the day of the known time\u0027, the time of [the blowing of] the First Trumpet.",
  "Said he, \u0060My Lord, because You have lead me astray (bi-m, \u0060because\u0027, the bi- is for oaths, the response for which is [what follows]) I shall adorn for them [evil acts], acts of disobedience, in the earth and I shall lead them astray, all of them;",
  "except those servants of Yours who are sincerely devoted [to You]\u0027, namely, believers.",
  "He, [God] exalted be He, said, \u0060This is a straight path [leading] to Me,",
  "in other words, truly over My servants, that is, believers, you shall have no warrant, [no] power, except those who follow you from among the perverse, the disbelievers.",
  "And truly Hell shall be their tryst, all of them, that is, all those who follow you, shall be with you [in Hell].",
  "It has seven gates, [seven] layers -- to each gate, therein, belongs an appointed portion, lot, of them.",
  "Truly the God-fearing shall be amidst gardens, orchards, and springs\u0027, flowing through them.",
  "And it shall be said to them: \u0060Enter them in peace, that is, safe from all danger -- or [it means enter] with [the greeting of] \u0060Peace!\u0027, in other words: say, \u0060Peace\u0027 and then enter, secure!\u0027, from all terror.",
  "And We remove whatever rancour, spite, may be in their breasts. As brethren (ikhwnan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to them), [they shall recline] upon couches, facing one another (mutaqbiln is also a circumstantial qualifier), in other words, they do not look upon each other\u0027s backs, because the couches revolve with them in them.",
  "No toil, [no] weariness, will touch them, nor will they be expelled from thence, ever.",
  "Tell, inform, O Muhammad (s), My servants that verily I am the Forgiving, of believers, the Merciful, to them,",
  "and that My chastisement, of those who are disobedient, is the painful chastisement.",
  "And tell them of the guests of Abraham, that is, the angels -- there were twelve, ten or three of them, among them Gabriel;",
  "[how] when they entered unto him, and said, \u0060Peace!\u0027, that is, [they said] this very word (salm). He, Abraham, said, after having offered them food which they did not eat: \u0060Lo! we are afraid of you\u0027.",
  "They said, \u0060Do not be afraid; lo!, we, are the messengers of your Lord [sent to], give you good tidings of a knowledgeable boy\u0027, one very knowledgeable [boy], namely, Isaac -- as we mentioned in srat Hd [Q. 11:69].",
  "He said, \u0060Do you give me good tidings, of a boy, when old age has befallen me?\u0027 (\u0060al an massaniya l-kibaru is a circumstantial qualifier), in other words, despite the fact of its having befallen me? So, of what, thing, do you give me good tidings?\u0027 (an interrogative meant to indicate amazement).",
  "They said, \u0060We give you good tidings in truth, sincerely; so do not be of the despairing\u0027, the despondent.",
  "He said, \u0060And who -- in other words, no one -- despairs (read yaqnitu or yaqnatu) of the mercy of his Lord, save those who are astray?\u0027, [save] disbelievers.",
  "He said, \u0060So what is your business, O you who have been sent [by God]?\u0027",
  "They said, \u0060We have been sent to a sinning folk, a disbelieving [folk], namely, the people of Lot, in order to destroy them;",
  "[all] except the family of Lot; indeed we shall save them, all of them, because of their faith,",
  "except his wife -- We have decreed that she indeed should be of those who will remain behind\u0027, [of] those who will stay behind in the chastisement, because of her unbelief.",
  "And when those who had been sent [by God] came to the family of Lot, that is, to Lot [himself],",
  "he said, to them, \u0060Indeed you are strangers\u0027, that is, I do not know you.",
  "They said, \u0060Rather, we have come to you because of that which they, your people, used to doubt, namely, the chastisement.",
  "And we have brought you the Truth and indeed we speak truthfully, in what we say.",
  "So travel with your family in a portion of the night and follow their rear, walk behind them; and let none of you turn round, lest he see the dreadful nature of that [punishment] which will be sent down on them, and go whither you are commanded\u0027, namely, [to] Syria.",
  "And We conveyed, We revealed, to him the matter, which was, that these [sinners] was to be eradicated by morning (musbihn is a circumstantial qualifier,), in other words, their annihilation will take place in the morning.",
  "And then came the people of the city, the city of Sodom, that is, the people of Lot, upon being told that there were handsome clean-shaven individuals -- namely, the angels -- in the house of Lot, rejoicing (yastabshirn is a circumstantial qualifier), desiring to commit an abomination with them.",
  "He, Lot, said, \u0060Lo! these are my guests, so do not disgrace me;",
  "and fear God, and do not humiliate me\u0027, by seeking them to commit an abomination with them.",
  "They said, \u0060Have we not forbidden you from [entertaining] anyone?\u0027, from offering them hospitality?",
  "He said, \u0060These here are my daughters, if you must be doing\u0027, what you desire [to do] in the way of satisfying your lust, then marry them. God, exalted be He, says:",
  "By your life -- this is an address to the Prophet (s) -- in their drunkenness they were bewildered, hesitant.",
  "Then the Cry, the Cry of Gabriel, seized them at sunrise.",
  "And We made their, that is, their cities\u0027, topmost part their nethermost, by Gabriel\u0027s raising them [the cities] to the heaven and dropping them face down onto the earth, and We rained on them stones of baked clay, clay baked in fire.",
  "Indeed in that, which is mentioned, there are signs, indications of God\u0027s Oneness, for those who take note, [those who] observe and take heed.",
  "And indeed they, that is, the cities of the people of Lot, are on a road that [still] remains, Quraysh\u0027s route to Syria, [one] not yet effaced: so why do they not take heed from their example?",
  "There is indeed a sign, a lesson, in that for believers.",
  "And certainly (in has been softened, in other words [understand it as being] innahu) the dwellers in the wood, a huddle of trees near Midian -- these were the people of [the prophet] Shu\u0060ayb -- were evildoers, for denying Shu\u0060ayb.",
  "So We exacted retribution from them, by destroying them through extreme heat. And certainly both of them, that is, the cities of the people of Lot and those of [the dwellers in] the wood, are upon a open road, plain [to see]: so will you not take heed from their example, O people of Mecca?",
  "And verily the dwellers in al-Hijr -- a valley between Medina and Syria -- namely, [the tribe of] Thamd, denied those who had been sent [by God], when they denied [the prophet] Slih, as this constituted a denial of the other messengers, since they all shared the fact that they came with [the Message proclaiming] the Oneness of God.",
  "And We brought them Our signs, by way of the she-camel [of Slih], but they were averse [to them], refusing to reflect on them.",
  "And they used to hew out dwellings from the mountains, feeling secure.",
  "But the Cry seized them in the morning.",
  "And so that which they used to count as gain, in the way of building fortresses and amassing riches, did not avail, [did not] protect, them, from the chastisement.",
  "We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save with the Truth. And truly the Hour shall come, without doubt, whereupon every person will be requited according to his deeds. So be forgiving, O Muhammad (s), to your people, with gracious forgiveness: turn away from them without [any feeling of] anxiety -- this was abrogated by the \u0060sword\u0027 verse [Q. 9:5].",
  "Truly your Lord, He is the Creator, of everything, the Knowing, of everything.",
  "And verily We have given you seven of the oft-repeated [verses] -- the Prophet (s) said that this meant [srat] al-Ftiha, as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim], since it is repeated in every unit of prayer (rak\u0060a) -- and the great Qur\u0027n.",
  "Do not extend your glance toward that which We have given different groups of them to enjoy, and do not grieve for them, should they not believe, and lower your wing, temper your nature, for the believers.",
  "And say: \u0060Indeed, I am the warner, of God\u0027s chastisement, lest it be sent down on you, the clear [warner], clear in [his] warning.",
  "Even as We sent down, chastisement, on those who make division, the Jews and the Christians,",
  "those who have reduced the Recitation, namely, those scriptures revealed to them, to parts, believing in some and disbelieving in others. It is [alternatively] said that the individuals meant here were those who \u0060divided up\u0027 among themselves the roads to Mecca, barring people from Islam. Some of them said that the Qur\u0027n was sorcery, some that it was soothsaying, and others that it was poetry.",
  "By your Lord, We shall question them all -- a questioning involving rebuke --",
  "about what they used to do.",
  "So proclaim, O Muhammad (s), what you have been commanded, to [proclaim], in other words, declare it openly and carry it out, and turn away from the idolaters -- this was [revealed] before the command to struggle [against the idolaters].",
  "Indeed We have sufficed you against the mockers, [who mocked] you, by Our having destroyed each one of them through some harm, and these were: al-Wald b. al-Mughra, al-\u0060s b. W\u0027il, \u0060Udayy b. Qays, al-Aswad b. al-Muttalib and al-Aswad b. \u0060Abd Yaghth,",
  "those [mockers] who set up besides God another god: (this [entire clause] is an adjectival qualification; but it is also said to be the subject, and because there is an implicit conditional meaning [in the above- mentioned clause], the [particle] f\u0027 has been inserted into the predicate, which is [the following]) soon they will know, the sequel of their affair.",
  "And verily (wa-laqad is for confirmation) We know that your breast is [at times] oppressed by what they say, in the way of mockery and denial.",
  "So glorify, intimately [repeating], the praise of your Lord, in other words, say subhna\u0027Llhi wa-bi-hamdihi -- and be of those who prostrate themselves, those who pray;",
  "and worship your Lord until Certainty -- Death -- comes to you. Meccan, except for the last three verses, which are Medinese; it consists of 128 verses, revealed after [srat] al-Kahf.",
  "When the idolaters found chastisement slow in coming, the following was revealed: God\u0027s commandment has come, that is, the Hour [has come] ([this verb] at is in the past tense because it means that [the event therein described] will come to pass) in other words, it [God\u0027s commandment] is close at hand, so do not seek to hasten it, do not demand it before its [due] time, for it will come to pass without doubt. Glory be to Him -- an affirmation of His transcendence -- and exalted be He above what they associate, with Him, in the way of others.",
  "He sends down the angels, namely, Gabriel, with the Spirit, with the Revelation, of His command, by His will, to whomever He will of His servants, and these are the prophets, [saying] that (an is explicative): Warn, threaten the disbelievers with chastisement and make them aware, that there is no God save Me: so fear Me, fear Me.",
  "He created the heavens and the earth with the Truth, that is, with the purpose of [manifesting] truth. Exalted be He above what they associate, with Him in the way of idols.",
  "He created man from a drop of fluid, of sperm, until He makes him strong and tough, yet behold! he is disputatious, extremely quarrelsome, openly, making this [disputatiousness] clear in his rejection of resurrection, contending: Who shall revive the bones when they are decayed? [Q. 36:78].",
  "And the cattle, camels, cows and sheep (al-an\u0060ma, \u0060cattle\u0027, is in the accusative because of the implied verb [governing it], as explained by [the following words, khalaqah lakum]), He created them for you, [you being] included among the number of mankind. In them there is warmth, that by which you keep warm in the way of clothes and garments, [taken] from their hairs and wools, as well as [other] uses, such as [their] offspring, milk and for you to ride, and of them you eat (the adverbial clause [wa-minh, \u0060of them\u0027] precedes [the verb] for the purpose of [establishing harmony with] the end-rhyme [of the Qur\u0027nic verse]);",
  "and for you there is in them beauty, adornment, when you bring them [home] to rest, [when you] return them to their resting places in the evening, and when you drive them forth to pasture, when you bring them out to the grazing pastures in the morning.",
  "And they bear your burdens, your baggage, to a land which you could not reach, without being on camel- back, save with great trouble to yourselves, [save by] straining them. Indeed your Lord is Gentle, Merciful, to you, in having created these for you.",
  "And, He created, horses and mules and asses, that you may ride them, and for adornment (wa-znatan is an object denoting reason; the use of both of these reasons [\u0060to ride\u0027 and \u0060for adornment\u0027] as illustrations of [God\u0027s] graces does not preclude that they may have been created for other purposes, such as for consumption in the case of horses -- which is established [as lawful] by a hadth in both Sahhs [of Bukhr and Muslim]); and He creates what you do not know, of marvelous and strange things.",
  "And God\u0027s is the direction of the way, that is, to point out the straight path, and some of them, that is, the paths, are deviant, swerving away from straightness. And had He willed, to guide you, He would have guided you, to seek the way, all, so that you would be [rightly] guided of your own choice.",
  "He it is Who sends down water from the heaven, whence you have drink, for you to drink, and whence are trees, which grow because of this [water], whereat you let your animals graze.",
  "With it He makes the crops grow for you, and olives and date-palms and vines and all kinds of fruit. Surely in that, which is mentioned, there is a sign, indicating His Oneness, exalted He be, for people who reflect, upon His handiwork and therefore believe.",
  "And He disposed for you the night and the day and the sun (wa\u0027l-shamsa, read in the accusative as a supplement to what precedes it; or read wa\u0027l-shamsu in the nominative as a subject [of a new sentence]) and the moon and the stars (also read both ways) are disposed (musakhkhartin, read in the accusative as a circumstantial qualifier, or in the nominative [musakhkhartun] as a predicate) by His command, by His will. Surely in that there are signs for people who understand, [a people] who reflect.",
  "And, He has disposed for you, whatever He has created for you in the earth, of animals, plants and otherwise, diverse in hue, such as red, yellow, green and otherwise. Surely in that there is a sign for people who remember, [a people who] are admonished.",
  "And He it is Who disposed the sea, [He it is Who] subdued it, that it might be sailed upon and dived in, that you may eat from it fresh meat, that is, fish, and bring forth from it ornaments which you wear, namely, pearls and coral.

  "Is He then Who creates -- namely, God -- as he who does not create, namely, idols, so that you associate them with Him in worship? No. Will you not then remember, this, and so become believers?",
  "And if you were to count God\u0027s grace you could never reckon it, number it precisely, let alone be able to give thanks for it. Indeed God is Forgiving, Merciful, since He bestows graces upon you despite your shortcomings and your [acts of] disobedience.",
  "And God knows what you keep secret and what you disclose.",
  "And those whom you invoke (tad\u0060na, or read yad\u0060una \u0060they invoke\u0027) besides God, namely, the idols, do not create anything, but are themselves created, fashioned from stones and other [materials].",
  "They are dead, possessing no life (amwtun, \u0060dead\u0027, is a second predicate), not living (an emphasis), and they, the idols, are not aware when, is the time [in which], they shall be raised, that is, creatures: so how can they be worshipped? For, only the Creator, the Living, the Knower of the Unseen can be a God.",
  "Your God, the One deserving of your worship, is One God, without [any] equal in [terms of] His essence or His attributes, and this is God, exalted He be.

  "Without doubt, verily, God knows what they keep secret and what they disclose, and will requite them for it. Indeed He does not love the arrogant, meaning, He will punish them.",
  "The following was revealed regarding al-Nadr b. al-Hrith: And when it is said to them, \u0060What is it (m is an interrogative particle; dh is a relative particle) that your Lord has revealed?\u0027, to Muhammad (s), they say, [that] these [revelations] are, \u0060fables, lies, of the ancients\u0027, in order to lead people astray.",
  "That they may bear, at the conclusion of the matter, their burdens, their sins, complete, none of them expunged, on the Day of Resurrection and also, [bear] some, of the burdens of those whom they lead astray without any knowledge, because they summoned them to error and they [the latter] followed them, and thus both share in the sin. How evil, awful, is the burden they bear, this load [of sins] of theirs which they carry.",
  "Those before them had indeed plotted, [those] such as Nimrod -- he built a lofty tower that he might ascend through it to the heavens and wage war against its inhabitants; then God came at, He aimed at, their edifice from the foundations, from the base, unleashing against it winds and earthquake, which demolished it; and so the roof collapsed upon them from above them, that is, while they were beneath it, and the chastisement came upon them whence they were not aware, from a direction which would not have occurred to them: [alternatively] it is said that this [description] is a simile for [demonstrating] the thwarting of that which they had settled on in the way of plots against [God\u0027s] messengers.",
  "Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them, humiliate them, and He, God, will say, to them by the tongues of the angels, in rebuke: \u0060Where are those associates of Mine, as you [were wont to] claim, concerning whom, for whose sake, you used to make breaches?\u0027, you used to opposed the believers. Those who were given knowledge, from among the prophets and believers, will say, \u0060Truly disgrace on this day, as well as misfortune, are for the disbelievers -- they say this rejoicing at their [the disbelievers\u0027] misfortune --",
  "those whom the angels take [in death] (read [feminine person] tatawaffhum or [masculine] yatawaffhum) while they are wronging themselves\u0027, through disbelief. Then they will offer submission, becoming compliant and submitting themselves [to belief in God] upon death, saying: \u0060We were not doing any evil\u0027, [any] associating others with God, whereat the angels say: \u0060Nay! Surely God is Knower of what you used to do\u0027, and will requite you for it.",
  "And it will also be said to them: So enter the gates of Hell, to abide therein! Evil indeed is the lodging, the abode, of the arrogant.",
  "And it is said to those who fear, idolatry, \u0060What has your Lord revealed?\u0027 They will say, \u0060Good! For those who were virtuous, by [embracing] faith, in this world, there will be a virtuous [reward], namely, a goodly life; and truly the abode of the Hereafter, that is, Paradise, is better, than the world and all that is in it. God says [the following] regarding it: And truly excellent is the abode of the God-fearing, it [the Hereafter] is.",
  "Gardens of Eden, as a [place of] residence (janntu \u0060Adnin is a subject, the predicate of which is [what follows]) which they will enter, [Gardens] underneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall have whatever they wish. So, [with such] a reward, God rewards the God-fearing,",
  "those whom (alladhna is a description) the angels take away [in death] while they are goodly, pure of any unbelief, saying, to them upon death: \u0060Peace be on you!, and it is said to them in the Hereafter: Enter Paradise because of what you used to do\u0027.",
  "Do they, the disbelievers, await anything but that the angels should come to them (read [feminine person] ta\u0027thim or [masculine] ya\u0027thim) to seize their spirits, or that there should come your Lord\u0027s command?, chastisement, or the resurrection that entails it. So, just as these have done, did those before them, from among the [former] communities: they denied their messengers and were therefore destroyed. And God did not wrong them, destroying them for no sin, but they used to wrong themselves, through disbelief.",
  "So that the evils of what they did smote them, that is, the requital of these [evil things smote them], and there besieged, it was sent down [against], them that which they used to mock, namely, the chastisement.",
  "And the idolaters, from among the Meccans, say, \u0060Had God willed we would not have worshipped anything besides Him -- neither we, nor our fathers -- nor would we have deemed anything sacred besides Him\u0027, in the way of those [camels] called bahras and s\u0027iba. In other words, our idolatry and our deeming [these animals] sacred are [effected] by His will; therefore He must be satisfied with this. God, exalted He be, says: So did those before them, that is, they denied their messengers regarding that which they [the messengers] brought them. Yet are messengers charged with anything save plain conveyance [of the Message]? It is not their duty to guide.",
  "And verily We sent forth among every community a messenger, just as We have sent you forth among these [Meccans], [to say]: \u0060Worship God, profess [belief in] His Oneness, and shun false deities\u0027, graven images, and do not worship them. Then among them were some whom God guided, and they believed, and among them were some who deserved to be in error, according to God\u0027s knowledge, and so they did not believe. So travel, O disbelievers of Mecca, in the land and observe the nature of the consequence of those who denied, their messengers, in that they were destroyed.",
  "If you, O Muhammad (s), are eager for them to be guided, when God has already made them go astray, you will not be able to achieve this: For God does not guide (read passive l yuhd [?], or active l yahd) he whom He has [already] sent astray, he whom He desires to send astray, and they will have no helpers, [no] protectors from God\u0027s chastisement.",
  "And they swear by God their most earnest oaths, in other words, with their utmost earnestness therein, that God will not resurrect the dead. God, exalted be He, says: Nay, He will resurrect them: it is a promise binding upon Him (both wa\u0060dan and haqqan are verbal nouns, used for emphasis, and are in the accusative because of the verbal actions implicit in them; in other words, He promised that and made it a binding truth) but most people, that is, the people of Mecca, do not know, that.",
  "That He may make clear to them (li-yubayyina is semantically connected to an implied yab\u0060athuhum, \u0060He will resurrect them\u0027) what they differ, with believers, in, of matters of religion, by punishing them and rewarding the believers, and that the disbelievers may know that they were liars, when they denied the Resurrection.",
  "All that We say to a thing, when We will it, that is, when We will that it come into existence (qawlun is a subject, the predicate of which is [what follows]) is to say to it \u0060Be,\u0027 and it is, in other words, and that [thing] is (a variant reading [for fa-yaknu] has fa-yakna as a supplement to naqla). The verse is intended as an affirmation of the power [of God] to resurrect.",
  "And those who emigrated for God\u0027s cause, to establish His religion, after they had been wronged, through harm, [those] from among the people of Mecca -- these were the Prophet (s) and his Companions -- truly We shall lodge them in this world in a goodly lodging, namely, Medina, and the reward of the Hereafter, that is, Paradise, is surely greater, grander, did they but know, that is, the disbelievers -- or those who stayed behind and did not emigrate -- [did they but know] the honour that belongs to emigrants, they would have followed them.",
  "They are, those who endure, the harm inflicted by the idolaters and [endure] the emigration in order to make manifest the religion, and put their trust in their Lord, so that He provides for them whence they do not reckon.",
  "And We did not send before you anything other than men, to whom We revealed, and [sent] not angels: \u0060So ask the followers of the Remembrance, those knowledgeable in the Torah and the Gospels; if you do not know\u0027, that, then they know it, and you are more likely to believe them than the believers are to believe Muhammad (s),",
  "[We sent them] with clear signs (bi\u0027l-bayyint is semantically connected to an omitted [verb]), namely, We sent them with clear arguments, and the Books and We have revealed to you the Remembrance, the Qur\u0027n, that you may make clear to mankind what has been revealed to them, therein, in the way of [what is] lawful and unlawful, and that perhaps they might reflect, upon this and take heed.",
  "Do they feel secure, those who have schemed evil, schemes against the Prophet (s) at the Council Assembly, [schemes] such as detaining him, killing him or banishing him, as mentioned in [srat] al-Anfl [Q. 8:30], that God will not cause the earth to swallow them, as [God did] with Qrn [Q. 28:81], or that the chastisement will not come upon them whence they are not aware of?, that is, in a way which would not occur to them. Indeed, they were destroyed at Badr even though they had never anticipated it.",
  "Or that He will not seize them in their going to and fro, during their travels for commerce, whereupon they will not be able to escape?, [whereupon] they will not be able to elude the chastisement.",
  "Or that He will not seize them amid [growing] fear?, [amid] a gradual diminishing [of their numbers] little by little, until all are destroyed (\u0060al takhawwufin is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb [God] or the object). Indeed then your Lord is Gentle, Merciful, insofar as He does not hasten for them their punishment.",
  "Or have they not observed the things which God has created, which cast a shadow, such as trees or a mountain, how their shadows incline to the right and to the left (sham\u0027il is the plural of shiml), in other words, towards both sides, at the beginning of the day and at its end, prostrating to God (sujjadan is a circumstantial qualifier), that is to say, subservient to Him with respect to what is required of them, and [how] they, the shadows, are subject?, humbled: they [the shadows] are likened to rational beings [in this description].",
  "And to God prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of living creatures, that is, [of] every single thing that moves thereupon; in other words, to Him it [everything] is subservient in terms of what is required of it -- most of what is given [by way of example] is non-rational, since these are [the more] numerous -- and the angels [also prostrate] -- these are singled out for mention because of their merit -- and they are not arrogant, they do [not] disdain to worship Him.",
  "They, that is, the angels, fear (yakhfna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person governing [the verb] yastakbirna, \u0060they are [not] arrogant\u0027) their Lord from above them (min fawqihim is a circumstantial qualifier referring to [the suffixed pronoun] -hum [of fawqihim]) in other words, [they fear their Lord], being High above them with the power to subjugate, and they do what they are commanded, to [do].",
  "And God has said: \u0060Do not choose two gods (ithnayn is for emphasis). Truly there is only One God -- He has added this [statement] to affirm [His] Divinity and Oneness -- so be in awe of Me [alone]\u0027: fear Me, to the exclusion of anyone else -- herein is a shift from the third person [to the first].",
  "And to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants. And to Him belongs the religion, the obedience, that endures, the [one] everlasting (wsiban, is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-dn, \u0060the religion\u0027, and is operated by the sense of the adverbial clause). Will you then fear any other than God?, when He is the True God, other than Whom there is no god (the interrogative is a [statement of] rejection and rebuke).",
  "Whatever grace you have, it is from God, none but He brings it (m, \u0060whatever\u0027, is either a conditional or relative [particle]). Then when misfortune, poverty or illness, befalls you, to Him you cry for help, [to Him] you raise your voices with pleas for help and supplications, and you do not call upon any other than Him.",
  "Then when He has rid you of the misfortune, behold, a group of you attribute partners to their Lord,",
  "in order to deny that, grace, which We have given them. So enjoy, that consent of yours to worship idols (an imperative meant as a threat): for soon you shall know, the consequence of this.",
  "And they, that is, the idolaters, assign, to what they do not know, that they cause harm and cannot benefit [them] -- namely, the idols -- a portion of that which We have provided them with, of crops and cattle, saying that \u0060this is for God and this is for our partners\u0027. By God, you will indeed be questioned (a questioning of rebuke; there is a shift herein from the third [to the second] person) about what you used to fabricate, against God, such as [claiming] that He commanded you to [do] this.",
  "And they assign to God daughters, by claiming that the angels are the daughters of God -- Be He glorified! -- a declaration that He is [exalted] above that which they claim -- while they will have what they desire, namely, sons (the status of this sentence is either independent [nominative], or that of an [accusative] object of [the verb] yaj\u0060alna, \u0060they assign\u0027). The meaning is that to Him they assign daughters, to whom they are averse, when [in any case] He is [exalted] beyond having offspring, while to themselves they assign sons, of their own choosing, so that the best is theirs exclusively -- like where God says, Now, ask them: are daughters to be for your Lord, while sons are to be for them? [Q. 37:149].",
  "And when one of them is given the tidings of a girl, that will be born to him, his face becomes darkened, transformed like that of one [suddenly] struck by grief, and he chokes inwardly, filled with anguish: so how is it that daughters are attributed to Him, exalted be He?",
  "He hides, disappearing, from people, that is, [from] his people, out of distress at the tidings given to him, fearing mockery, unsure what to do with it [the newborn]: shall he retain it -- refrain from killing it -- in humiliation, [enduring] shame and disgrace, or trample into the dust, by burying it alive. Verily wretched is what they judge, [evil is] this judgement of theirs, in which they ascribe to their Creator [that His are the] daughters, who have such a [lowly] status in their eyes.",
  "For those who do not believe in the Hereafter, namely, [for] the disbelievers, there is an evil description, in other words, [theirs is] the most evil attribute, meaning, the most vile, which is their burying alive of [newborn] girls, despite the fact that they are needed for the purposes of marriage; and the loftiest description belongs to God, [His is] the attribute most sublime, namely, that there is no god except Him. And He is the Mighty, in His kingdom, the Wise, in His creation.",
  "And if God were to take mankind to task for their wrongdoing, [wrongdoing] through acts of disobedience, He would not leave upon it, that is, [upon] the earth, any living being, any single [living] thing moving upon it; but He gives them respite until an appointed term; and when their term comes they will not defer, from it, by a single hour nor advance, it.",
  "Still, they assign to God what they dislike, for themselves -- such as daughters, partners in power, and the mistreatment of messengers. And their tongues, despite this, relate, tell, the lie, which is, that theirs will be the best reward, with God, namely, Paradise, as He [God] states [in their words elsewhere]: \u0060And in case I am returned to my Lord, I will indeed have the best reward with Him\u0027 [Q. 41:50]. But God, exalted be He, says: Without any doubt -- verily -- theirs shall be the Fire and they shall be abandoned therein, or [it, mufratn, means that] they shall be foremost in [entering] it (a variant reading [for mufratn] has mufritn, meaning that \u0060they transgress the bounds\u0027).",
  "By God, We verily sent to communities before you, messengers. But Satan adorned for them their deeds, [their] evil [deeds], so that they considered them to be good [deeds] and therefore they denied the messengers. So he is their patron, the guardian of their affairs, today, that is, [now] in this world, and for them there will be a painful chastisement, in the Hereafter. It is also said that by al-yawm, \u0060today\u0027, is meant the Day of Resurrection, narrating the events as though they are taking place [now]. In other words, they have no guardian other than him [in other words, Satan], and as he is incapable of helping himself, how could he possibly help them?",
  "And We have not revealed to you, O Muhammad (s), the Book, the Qur\u0027n, except [for the purpose] that you may make clear to them, to mankind, that wherein they differ, in the matter of religion, and as a guidance (wa-hudan is a supplement to wa-li-tubayyina, \u0060and that you may make clear\u0027) and as a mercy for a people who believe, in it.",
  "And God sends down water from the heaven and therewith revives the earth, with plants, after its death, [after] its drying up. Surely in that, which is mentioned, there is a sign, indicating the [truth of the] Resurrection, for a people who listen, listening and then reflecting.",
  "And truly for you there is in the cattle a lesson, an example to learn from. We give you to drink -- [this introduces] the explanation of the \u0060lesson\u0027 -- of that which is in their bellies, the cattle\u0027s [bellies], from (min indicates a new subject and is semantically connected to nusqkum, \u0060We give you to drink\u0027) between the refuse, the intestinal waste, and the blood, pure milk, uncontaminated by either the refuse or the blood, neither in its taste, odour or colour, even though it [the milk] is [situated] between the two, palatable to drinkers, easily passing down their throats, not causing any choking.",
  "And of the fruits of date-palms and vines, [comes forth] a fruit, from which you draw an intoxicant, a wine that intoxicates -- it [the wine] is referred to by the verbal noun [sakaran, \u0060intoxicant\u0027], and this [verse] came before it was prohibited -- and goodly provision, such as dates, raisins, vinegar, and molasses. Surely in that, which is mentioned, there is a sign, indicating His power, exalted be He, for a people who understand, [a people who] reflect.",
  "And your Lord revealed to the bee, a revealing [effected] through inspiration, [saying] (an, \u0060that\u0027, is either explicative or relates to the verbal noun): \u0060Choose among the hills habitations, to which you can resort, and among the trees, [also] habitations, and among the trellises which they raise, that is, the places which humans build for you -- for otherwise it [the bee] would not resort to these [places].",
  "Then eat from every [kind of] fruit, and follow, enter, the ways of your Lord, [follow] His paths in seeking pastures, [ways] made easily accessible\u0027 (dhululan is the plural of dhall, and is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-subul, \u0060the ways\u0027, in other words, [those paths] disposed for you, such that they pose no difficulty for you, even if it should be rough [terrain], and [such that] you would not lose your way when returning therefrom, even if it be far away; it [dhululan] is also said to be [a circumstantial qualifier] referring to the person of [the pronominal suffix of] fa\u0027sluk, \u0060you follow\u0027, meaning [in this case] [follow those paths] in compliance with what is required of you). There comes forth from their bellies a drink, namely, honey, of diverse hues, wherein is a cure for mankind, from [all] ailments; it is also said [that it means that it is a cure only] for some [ailments], as indicated by the indefinite [noun] shif\u0027un, \u0060a cure\u0027; or [that it is a cure] for all [ailments] when supplemented with some other [remedy]; or without these [other remedies] but with the resolve (niyya) [to get better]. The Prophet (s) used to prescribe it for anyone suffering from stomach pains, as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim]. Surely in that there is a sign for a people who reflect, upon God\u0027s handiwork, exalted be He.",
  "And God has created you, when you were nothing, then He takes you [in death], when your terms [of life] are concluded; and there are some among you who are relegated to the most abject stage of life, that is, the most diminished, because of old-age and senility, so that he knows nothing after [having possessed] some knowledge. \u0060Ikrima said, \u0060Whoever recites the Qur\u0027n will not come to such a predicament\u0027. God is Knowing, of how to manage [the affairs of] His creation, Powerful, in [doing] what He will.",
  "And God has favoured some of you above others in [respect of] provision, thus, some of you are poor, some are rich, some owners, others are owned. Now those who have been [more] favoured, namely, the masters, would not hand over their provision to those [slaves] whom their right hands possess, that is, they would not assign that wealth and other things which We have given them as something to be shared [equally] between them and their slaves, so that they, that is, the slaves and [their] masters, become equal, partners, in respect thereof. The meaning is: they do not have partners from among their slaves in respect of their wealth, so how can they make certain of God\u0027s servants partners of His? Is it then the grace of God that they deny?, [that] they reject, when they ascribe partners to Him?",
  "And God made for you mates from your own selves, thus He created Eve from Adam\u0027s rib and [created] all mankind from the seminal fluids of men and women, and made for you, from your mates, children and grandchildren, and He provided you with the good things, of [all] kinds of fruits, seeds and animals. Is it then in falsehood, [in] the idol, that they believe and in the grace of God that they disbelieve?, when they associate others [with God]?",
  "And they worship besides God, that is, other than Him, what has no power to give them any [sort of] provision from the heavens, such as water, and the earth, such as plants (shay\u0027an, \u0060any[thing]\u0027, is a substitute for rizqan, \u0060provision\u0027) nor do they have the capacity, [nor] are they able to do anything -- and these are the idols.",
  "So do not strike any similitude for God, [do not] ascribe to God likenesses and then associate them with Him [in power]. Truly God knows, that there is nothing like Him, and you do not know, this.",
  "God strikes a similitude (mathalan, this is substituted by [the following, \u0060abdan mamlkan]) a slave who is a chattel (mamlkan, an adjective to distinguish him [this type of slave] from a free man, who is the servant of God [alone]) having no power over anything, since he has no mastery, and one on whom (man, is an indefinite [noun], adjectivally qualified, in other words, a free man) We have bestowed a fair provision from Us, such that he spends thereof secretly and openly, that is, disposing of it as he wishes: the first similitude is for the idols, while the second is His, exalted be He. Are they equal?, the powerless slaves and the dispensing free men? No. Praise belongs to God, alone. But most of them, that is, the people of Mecca, do not know, the chastisement they will come to, and so they associate others with God.",
  "And God strikes a similitude (mathalan, this is substituted by [the following, rajulayn]) two men, one of whom is dumb [from birth], having no power over anything, as he cannot understand nor be understood, and who is a liability, burdensome, to his master: -- the [legal] guardian of his affairs -- wherever he directs him, he does not bring, therefrom, any good, he does [not] succeed, and this is the similitude of the disbeliever. Is he, that is, the dumb one mentioned, equal to one who enjoins justice, that is, to one who is able to speak, of benefit to people, since he enjoins it [justice] and encourages [others to] it, and follows a path, a way, that is straight? -- this being the second [man], the believer -- No [he is not equal to him]. It is also said that this [last similitude] is a similitude of God, while the [similitude of the] dumb one is of the idols, so that the preceding [verse] contains the similitude of the disbeliever and the believer.",
  "And to God belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth, in other words, the knowledge of what is hidden in them. And the matter of the Hour is but as the twinkling of an eye, or it is [even] nearer, since it takes place as a result of the words, \u0060Be\u0027 and it is (kun fa-yakn). Truly God has power over all things.",
  "And God brought you forth from the bellies of your mothers while you did not know anything (the statement [l ta\u0060lamna shay\u0027an, \u0060while you did not know anything\u0027] is a circumstantial qualifier), and He gave you hearing and sight and hearts that perhaps you might give thanks, to Him for this [gift] and become believers.",
  "Have they not observed the birds [how they are] made subservient, disposed to [be able to] fly, in the air of heaven?, that is, in the air between the heaven and the earth. Nothing holds them, when they draw in their wings or open them, lest they fall, except God, by His power. Indeed in that there are signs for a people who believe, [the signs] which are that they have been created in a way that enables them to fly, as well as the creation of the air in such a way that it allows for flight, and the holding of them [up in the air so that they do not fall].",
  "And it is God Who has made for you your homes as a place of rest, a place that you can inhabit, and He has made for you out of the skins of the cattle homes, such as tents and pavilions, which you find light, to carry, on the day of your migration, your travel, and on the day of your halting; and of their wool, that is, the sheep\u0027s, and their fur, that is, the camels\u0027, and their hair, that is, the goats\u0027, [He has made for you] furniture, chattels such as rugs and blankets, and wares, for you to use, for a while, until they perish.",
  "And it is God Who has made for you, from what He created, of houses, trees and clouds, shade (zill is the plural of zill) to protect you from the heat of the sun; and He has made for you, in the mountains, places of refuge (aknn is the plural of kinn, which is [a places] where one can seek shelter [istakanna], such as a cave or a tunnel); and He has made for you garments, shirts, that protect you from the heat, that is, and [also] from the cold, and garments that protect you from your [mutual] violence, [your] warring, in other words, [to protect you] from stabbed or struck during these [instances], [garments] such as coats of mail and armour plates. So, in the same way that He has created these things, He perfects His favour -- in this world -- to you, by creating that of which you have need, so that you, O people of Mecca, might submit, [that you might] affirm His Oneness.",
  "But if they turn away, [if] they reject Islam, your duty, O Muhammad (s), is only to convey [the Message] plainly -- this was [revealed] before the command to fight [the disbelievers].",
  "They recognise God\u0027s grace, that is, they affirm that it comes from Him, and then deny it, by associating others [with Him], and most of them are ungrateful.",
  "And, mention, the day We shall raise up from every community a witness, and this will be it [that community\u0027s] prophet, to bear witness for it and against it, and this [day] is the Day of Resurrection; then the disbelievers will not be given permission, to make excuses, nor will they be asked to make amends, that is, [nor will they be asked] to [repent and] return to that which pleases God.",
  "And when those who did wrong, [those who] disbelieved, behold the chastisement, the Fire, it shall not be lightened for them, the chastisement, nor will they be granted any respite, [any] deferment from it when they see it.",
  "And when the idolaters behold their associates, of devils and others, they will say, \u0060Our Lord, these are our associates whom we used to invoke, [whom we used] to worship, besides You\u0027. But they will fling to them the saying, that is, they will say to them: \u0060You are indeed liars!\u0027, when you say that you used to worship us -- as is stated [by them] in another verse: \u0060It was not us that they worshipped\u0027 [Q. 28:63]; [and also in the verse] They will deny their worship of them [Q. 19:82].",
  "And they will offer submission to God on that day, that is, they will have surrendered to His judgement, and that which they used to invent, in the way of [claiming that] their gods intercede for them, will fail, forsake, them.",
  "Those who disbelieve and bar, people, from the way of God, [from] His religion, them, We shall add chastisement to [their] chastisement, that [chastisement] which they have merited for their disbelief -- Ibn Mas\u0060d said, \u0060[Their chastisment will consist of] scorpions whose fangs are [as long] as the tallest palm trees\u0027 -- because of the corruption they used to cause, by their barring people from belief.",
  "And, mention, the day We shall raise up from every community a witness against them from among themselves, and this will be their [that community\u0027s] prophet, and We shall bring you, O Muhammad (s), as a witness against these, namely, your people. And We have revealed to you the Book, the Qur\u0027n, as a clarification of all things, that people [might] need concerning the Law, and as a guidance, from error, and a mercy and good tidings, of Paradise, to those who submit, [those who] affirm the Oneness [of God].",
  "Indeed God enjoins justice -- [that is] affirmation of [His] Oneness, or [actually] being fair, and virtue, performance of the [religious] obligations, or that you should worship God as if you were able to see Him, as [reported] in the hadth; and giving to kinsfolk -- He has singled it [kinship] out for mention by way of [highlighting] its importance -- and He forbids lewdness, fornication, and abomination, with regard to the [stipulations of the] Law, [abomination] such as disbelief and acts of disobedience, and aggression, wrongdoing against people -- He also singles this out for mention by way of [showing] its importance; just as He began with [the mention of] \u0060lewdness\u0027, in this way, He admonishes you, through commands and prohibitions, so that you might remember, [that you might] be admonished (tadhakkarna, \u0060you [might] remember\u0027, the original t\u0027 [of tatadhakkarna] has been assimilated with the dhl). In the Mustadrak [of al- Hkim al-Naysbr] it is reported from Ibn Mas\u0060d that [he said]: \u0060This [verse] is the most comprehensive verse in the Qur\u0027n in terms of [what is] good and [what is] evil\u0027.",
  "And fulfil God\u0027s covenant, [effected] by way of pledges of allegiance and oaths and in other ways, when you made a covenant, and do not break [your] oaths after pledging them and having made God surety over you, that you will fulfill [the covenant], for you have sworn [the oath] by Him (the sentence wa-qad ja\u0060altumu\u0027Llha \u0060alaykum kaflan, \u0060and having made God surety over you\u0027, is a circumstantial qualifier). Truly God knows what you do -- [this is] a threat for them.",
  "And do not be like her who undoes, spoils, her yarn, that which she has spun, after having made it strong, [having] set and spun it, [breaking it up] into fibres (ankthan is a circumstantial qualifier, [ankth is] the plural of nikth, and means that which is undone [yunkathu]) -- this was an imbecile Meccan woman who used to spin all day and then undo it -- by making (tattakhidhna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of [the verb] takn, \u0060[do not] be like\u0027), in other words, [what is meant is] \u0060do not be like her by making\u0027, your oaths a [means of] deceit, (dakhal, is what enters [yadkhulu] into something but does not belong to it), in other words, as [a means of causing] mischief or as trickery, between you, by breaking these [oaths], so that one group may become more numerous than [another] group. They used to enter into an alliance with a given group, but if they encountered another more numerous and more powerful [group], they would renege on their alliance with the former and forge a [new] alliance with these [latter]. God only tries, tests, you thereby, in other words, by that which He enjoins, in the way of fulfilling the covenant, so that He may observe the obedient and the disobedient among you, or when [it is the case that] one group is more numerous [than another], that He may observe whether you fulfil [your obligation to them] or not; and certainly He will make clear to you on the Day of Resurrection that wherein you used to differ, during [the life of] this world, with regard to covenants and otherwise, by punishing he who reneged and rewarding he who was faithful [to his covenant].",
  "For if God had willed, He could have made you one community, people of a single religion, but He leads astray whom He will and guides whom He will, and you will surely be questioned, on the Day of Resurrection, a questioning of rebuke, about what you used to do, so that you might be requited for it.",
  "And do not make your oaths a [means of] deceit between you -- He repeats this [here] for emphasis -- lest a foot should slip, that is, [lest] your feet [should slip] off the path of Islam, after being steady, having been set upon it, and [lest] you should taste evil, that is, chastisement, forasmuch as you barred [people] from the way of God, in other words, for your refraining to fulfil covenants or barring others from [doing] this, since your custom [once established] will be followed [by others], and there be a tremendous chastisement for you, in the Hereafter.",
  "And do not sell God\u0027s covenant for a small price, of this world, so that you break it in return for this [small price]. For truly what is with God, of reward, is better for you, than all that is in this world -- if you should know, this, then do not break it.",
  "That which is with you, of [the things of] this world, will come to an end, will perish, but that which is with God remains, [it is] everlasting. And He shall surely pay (read la-yajziyanna or la-najziyanna, \u0060We shall surely pay\u0027) those who were patient, in fulfilling their covenants, their reward according to the best of what they used to do, \u0060the best\u0027 [here] means \u0060the good\u0027.",
  "Whoever acts righteously, whether male or female, and is a believer, him verily We shall revive with a goodly life. This is said to be life in Paradise; or it is life on earth, [when it is] one of contentedness or one of wholesome (hall) provision. And We shall surely pay them their reward according to the best of what they used to do.",
  "And when you recite the Qur\u0027n, that is, when you intend to recite it, seek refuge in God from Satan the outcast, in other words, say a\u0060dhu bi\u0027Lllhi min al-shaytn al-rajm, \u0060I seek refuge in God from the accursed Satan\u0027.",
  "Indeed he has no power, sway, over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord.",
  "His [Satan\u0027s] power is only over those who choose him as [their] patron, by obeying him, and those who ascribe partners to Him, that is, to God.",
  "And when We exchange a verse in place of a [different] verse, by abrogating it and revealing another, for the welfare of [God\u0027s] servants -- and God knows best what He reveals -- they say, that is, the disbelievers [say] to the Prophet (s): \u0060You are just a fabricator\u0027, a liar, making it up yourself. Nay, most of them do not know, the true nature of the Qur\u0027n and the benefit [to God\u0027s servants] of abrogation.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060The Holy Spirit, Gabriel, has revealed it from your Lord with truth (bi\u0027l-haqq, this is semantically connected to nazzala, \u0060he [Gabriel] has revealed [it]\u0027) to confirm [the faith of] those who believe, by their believing in it [when it is revealed], and as guidance and good tidings for those who have submitted [to God]\u0027.",
  "And verily (wa-laqad is for confirmation) We know that they say, \u0060It is only a human that is teaching him, the Qur\u0027n\u0027 -- this was a Christian blacksmith whom the Prophet (s) used to frequent. God, exalted be He, says: The tongue, the language, of him to whom they refer, to whom they incline, [with the accusation] that he is [the one] teaching him, is foreign\u0027; while this, Qur\u0027n, is [in] a clear Arabic tongue, one of lucidity and clarity: so how can a foreigner be teaching him?",
  "Indeed those who do not believe in God\u0027s signs -- God shall not guide them and there is a painful chastisement for them.",
  "Only those invent falsehood who do not believe in God\u0027s signs, the Qur\u0027an, by saying that these are the words of a human, and it is they who are the liars (the emphasis is [effected] by way of repetition; wa-inna, \u0060and indeed\u0027, and other [combinations of inna] are [used] in refutation of their saying, \u0060You are just a fabricator\u0027 [above, Q. 16:101]).",
  "Whoever disbelieves in God after [having affirmed] his faith -- except for him who is compelled, to pronounce [a statement of] unbelief and so pronounces it, while his heart is at rest in faith (man, \u0060whoever\u0027, is [either] a subject or a conditional, and so the predicate [of this subject], or the response [to this conditional], is [an implied] lahum wa\u0060dun shadd, \u0060there is for them a severe threat [of chastisement]\u0027; this is indicated by [the statement that follows]) -- but he who opens up his breast to unbelief, that is, [he who] opens it up and expands it [with unbelief], meaning that his soul is content with it, upon such shall be wrath from God, and there is a great chastisement for them.",
  "That, threat [of chastisement] for them, is because they have preferred the life of this world, they have chosen it [in preference], to the Hereafter, and because God does not guide the disbelieving folk.",
  "They are the ones on whose hearts God has set a seal, and on their hearing and their sight [as well], and it is they who are heedless, of what [punishment] is being prepared for them.",
  "Without a doubt -- verily -- in the Hereafter they are the ones who will be the losers, because their journey\u0027s end shall be the Fire, in which they shall be perpetually.",
  "Then indeed your Lord -- as for those who emigrated, to Medina, after they were persecuted, [after] they were tortured and [compelled to] pronounce [words of] unbelief (a variant reading [for futin, \u0060they were persecuted\u0027] has fatan, in other words, \u0060[after] they disbelieved\u0027, or \u0060[after] they turned people away from belief\u0027), and then struggled and were patient, in obedience -- indeed your Lord after that, that is, [after] such a trial, is Forgiving, of them, Merciful, to them (the predicate of the first inna, \u0060indeed\u0027, is indicated by the predicate of the second one).",
  "Mention, the day when every soul will come pleading, arguing, for itself, not concerned for any other [soul] -- this is the Day of Resurrection -- and every soul will be repaid, the requital [of], what it has done and they will not be wronged, at all.",
  "And God strikes a similitude (mathalan is substituted by [the following, qaryatan]) a town, Mecca -- meaning its inhabitants -- secure, from any raids, never becoming agitated, and peaceful, without anyone ever needing to emigrate from it, on account of anxiety or fear, its provision coming to it plenteously, abundantly, from every place. But it rejected God\u0027s graces, by denying the Prophet (s), so God made it taste the garb of hunger, and so they suffered seven years of drought, and fear, as a result of the raiding parties of the Prophet (s), [all] because of what they used to do.",
  "And verily there came to them a messenger from among them, Muhammad (s), but they denied him, and so the chastisement, of hunger and fear, seized them while they were evildoers.",
  "So eat, O believers, of the lawful and good food which God has provided you, and be thankful for God\u0027s grace, if it is Him that you worship.",
  "He has forbidden you only carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been hallowed to other than God. Yet whoever is compelled, neither craving nor transgressing, then truly God is Forgiving, Merciful.",
  "And do not say, concerning that which your own tongues qualify, falsehood [such as] \u0060This is lawful, and this is unlawful\u0027, for what God [respectively] has not made lawful, and what He has not made unlawful, in order to invent lies against God, by attributing such [claims] to Him. Truly those who invent lies against God will not prosper.",
  "For them [there will be], a brief enjoyment, in this world, and for them, in the Hereafter, there will be a painful chastisement.",
  "And to those of Jewry, that is, the Jews, We forbade that which We have related to you already, in the verse, And to those of Jewry We forbade every beast with hoof ... to the end [Q. 6:146]; and We did not wrong them, by forbidding [them] that, but they used to wrong themselves, by committing acts of disobedience which necessarily bring about such [consequences].",
  "Then indeed your Lord -- to those who did evil, associating others [with God], out of ignorance, and then repented, returned [to God\u0027s way], after that and made amends, in their actions -- indeed your Lord after that, that is, [after] that ignorance, or that repentance, is Forgiving, of them, Merciful, to them.",
  "Truly Abraham was a community, a leader (imm), a [good] example, comprising [in his character] all the good traits, obedient to God, a hanf, inclining towards the upright religion, and he was not of the idolaters;",
  "grateful [as he was] for His graces, He chose him, elected him, and guided him to a straight path.",
  "And We gave him (herein is a shift [to the first person plural] from the third person) in this world good, which is handsome praise [of him] by members of all [three] religions, and in the Hereafter he will indeed be among the righteous, for whom there will be the highest degrees [of reward].",
  "Then We revealed to you, O Muhammad (s), [saying]: \u0060Follow the creed, the religion, of Abraham, a hanf, and he was not of the idolaters\u0027: this [remark] is repeated in order to refute to the claim of the Jews and Christians that they follow his religion.",
  "The Sabbath was only prescribed, in other words, its consecration was made obligatory [only], for those who differed concerning it, with their prophet -- these were the Jews. They were commanded to devote themselves solely to worship on Friday, but they said, \u0060We do not want it\u0027, and chose Saturday; consequently thereon [the observance of] it was enforced strictly on them; and lo! your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection, concerning that wherein they used to differ, with regard this matter [of the Sabbath], by rewarding the obedient and chastising the one who disobeyed by [his] violating its sanctity.",
  "Call, mankind, O Muhammad (s), to the way of your Lord, [to] His religion, with wisdom, [with] the Qur\u0027n, and fair exhortation, its [the Qur\u0027n\u0027s] fair exhortations, or with gentle words, and dispute with them by way of that which, that is, by way of that [manner of] disputation which, is best, such as calling [them] to God by way of His signs and calling [them] to His definitive arguments. Truly your Lord knows best, that is, He is fully knowledgeable [of], those who stray from His way and He knows best those who are guided, and will requite them -- this was [revealed] before the command to fight [them].",
  "After Hamza [b. \u0060Abd al-Muttalib] had been killed and mutilated, and the Prophet (s) had seen him and said, \u0060Verily I will mutilate 70 of them for you\u0027, the following was revealed: And if you retaliate, retaliate with the like of what you have been made to suffer; and yet if you endure patiently, [refraining] from revenge, verily that, namely, [that] enduring, is better for the patient. Thus the Prophet (s) refrained [from taking revenge] and made atonement for his oath, as reported by al-Bazzr.",
  "So be patient, and your patience is only by [the help of] God, [only] by His assistance. And do not grieve for them, that is, [for] the disbelievers if they do not believe, despite your eagerness that they believe, nor be in distress because of that which they scheme, in other words, do not be concerned with their scheming, for I [God] will make victorious over them.",
  "Truly God is with those who fear, [falling into] unbelief and [committing] acts of disobedience, and those who are virtuous, by way of obedience and patience, [granting them] assistance and victory. Meccan, except for verses 26, 33 [or 32], 57, and from 73 to the end of 80, which are Medinese; it consists of 111 verses and was revealed after [srat] al-Qasas.",
  "Glory be to Him -- an affirmation of [God\u0027s] transcendence -- Who carried His servant, Muhammad (s), by night (laylan is in the accusative as an adverbial qualification; isr\u0027 means \u0060to travel by night\u0027; what is instructive about this mention [of laylan, \u0060by night\u0027] is that, through its being indefinite, there is an indication of the brevity of its duration) from the Sacred Mosque, that is, Mecca, to the Farthest Mosque, the Holy House [of Jerusalem], so called because of its distance from the former; the environs of which We have blessed, with fruits and rivers, that We might show him some of Our signs, the marvels of Our power. Indeed He is the Hearing, the Seeing, that is to say, the Knower of the Prophet\u0027s (s) sayings and deeds. Thus He [God] was gracious to him by way of [carrying him on] the night journey, which comprised his encountering the [other] prophets, his ascension to heaven and the sight of the marvels of the [Divine] Realm and His communion, exalted be He, with him. For he [the Prophet] (s) said: \u0060I was brought al-Burq, a white animal, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule; it was able to place its hoof [back] towards its extremity and so I mounted it. It set off carrying me until I reached the Holy House [of Jerusalem]. [There] I fastened the animal to the ring where the prophets fasten [their animals]. I then went in and prayed two units inside it. As I came out, Gabriel came to me with a jug of wine and a jug of milk, and so I chose the milk. Gabriel said [to me], \u0022You have made the right choice [by choosing] the primordial nature (fitra)\u0022.\u0027 He [the Prophet] continued [the narration], \u0060We then ascended to the heaven of this world, whereat Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, \u0022Who are you?\u0022. He replied, \u0022Gabriel\u0022, \u0022And who is with you?\u0022, \u0022Muhammad (s)\u0022, he said. \u0022Has he been sent for?\u0022. \u0022Yes, he has been sent for\u0022. Then it was opened for us, and lo! Adam stood before me; he greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the second heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, \u0022Who are you?\u0022. He replied, \u0022Gabriel\u0022, \u0022And who is with you?\u0022, \u0022Muhammad (s)\u0022, he said. \u0022Has he been called forth?\u0022. \u0022Yes, he has been called forth\u0022. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there were the two [maternal] cousins, John and Jesus. They greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the third heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, \u0022Who are you?\u0022. He replied, \u0022Gabriel\u0022, \u0022And who is with you?\u0022, \u0022Muhammad (s)\u0022, he said. \u0022Has he been sent for?\u0022 it was asked. \u0022Yes, he has been sent for\u0022. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there was Joseph standing before me, and indeed he had been given one half of all beauty! He greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the fourth heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, \u0022Who are you?\u0022. He replied, \u0022Gabriel\u0022, \u0022And who is with you?\u0022, \u0022Muhammad (s)\u0022, he said. \u0022Has he been called forth?\u0022, it was asked. \u0022Yes, he has been called forth\u0022, he replied. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there before me was Enoch (Idrs). He greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the fifth heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, \u0022Who are you?\u0022. He replied, \u0022Gabriel\u0022. \u0022And who is with you?\u0022 it was asked, \u0022Muhammad (s)\u0022, he replied. \u0022Has he been sent for?\u0022, it was said. \u0022Yes, he has been sent for\u0022, he replied. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there before me was Aaron. He greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the sixth heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, \u0022Who are you?\u0022. He replied, \u0022Gabriel\u0022; \u0022and who is with you?\u0022, \u0022Muhammad (s)\u0022, he said. \u0022Has he been called forth?\u0022, it was asked. \u0022Yes, he has been called forth\u0022. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there before me was Moses. He greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the seventh heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, \u0022Who are you?\u0022. He replied, \u0022Gabriel\u0022, \u0022And who is with you?\u0022; \u0022Muhammad (s)\u0022, he said. \u0022Has he been called forth?\u0022, it was asked. \u0022Yes, he has been called forth\u0022, he replied. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there before me was Abraham, leaning [seated] against the Frequented House (al-bayt al-ma\u0060mr), into which 70,000 angels enter every day never to return thereto. I was then taken to the Lote-Tree of the Boundary (sidrat al- muntah), and lo! its leaves resemble the ears of elephants, its fruits like pitchers [in size]. When some command of God\u0027s enveloped it, it changed, and lo! none of God\u0027s creation could describe it for all its beauty\u0027. He [the Prophet] continued: \u0060God then revealed to me what He revealed and prescribed for me fifty prayers each day and night. I then descended until I reached Moses and he said, \u0022What has your Lord prescribed for your community?\u0022 I said, \u0022Fifty prayers each day and night\u0022. He said, \u0022Go back to your Lord and ask Him for an alleviation, for your community will not have the capacity for it: I have tried the Children of Israel and have experience of them [not being up to the task].\u0022 I then went back to my Lord and said, \u0022My Lord! Lighten that [prescription] for my community\u0022, and so He reduced it for me by five. I went back to Moses who asked me, \u0022What did you do?\u0022. I said to him, \u0060He has reduced it for me by five\u0027, to which he said, \u0022Your community will not have the capacity for this; so go back to your Lord and ask Him for an alleviation for your community\u0022. Thus I kept going back and forth between my Lord and Moses, with Him reducing it by five each time until He said, \u0022O Muhammad (s)! They shall be five prayers each day and night, every prayer will be worth [the reward of] ten [prayers]; that then makes fifty prayers. And whoever intends a good deed but does not perform it, I shall count it for him as one [done]; and if he performs it, I shall count it for him as ten; and whoever intends an evil deed, but does not perform it, it shall not be recorded against him; but if he performs it, it shall be recorded [only] as one evil deed\u0022. I then descended until I reached Moses. I informed him and he said, \u0022Go back to your Lord and ask Him for an alleviation for your community, because your community will not have the capacity for this\u0022; and I said, \u0022I have gone back to my Lord so many times that I am ashamed [to go again]\u0022. This [hadth] is reported by the two Shaykhs [al-Bukhr and Muslim]; but the wording [of this version] is that of [the report in the Sahh of] Muslim. Al-Hkim [al- Naysbr] reports in the Mustadrak by way of Ibn \u0060Abbs that he said, \u0060The Prophet (s) said, \u0022I did see my Lord, Mighty and Majestic\u0022.\u0027",
  "God, exalted be He, says: And We gave Moses the Scripture, the Torah, and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel [saying] that they should not choose beside Me any guardian, to whom they delegate their affairs (a variant reading [for yattakhidh, \u0060they should [not] choose\u0027] is tattakhidh, \u0060you should [not] choose\u0027, thus turning away [from the third person address], in which case [the particle] an, \u0060that\u0027, is extra and the \u0060saying\u0027 is implicit).",

  "And We decreed, We revealed, to the Children of Israel in the Scripture, the Torah: \u0060You shall indeed work corruption in the land, the land of Syria, through acts of disobedience, twice and you shall indeed become great tyrants\u0027, you shall perpetrate grave injustice.",
  "So when the time for the first of the two [prophecies], the first of the two occasions for corruption, came, We roused against you servants of Ours of great might, men who are strong in war and assault, who ransacked, who came and went, seeking you out [through], [your] habitations, in the [very] midst of your homes, in order to slay you and take [others among] you captive, and it was a promise fulfilled. Their first act of corruption was their slaying of [the prophet] Zachariah. So Goliath and his army were roused against them, and they slew them and took their children captive and destroyed the Holy House [of Jerusalem].",
  "Then We gave you back the turn, the [rule of the] state and victory, [to prevail] over them, one hundred years later, by having Goliath slain, and We aided you with children and wealth, and made you greater in number, in clan.",
  "And We said: \u0060If you are virtuous, through [acts of] obedience, you are being virtuous to your own souls, since the reward thereof is for them [your souls]; and if you do evil, by way of [working] corruption, it is for them\u0027, your evildoing. So when the time, the occasion, for the other [prophecy] comes, We will raise them forth, that they might ravage you, make you grieve through [their] slaying and taking captive [of you], a grief that will be manifest on your faces, and that they might enter the Temple, the Holy House [of Jerusalem], and destroy it, just as they entered it, and destroyed it, the first time, and that they might destroy, lay waste, all that they conquered, [all that] they gained ascendancy over, utterly, with an utter wasting. They indeed wrought corruption a second time when they slew [the prophet] John. Thus Nebuchadnezzar was roused against them, and so he slew thousands of them and took their children captive and destroyed the Holy House [of Jerusalem].",
  "And We said in the Scripture: It may be that your Lord will have mercy upon you, after the second time, if you were to repent; but if you revert, to [working] corruption, We [too] will revert, to punishment. And assuredly they did revert by denying the Prophet (s), and so he was given power over them, through the slaying of the [Ban] Qurayza, the expulsion of the [Ban] Nadr and the exacting of the jizya-tax from them; and We have made Hell a dungeon for the disbelievers, a place of detention and a prison [for them].",
  "Truly this Qur\u0027n guides to that, to that way, which is straightest, most upright and correct, and gives tidings to the believers who perform righteous deeds that there is a great reward for them.",
  "And, it [this Qur\u0027n] informs, that those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have prepared for them a painful chastisement, namely, the Fire.",
  "And man prays for ill, against himself and his family when he is frustrated, as [avidly as] he prays for good. And mankind is ever hasty, to pray against himself, without contemplating the consequence thereof.",
  "And We made the night and the day two signs, [both] indicators of Our power. Then We effaced the sign of the night, extinguishing its light with darkness, so that you might repose therein (the annexation [yata\u0027layli, \u0060the sign of the night\u0027, is explicative), and made the sign of the day sight-giving, in other words, one in which it is possible to see because of the light; that you may seek, therein, bounty from your Lord, by earning [your livelihood], and that you may know, by both [day and night], the number of years and the reckoning, of the times [of the day], and everything, that might be needed, We have detailed very distinctly, We have explained clearly.",
  "And We have attached every person\u0027s omen -- his deeds -- for him to carry, upon his neck -- this [site] is singled out for mention because fastening [something] to it is [much] more severe; Mujhid [b. Jabr al- Makk] said, \u0060There is not a child born but it has a leaf around its neck in which it is decreed [that the child will be either] fortunate or damned\u0027 -- and We shall bring forth for him, on the Day of Resurrection, a book, in which his deeds are recorded [and], which he will find wide open (yalqhu manshran: both are adjectival qualifications of kitban, \u0060a book\u0027).",
  "And it will be said to him: \u0060Read your book! This day your soul suffices as your own reckoner\u0027.",
  "Whoever is guided, is guided only to [the good of] his own soul, because the reward of his guidance will be for him; and whoever goes astray, goes astray only to its [his soul\u0027s] detriment, because the sin thereof will be held against it. No burdened, [no] sinful, soul shall bear the burden of another, soul. And We never chastise, anyone, until We have sent a messenger, to make clear to him that which is his obligation.",
  "And when We desire to destroy a town We command its affluent ones, those [inhabitants] of its who enjoy the graces [of God], meaning its leaders, [We command them] to obedience, by the tongue of Our messengers; but they fall into immorality therein, rebelling against Our command, and so the Word is justified concerning it, that it should be chastised, and We destroy it utterly, We annihilate it by annihilating its inhabitants and leaving it in ruins.",
  "How many -- in other words, many -- generations, communities, We have destroyed since Noah! And your Lord suffices as One Informed and Beholder of the sins of His servants, Knower of the hidden and manifest aspects of these [sins] (bi-rabbika, \u0060your Lord\u0027, is semantically connected to bi-dhunb, \u0060of the sins\u0027).",
  "Whoever desires, through his deeds, the hasty world, that is, [the life of] this world, We hasten for him therein whatever We will, for whom We please, [such] a hastening, (li-man nurd, \u0060for whom We please\u0027, is a substitute for lahu, \u0060for him\u0027, with the repetition of the genitive particle [li-]). Then We appoint for him, in the Hereafter, Hell, to which he will be exposed, [to which] he will be admitted, condemned, blameful, and rejected, banished from [God\u0027s] mercy.",
  "And whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it with the necessary effort, [that is] he performs the deeds worthy of it, being a believer (wa-huwa mu\u0027minun is a circumstantial qualifier) -- for such their effort will find favour, with God, that is, [their effort will be] accepted and rewarded.",
  "Each, of the two parties, We supply, We give, [to] these and [to] those (h\u0027l\u0027 wa-h\u0027l\u0027 is a substitute [for kullan, \u0060each\u0027) from (min is semantically connected to numiddu, \u0060We supply\u0027) from your Lord\u0027s bounty, in this world. And your Lord\u0027s bounty, therein, is not confined, [it is not] forbidden to anyone.",
  "See how We have given preference to some of them over others, in provision and renown. And truly the Hereafter is greater, grander, in degrees and greater in preferment, to this world, and so one ought to devote one\u0027s attention to it [the Hereafter], to the exclusion of the other.",
  "Do not set up another god besides God, or you will sit blameworthy, forsaken, with no one to assist you.",
  "And your Lord has decreed, He has commanded, that you worship none save Him, and, that you show, kindness to parents, by being dutiful to them. If they should reach old age with you, one of them (ahaduhum is the subject [of the verb]) or both (a variant reading [for yablughanna] has yablughn, \u0060both [should] reach\u0027, in which case ahaduhum would be substituting for the [dual indicator] alif [of yablughn]) then do not say to them \u0060Fie\u0027 (read uffan or uffin, uffa or uffi, a verbal noun meaning tabban, \u0060perish!\u0027 or qubhan, \u0060evil!\u0027) nor repulse them, but speak to them gracious words, fair and gentle [words].",
  "And lower to them the wing of humility, show them your submissive side, out of mercy, that is, on account of your affection for them, and say, \u0060My Lord, have mercy on them, just as they, had mercy on me when [they], reared me when I was little\u0027.",
  "Your Lord knows best what is in your hearts, [in the way] of what may be concealed of dutifulness or disobedience [to parents]. If you are righteous, obedient to God, then truly, to those who are penitent, those who return to obedience of Him, He is Forgiving, of any slip that might have issued on their part regarding their duty to the parents, so long as they do not conceal [within themselves] any disrespect [towards them].",
  "And give the kinsman his due, of dutifulness and kindness, and the needy and the traveller [as well]; and do not squander, by expending for [any purpose] other than in obedience to God.",
  "Indeed squanderers are brothers of devils, that is, they follow their way, and the Devil was ever ungrateful to his Lord, extremely rejective of His graces: likewise his brother the squanderer.",
  "But if you [have to] overlook them, that is, the kinsmen and the others mentioned, and do not give to them, seeking mercy from your Lord, [a mercy] which you expect [in the future], that is, [you do not give to them] because of a request for provision which you are waiting to come to you [from your Lord], before you give to them, then speak to them gentle words, pleasant and reasonable [words], promising them that you will give to them when the provision [from God] arrives.",
  "And do not keep your hand chained to your neck, in other words, do not withhold it completely from expending, nor open it, in order to expend, completely, or you will sit blameworthy -- this refers to the first case -- and denuded, cut off, having nothing -- this refers to the latter case.",
  "Truly your Lord expands provision, He makes it abundant, for whomever He will and He straitens, He restricts it for whomever He will. Indeed He is ever Aware and Seer of His servants, Knower of what they hide and what they manifest, giving them provision in accordance with their welfare.",
  "And do not slay your children, by burying them alive, fearing penury, poverty. We shall provide for them and for you. Slaying them is truly a great sin.",
  "And do not come [anywhere] near fornication -- this [form of expressing it] is more effective than [saying] \u0060Do not commit it\u0027. It is indeed an indecency, an abomination, and, it is, an evil way.",
  "And do not slay the soul [whose life] God has made inviolable, except with due cause. Whoever is slain wrongfully, We have certainly given his heir, the one inheriting from him, a warrant, a sanction [to retaliate] against the slayer; but let him not commit excess, [let him not] overstep the bounds, in slaying, by slaying other than the killer [of the one slain], or by other than that [instrument] with which he [the slain] was killed; for he is supported [by the Law].",
  "And do not come [anywhere] near an orphan\u0027s property, except in the fairest manner until he comes of age. And fulfil the covenant, should you make a covenant with God or with people [in general]. Indeed the covenant will be enquired into.",
  "And give full measure, complete it, when you measure, and weigh with a right balance, [with] an even balance: that is better and fairer in return.",
  "And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed the hearing and the sight and the heart -- of each of these it will be asked, of that person what he did with them.",
  "And do not walk in the earth exultantly, that is, exultant with pride and conceit. Indeed you will not rend the earth, [you will not] pierce it and reach its depths with your pride, nor attain the mountains in height: the meaning is that you shall never attain such ends, so how can you be so arrogant?",
  "All of that, [which has been] mentioned -- the evil of it is hateful in the sight of your Lord.",
  "This is [part] of the wisdom, the admonition, which your Lord has revealed to you, O Muhammad (s). And do not set up with God any other god, or you will be cast into Hell, blameworthy, abandoned, banished from God\u0027s mercy.",
  "Has your Lord then preferred you, has He distinguished you [exclusively], O Meccans, with sons and chosen for Himself females from among the angels?, as daughters for Himself, in the way that you [are wont to] claim. Truly, by [saying] this, you are speaking a monstrous word!",
  "And verily We have dispensed, We have elucidated, in this Qur\u0027n, similitudes, promises [of reward] and threats [of retribution], so that they may remember, [that they may] be admonished, but it, that [elucidation], only increases them in aversion, to the Truth.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060If there were with Him, that is, with God, [other] gods, as they say, they would, in that case, have sought against the Lord of the Throne, that is, [against] God, some path, some way, in order to fight Him [off].",
  "Glory be to Him -- an affirmation of His transcendence -- and exalted be He above what they say, in the way of [His having] associates, greatly!",
  "The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein proclaim His praise, [they] affirm His transcendence. And there is not a thing, among things created, but proclaims, enwrapped [in], His praise, in other words, [everything] says subhna\u0027Llh wa-bi-hamdihi, \u0060Glory and praise be to God\u0027; but you do not understand their glorification, because it is not [proclaimed] in your language. Lo! He is Forbearing, Forgiving, for He does not hasten [to bring about] your punishment.",
  "And when you recite the Qur\u0027n, We place between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter a hidden barrier, that is, one that hides you from them, so that they cannot see you -- this was revealed regarding those who wanted to assassinate him (s) [the Prophet].",
  "And We place upon their hearts veils, covers, lest they should understand it, lest they should understand the Qur\u0027n, in other words, and so [in this way] they do not understand it, and in their ears a deafness, a heaviness, thus they cannot hear it. And when you mention your Lord alone in the Qur\u0027n, they turn their backs in aversion, to it.",
  "We know best what they listen to, the reason for [which they listen to] it, in order to mock [it], when they listen to you, [to] your recital, and when they are in secret counsel, holding secret talks among themselves, in other words, when they talk, when (idh substitutes for the preceding idh, \u0060when\u0027) the evildoers say, in their secret conversation: \u0060You are only following a man bewitched, one duped, his mind overcome\u0027.",
  "God, exalted be He, says: Look how they strike similitudes for you, such as [your being] bewitched, a soothsayer or a poet, and they go astray, thereby from [the path of] guidance, and cannot find a way, a path to it!",
  "And they say, in denial of the Resurrection: \u0060What, when we are bones and fragments, shall we really be raised up in a new creation?\u0027",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Be stones or iron,",
  "or some creation yet greater in your breasts, [something yet] far less able to accept life, aside from bones and fragments, a spirit will undoubtedly be made to exist in you [to bring you back to life]. They will then say, \u0060Who shall bring us back?\u0027, to life. Say: \u0060He Who originated you, created you, the first time, when you had not been anything [in existence], because the One Who is able to initiate [creation] is also able to repeat [it], indeed, this [repetition] is easier [than the initiation]. Then they will shake their heads at you, stupefied, and they will say, mockingly: \u0060When will it be?\u0027, that is, the Resurrection. Say: \u0060Maybe it is near!\u0027",
  "The day He calls you, [the day] He calls out to you from your graves by the tongue of [the archangel] Isrfl, you will respond, you will answer His call from your graves, with His praise, by His command -- it is also said to mean [that you will respond] \u0060and praise be to Him\u0027 -- and you will think that you have remained, in this world, only a little, because of the terror of what you will see [on that day].",
  "And tell My servants, the believers, to speak, to disbelievers, that, word, which is finer. For Satan indeed incites ill feeling, he makes trouble, between them, and Satan is indeed man\u0027s manifest enemy, his enmity is evident. The \u0060finer word\u0027 is [to say] this:",
  "Your Lord knows you best. If He will, He will have mercy on you, by way of [granting you] repentance and faith, or, if He will, for you to be chastised, He will chastise you, by having you die in disbelief. And We did not send you to be a guardian over them, and so compel them to [embrace] faith -- this was [revealed] before the command to fight [them].",
  "And your Lord knows best all who are in the heavens and the earth, thus endowing them [each one] with what He will, according to the measure of their states. And verily We have preferred some of the prophets above others, endowing each of them with a particular merit: Moses, with being spoken to; Abraham, with Friendship; and Muhammad (s), with the Night Journey; and We gave David the Psalms.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Call on those whom you assumed, to be gods, besides Him, such as the angels, Jesus and Ezra (\u0060Uzayr); yet they have no power to rid you of misfortune nor to transfer, it to [persons] other than you.",
  "Those whom they call, gods, [they themselves] seek a means to their Lord, [they seek] nearness, by way of obedience, which of them (ayyuhum substitutes for the [third person indicator] ww of [the verb] yabtaghna, \u0060they seek\u0027) in other words, [even] he seeks it [this nearness] the one who, is nearer, to Him, so how [much more] is it [sought] in the case of others?; and they hope for His mercy and fear His chastisement, just like others, so how can you call them gods? Truly your Lord\u0027s chastisement is a thing to beware of.",
  "There is not a town -- its inhabitants are the ones meant -- but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection, through death, or chastise it with terrible chastisement, by killing [its inhabitants] or otherwise. That has been inscribed in the Book, the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahfz).",
  "Nothing prevented Us from sending the signs, requested by the people of Mecca, except that the ancients denied them, when We sent such [signs] and so We destroyed them: if We were to send them to these [people of Mecca], they would deny them and would thus deserve destruction. However, We have judged that they be given respite so that the mission of Muhammad (s) be completed. And We gave Thamd the she-camel as, a sign [that was], apparent, [one that was] clear and evident, but they wronged, they disbelieved, it, and were therefore destroyed. And We do not send signs, miracles, except for deterrence, to servants, so that they might believe.",
  "And, remember, when We said to you, \u0060Truly your Lord encompasses mankind\u0027, in knowledge and power [over them], such that they are within His grasp: so deliver the Message to them and do not fear anyone, because God will protect you from them. And We did not appoint the vision that We showed you, before your very eyes, during the Night Journey, except as a test for people, [for] the people of Mecca -- since they denied it and some of them [even] apostatised when he [the Prophet] informed them of it -- and [likewise] the tree cursed in the Qur\u0027n, namely, the [tree called] Zaqqm [Q.37:62ff] that issues from the very root of the Blazing Fire [of Hell]; We made it a test for them, because they said, \u0060Fire consumes trees, so how can it cause it [the Zaqqm tree] to issue forth?\u0027. And We [seek to] deter them, with it, but it, Our deterrence, only increases them in gross insolence.",
  "And, mention, when We said to the angels, \u0060Prostrate yourselves before Adam\u0027, a prostration of salutation, by inclining oneself, and so they [all] prostrated themselves, except Ibls: he said, \u0060Shall I prostrate myself before one whom You have created from clay?\u0027 (tnan, is in the accusative because the operator of the oblique [min, \u0060of\u0027] has been omitted, in other words [it would normally be] min tnin).",
  "Said he, \u0060Do You see -- in other words, inform me: this one whom You have honoured, [whom] You have preferred, above me?, by commanding that prostration should be made before him, when \u0060I am better than him. You created me from fire, while him You created from clay\u0027 [Q. 7:12]. If (la-in: the lm is for oaths) You defer me to the Day of Resurrection I shall verily eradicate his seed, by leading them astray, [all] save a few\u0027, of them, of those whom You have given [divine] protection.",
  "Said He, exalted be He, to him [Ibls]: \u0060Begone, deferred to the time of the First Blast [of the Trumpet]. Whoever of them follows you -- indeed Hell shall be your requital, [both] yours and theirs, a requital [that is indeed] ample, sufficient and complete.",
  "And tempt, dupe, whomever of them you can with your voice, by your calling them with songs and pipes and with every invitation to [acts of] disobedience; and rally, incite, against them your cavalry and your infantry, namely, those who ride and walk in acts of disobedience, and share with them in wealth, that is illicit, such as usury and extortion, and children, from [acts of] adultery, and make promises to them\u0027, to the effect that there will not be any resurrection or requital. And Satan promises them, thereby, nothing but delusion, falsehood.",
  "\u0060Truly as for My servants, the believers, you shall have no warrant\u0027, [no] sway or ability. And Your Lord suffices as a guardian, as a protector for them against you.",
  "Your Lord is He Who drives for you the ships upon the sea that you may seek of His bounty, exalted be He, through [engaging in] commerce. Truly He is ever Merciful towards you, by disposing these [ships] for you.",
  "And when distress, difficulty, befalls you at sea, [such as] fear of drowning, those whom you [are wont to] invoke are no longer present, [those whom] you [are wont to] worship of gods [are no longer present], and so you do not call on them -- except Him, exalted be He, for on Him alone you do call, because you are suffering a distress which only He can remove. But when He delivers you, from drowning and brings you, to land, you are rejective, of [God\u0027s] Oneness, for man is ever ungrateful, [ever] denying [God\u0027s] graces.",
  "Do you feel secure that He will not cause a side of the earth, in other words, the land, to swallow you up, as [He did] with Korah (Qrn), or unleash upon you a squall of pebbles? that is, hurl a shower of stones upon you, as [He did] with the people of Lot. Then you will not find for yourselves any guardian, any protector from Him.",
  "Or do you feel secure that He will not return you to it, that is, [to] the sea, a second time and unleash upon you a shattering gale, that is, a violent wind that shatters everything in its path, to destroy your ship, and drown you for your ungratefulness? And then you will not find for yourselves any redresser of this against Us, [any] helper or advocate to demand restitution from Us for what We [will] have done to you.",
  "And verily We have honoured, We have preferred, the Children of Adam, [above other creation], by [giving them] knowledge, speech and [their being] a creation of even proportions amongst other things, including their [means of] purification after death, and carried them over land, on animal-back, and sea, in ships, and provided them with good things and We have preferred them above many of those whom We created, such as livestock and wild animals, with a marked preferment (the min [of mimman, \u0060of those whom\u0027] has the sense of m, \u0060of what\u0027, or something close to it, and includes the angels, the purpose being to give preference to the [angelic] genus; there is no requirement to give [explicit] preference to the individuals [of this category of being], since they [angels] are superior to mankind, excepting the prophets).",
  "Mention, the day when We shall summon all men with their leader, their prophet, and it will be said, \u0060O community of so-and-so\u0027; or [it bi-immihim means] \u0060with the record of their deeds\u0027, in which case it will be said, \u0060O one of good [deeds], O one of evil [deeds]!\u0027: this is [on] the Day of Resurrection. And whoever, from among them, is given his book in his right hand, these being the fortunate, those possessors of understanding in this world -- those will read their book, and they will not be wronged, they will [not] be diminished of their deeds, [so much as] a single date-thread.",
  "And whoever has been in this, that is, [in] this world, blind, to the truth, will be blind in the Hereafter, to the path of salvation and the reciting of the Qur\u0027n, and [even] further astray from the [right] way, more removed from the road [that leads] to it.",
  "The following was revealed regarding the [tribe of] Thaqf, for they had asked him [the Prophet] (s) to declare their valley inviolable and implored him [to grant them this request]: And indeed (wa-in, [the particle in is] softened) they were about to, they nearly did, beguile you away from that which We revealed to you, so that you might invent against Us [something] other than that; and then, had you done that, they would have taken you as a friend.",
  "And if We had not made you [stand] firm, upon the Truth, by way of [divine] protection (\u0060isma), certainly you might have, you nearly, inclined to them a little, because of the extent of their deception and their persistence. This [statement] is explicit about the fact that the Prophet (s) neither inclined nor came close to doing so.",
  "Then, had you inclined, We would have surely made you taste a double, chastisement, in life and a double, chastisement, upon death, in other words, twice the chastisement that any other person would receive in this world and the Hereafter. Then you would not have found for yourself any helper against Us, [anyone] to shield [you] from it.",
  "When the Jews said to him, \u0060If you are a prophet, then make your way to Syria, for it is the land of prophets\u0027, the following was revealed: And indeed (wa-in, [the particle in is] softened) they were about to provoke you out of the land, the land of Medina, to expel you from it, but then, had they expelled you, they would not have remained after you, in it, except a little [while], after which they would have been destroyed.",
  "[That is] the way in the case of those whom We have sent from among Our messengers before you, that is to say, [that is] Our way [of dealing] with them [their enemies], destroying those who expel them [Our messengers]. And as regards Our [established] way you will not find any change, any alternative [manner].",
  "Establish prayer from the sun\u0027s decline, that is, from after midday, until the dark of night, [until] its darkness has fallen, in other words, [perform prayers] at noon, in the afternoon, at sunset and at night, and the recital [of the Qur\u0027n] at dawn, the morning prayer. Verily the dawn recital is ever witnessed, it is witnessed by the angels of the night and the angels of the day.",
  "And for a part of the night, keep vigil, perform prayer, therewith, with the Qur\u0027n, as a supererogatory [devotion] for you, as an extra obligation for you to the exclusion of your community, or [it means] as extra merit [for you] on top of the [other] obligatory prayers. It may be that your Lord will raise you to, establish you, in the Hereafter, in, a praiseworthy station, one for which the first and last [of mankind] will praise you -- and this is the station of intercession [which will take place] during [the passing of] the Final Judgement.",
  "And say: \u0060My Lord, make me enter, Medina, with a veritable entrance, an entrance that is satisfying, one in which I do not see what I dislike, and bring me out, of Mecca, with a veritable departure, a departure such that my heart will not [care to] turn back to look at it [yearningly]. And grant me from Yourself a favourable authority\u0027, [grant me] strength with which You render me victorious over Your enemies.",
  "And say, upon your entry into Mecca: \u0060The Truth, Islam, has come and falsehood has vanished away, disbelief has come to nothing. Truly falsehood is ever bound to vanish\u0027, [ever bound] to fade away and disappear. Indeed the Prophet (s) entered it [Mecca] and there were 360 idols [which had been placed] around the [Sacred] House [sc. the Ka\u0060ba]. He [the Prophet] then set about thrusting at them with a stick he was carrying, saying those [words] until they had [all] been toppled, as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim].",
  "And We reveal of (min [here] is explicative) the Qur\u0027n that which is a cure, from error, and a mercy for believers, thereby; though it only increases the evildoers, the disbelievers, in loss, because of their disbelief in it.",
  "And when We are gracious to man, the disbelieving [man], he is disregardful, of giving thanks, and turns aside, turning his face away in arrogance; but when an ill, such as poverty or hardship, befalls him, he is in despair, despondent of God\u0027s mercy.",
  "Say: \u0060Everyone, [including] us and you, acts according to his [own] character, his [own] manner [of conduct], and your Lord knows best who is better guided as to the way\u0027, [as to] the path [he follows], and He will reward him [accordingly].",
  "And they will question you, that is, the Jews, concerning the Spirit, from which the body receives life. Say, to them: \u0060The Spirit is of the command of my Lord, that is, [it belongs to] His knowledge, about which you know not. And of knowledge you have not been given except a little\u0027, relative to His knowledge, exalted be He.",
  "And if (la-in, the lm is for oaths) We willed We could take away what We have revealed to you, in other words, [take away] the Qur\u0027n, by erasing it from the hearts [of men] and from the written copies. Then you would not find in respect thereof any guardian for yourself against Us;",
  "[it is] only -- but We have let it remain -- as a mercy from your Lord. Truly His favour to you is ever great, tremendous, for He has revealed to you and granted you the praiseworthy station as well as other [kinds of] merit.",
  "Say: \u0060Verily, should mankind and jinn come together to produce the like of this Qur\u0027n, [the like thereof] in terms of clarity and rhetorical excellence, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they backed one another\u0027, [even if one was] an assistant [of the other]. This [verse] was revealed as a refutation of their statement: \u0060If we wish we can speak the like of this\u0027 [Q. 8:31].",
  "And verily We have dispensed, explained, for people in this Qur\u0027n every [kind of] similitude (min kulli mathalin, [this] is an adjectival qualification of an omitted clause, in other words, [\u0060We have dispensed] a similitude from every kind of similitude\u0027), that they might be admonished; but most people, that is, the people of Mecca, insist on disbelieving, on denying the truth.",
  "And they say (wa-ql is a supplement to ab [ill], \u0060insist on\u0027), \u0060We will not believe you until you make gush forth for us from the ground a spring, from which water issues forth;",
  "or until you [come to] have a garden, an orchard, of date-palms and vines, and cause streams to gush forth therein, in the midst of these, abundantly;",
  "or until you cause the heaven to fall upon us, as you assert, in pieces, or bring God and the angels [right] in front [of us], face to face [with us], before [our] very eyes, so that we might see them;",
  "or until you [come to] have a house adorned with gold, or ascend into the heaven, upon a ladder, and [even then] we will not believe your ascension, if you were to ascend into it, until you bring down for us, therefrom, a book, in which is [confirmed] your truthfulness, that we may read\u0027. Say, to them: \u0060Glory be to my Lord -- this is a statement of amazement -- Am I anything but a human, a messenger [from God]?\u0027, in other words, [I am] like all [other] messengers, for they never brought [any] signs except by God\u0027s leave.",
  "And nothing prevented mankind from believing when guidance came to them, but that they said, that is, [except] their saying in denial: \u0060Has God sent a human as a messenger [from Him]?\u0027, instead of sending an angel.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Had there been in the earth, instead of humans, angels, walking [and living] secure, We would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as Messenger\u0027, for when a messenger is sent to a people he is [always] of their kind, so that they are able to speak to him and understand from him [his message].",
  "Say: \u0060God suffices as a witness between me and you, of my sincerity. Truly He is Aware, Seer of His servants\u0027, Knower of what they hide and what they manifest.",
  "And he whom God guides is rightly guided, and he whom He sends astray -- you will not find for them [any] guardians, to guide them, besides Him. And We shall assemble them on the Day of Resurrection, walking, on their faces, blind, dumb, and deaf; their abode shall be Hell -- whenever it abates, [whenever] its flames subside, We shall intensify for them the blaze, the flame and [its] burning.",
  "That is their requital because they disbelieved Our signs and said, in denial of the Resurrection: \u0060What, when we are bones and fragments, shall we really be raised in a new creation?\u0027",
  "Have they not seen, realised, that God, [He] Who created the heavens and the earth, with all their immensity, has the power to create the like of them?, that is, [the like of] these human beings, [especially] given their smallness? He has appointed for them a term, until [the time for their] death and resurrection, whereof is no doubt; yet the wrongdoers insist on disbelief, on denial of such [a term].",
  "Say, to them: \u0060If you possessed the treasuries of my Lord\u0027s mercy, [those treasuries] of provision and rain, you would surely withhold [them], [you would] stint, for fear of spending, fearing that they would be depleted if [one] spent [from them] and [that] you would then become impoverished; and man is ever niggardly\u0027.",
  "And verily We gave Moses nine manifest signs, clear [signs], namely, [those of] the hand, the staff, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, the blood and the obliteration [of their possessions, cf. Q. 10:88], the years [of dearth] and scarcity of fruits [cf. Q. 7:130]. Ask, O Muhammad (s), the Children of Israel, about this (a [rhetorical] question meant as an affirmation for the idolaters of your sincerity; or [it means that] We said to him [Muhammad, s], \u0060Ask\u0027; a variant reading has the past tense [fa-s\u0027ala, \u0060and he asked\u0027]), when he came to them, Pharaoh said to him, \u0060O Moses, I truly think that you are bewitched\u0027, duped, your mind deceived.",
  "He [Moses] said, \u0060Indeed you know that none revealed these, signs, except the Lord of the heavens and the earth, as proofs, lessons; however, you are being stubborn (a variant reading [for \u0060alimta, \u0060you know\u0027] has \u0060alimtu [\u0060I know\u0027]); and I truly think that you, O Pharaoh, are doomed\u0027, [that you] will be destroyed -- or [it, mathbran, means that Pharaoh has been] turned away from [all deeds that are] good.",
  "And he, Pharaoh, desired to scare them, to expel Moses and his people, from the land, the land of Egypt; so We drowned him and those with him, all together.",
  "And after him We said to the Children of Israel, \u0060Dwell in the land; but when the promise of the Hereafter, namely, the Hour, comes to pass, We shall bring you [gathered] in mixed company\u0027, all together, you and them.",
  "With the truth have We revealed it, that is, the Qur\u0027n, and with the truth, it comprises, has it been revealed, in the way it has, unaffected by any alterations; and We have not sent you, O Muhammad (s), except as a bearer of good tidings, of Paradise, for those who believe, and as a warner, of the Fire, for those who disbelieve.",
  "And [it is] a Qur\u0027n (qur\u0027nan is in the accusative because of the verb governing it [which is the following]) that We have divided, that We have revealed in portions over 20 or 23 years, that you may recite it to mankind at intervals, gradually and with deliberateness so that they [are able to] comprehend it, and We have revealed it by [successive] revelation, one part after another, according to what is best [for mankind].",
  "Say, to the disbelievers of Mecca, \u0060Believe in it or do not believe, as a threat to them; indeed those who were given knowledge before it, before its revelation, namely, the believers from among the People of the Scripture, when it is recited to them, fall down in prostration on their faces,",
  "and say, \u0022Glory be to our Lord, exalting Him above [the claim] that [His] promise [of sending a prophet] had not been fulfilled. Indeed (in, softened) Our Lord\u0027s promise, of its [the Qur\u0027n\u0027s] revelation and the sending of the Prophet (s), is bound to be fulfilled\u0022.",
  "And they fall down on their faces, weeping (yabkna is a supplement [to yakhirrna, \u0060they fall down\u0027] also containing an adjectival qualification [of those falling down]); and it, the Qur\u0027n, increases them in humility\u0027, in humbleness before God.",
  "The Prophet (s) would often say, \u0060O God, O Compassionate One\u0027. So they said, \u0060He [Muhammad, s] forbids us to worship more than one god, and yet he calls upon another [god] together with Him [God]\u0027. The following was then revealed: Say, to them: \u0060Invoke God or invoke the Compassionate One, that is to say, invoke Him by either of these [Names] or call upon Him by saying, \u0060O God! O Compassionate One!\u0027, whichever (ayyan is conditional; m is extra), in other words, whichever of these two [Names], you invoke, is beautiful -- this [predicate, \u0060beautiful\u0027] is indicated by the following [statement]), to Him, to the One called by these two [Names], belong the Most Beautiful Names\u0027, these two [Names] being from among them; and they [the other Names] are [the following] as [mentioned] in hadth: God, there is no god except Him, the Compassionate, the Merciful, the King, the Holy, the Peace, the Securer, the Controller, the Mighty, the Compeller, the Sublime, the Creator, the Maker [out of nothing], the Fashioner, the [ever] Forgiving, the Almighty, the Bestower, the Provider, the Deliverer, the Knower, the Seizer, the Extender, the Lowerer, the Raiser, the Glorifier, the Abaser, the Hearer, the Seer, the Arbiter, the Just, the Subtle, the Aware, the Forbearing, the Tremendous, the Forgiver, the Thankful, the High, the Great, the Preserver, the Conserver, the Reckoner, the Majestic, the Generous, the Watcher, the Responsive, the Embracing, the Wise, the Loving, the Glorious, the Resurrector, the Witnessing, the Truth, the Guardian, the Strong, the Firm, the Patron, the Praiseworthy, the Numberer, the Initiator, the Restorer, the Life-giver, the Death-maker, the Living, the Eternal Sustainer, the Originator, the Magnificent, the One, the Single, the Everlasting Refuge, the Powerful, the Omnipotent, the Advancer, the Deferrer, the First, the Last, the Outward, the Inward, the Ruler, Exalted, the Benign, the Relenting, the Avenger, the Pardoning, the Gentle, Master of the Kingdom, One of Majesty and Munificence, the Equitable, the Gatherer, the Independent, the Availing, the Restrainer, the Harming, the Benefactor, the Light, the Guiding, the Innovator, the Enduring, the Inheritor, the Reasonable, the Patient, as reported by al-Tirmidh. God, exalted be He, says: And do not be loud in your prayer, when you recite [the Qur\u0027n] therein, lest the idolaters hear you and curse you, as well as the Qur\u0027n and the One Who has revealed it; nor be silent, do [not] murmur, therein, so that your companions might [be able to hear it and] benefit [therefrom]; but seek between that, loudness and silence, a, middle, way.",
  "And say: \u0060Praise be to God, Who has neither taken a son, nor has He any partner in sovereignty, in divineness, nor has He [taken] any ally, to assist Him, out of, because of [any], weakness\u0027, that is to say, He would never become weak and thus need an assistant. And magnify Him with magnifications [worthy of Him], extol Him with a perfect extolling above that He should have taken a son or a partner, and [above] any weakness and [above] all that does not befit Him. The arrangement whereby \u0060praise\u0027 is [invoked] together with this [statement] is meant to indicate that He is the One worthy of all praise, because of the perfection of His Essence and the fact that He alones possesses those attributes of His. Imam Ahmad [b. Hanbal] relates in his Musnad [by way of a report] from Mu\u0060dh al-Juhan [who heard it] from the Messenger of God (s), who used to say, \u0060The \u0022glory\u0022 verse [in the Qur\u0027n] is: Praise be to God, Who has neither taken a son, nor has He any partner in sovereignty ... to the end [of the above-mentioned sra, 17:111]\u0027, and God, exalted be He, knows best. The author of this [commentary] says, \u0060This [last commentary] constitutes the end of my complement to the commentary on the Noble Qur\u0027n composed by the inquisitive scholar, the shaykh, Imam Jall al-Dn al- Mahall al-Shfi\u0060, may God be pleased with him. I have expended every effort in it and reflected throughout it exhaustively, [especially] in those precious things that I have deemed, God willing, to be profitable. I composed it [this commentary] in the same length of time appointed for the one spoken to by God [sc. Moses] and I have made it a means to attaining the Gardens of Bliss. It [this commentary] actually draws on the work which it complements, relying and depending on it for [an understanding of] those allegorical verses. May God have mercy on one who examines it with impartiality, chances upon an error and informs me of it. As I have said: \u0022I praise God, my Lord, for He guided me in what I have expressed despite my incapacity and weakness; for who [other than God] is there to avert me from error and who is there to accept from me even a single letter\u0022. In fact, it never occurred to me to embark upon such [a task], knowing that I was incapable of delving into such issues. Perhaps God will make it of ample profit [to others] and through it open sealed hearts, blinded eyes and deaf ears. I have the impression that I am before those [sort of readers] who would prefer works of prolixity, refraining from [referring to] this complementary work, rejecting it outright, tending to obvious obstinacy [regarding it], without addressing its intricacies with any understanding: And whoever is blind in this world shall be blind in the Hereafter [Q. 17:72]. May God thereby provide us with a [way of] guidance to the path of truth, with success, an awareness of the subtle intricacies of His words and with an ascertainment. May He thereby also make us with those to whom God has been gracious from among the prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the righteous -- and excellent companions are they! [Q. 4:69]. He [Jall al-Dn al-Suyt] completed the composition of this [work] on Sunday, 10th of Shawwl, in the year 870 (AH) [1465 AD], having commenced it on the first Wednesday of Ramadn of the same year. He completed the fair copy [of this work] on Wednesday, 6th of Safar in the year 871 (AH) [1466 AD], and God knows best. Shaykh Shams al-Dn Muhammad b. Ab Bakr al-Khatb al-Tkh said: my friend the erudite shaykh Kaml al-Dn al-Mahall, brother of the above-mentioned shaykh of ours, shaykh Jall al-Dn al- Mahall, may God have mercy on both of them, that he saw his brother, the above-mentioned shaykh Jall al-Dn, in his dream: before him stood our friend the inquiring erudite scholar shaykh Jall al-Dn al-Suyt, compiler of this complement. He [Mahall] had this complement in his hand and, perusing it, he was saying to its above-mentioned compiler [Suyt], \u0060Which of the two is better, my composition or yours?\u0027. He [Suyt] said, \u0060Mine\u0027. He [Mahall] then said, \u0060But look at this ...\u0027, and he showed him parts of it, politely pointing out to him his objections thereto. Each time he [Mahall] brought something up, the compiler of this complement [Suyt] would respond to him, while shaykh [Mahall] would smile and laugh. Our shaykh, the imam, the erudite scholar Jall al-Dn \u0060Abd al-Rahmn b. Ab Bakr al-Suyt, compiler of this complement said: What I believe, and what I am absolutely certain of, is that the part composed by shaykh Jall al-Dn al-Mahall, may God have mercy on him, in his section [of the commentary] is actually better than mine by far. How [could it be otherwise], when most of what I have written here draws on his work and relies on it? I have no doubt about this. As regards what was seen in the above-mentioned dream, then perhaps it is the case that the shaykh meant to point out those few places in which I disagreed with what he had written on account of some little comment [that I had made therein]. But these [instances] are very few and I do not think that they add up to more than ten such instances. Among these is where shaykh [al-Mahall] comments in srat Sd: \u0060The Spirit is a delicate organism (jism latf) that gives life to a human being by permeating it\u0027. I followed this [opinion] at first, but then I remembered the restriction [made by God] while [working on the commentary] at srat al-Hijr; and so I erased it because of where God says, And they will question you concerning the Spirit. Say, \u0060The Spirit is of the command of my Lord. And of knowledge you have not been given except a little [...]\u0027 [to the end of] the verse [Q. 15:85]. For, it is explicit, or almost explicit, in stating that the [true nature of the] Spirit is of God\u0027s knowledge [only], exalted be He -- we do not know it. Thus, it is better that we should refrain from trying to define it. For this reason also, shaykh Tj al-Dn b. al-Subk says in [his work] Jam\u0060 al-jawmi\u0060 (The compendium of compendiums\u0027): \u0060As for the spirit, Muhammad (s) never spoke about it and we should [also] therefore refrain [from speaking about it].\u0027 Another [instance] is where the shaykh says in [his commentary to] srat al-Hajj [Q. 22:17], \u0060The Sabaeans (al-sbi\u0027n) are a Jewish sect\u0027. I mention this in [my commentary to] srat al-Baqara [Q. 2:62], where I added the following [gloss] \u0060or [they are] a Christian [sect]\u0027, in order to point out a variant opinion, generally acknowledged, particularly by our colleagues, the [Shfi\u0060] jurists, and [also acknowledged] by the Minhj (\u0060The Method [...]\u0027), where it is stated that the Samaritans opposed the Jews and the Sabaeans [opposed] the Christians [respectively] over the fundamentals of their religion. In his [Mahall\u0027s] Sharh (\u0060Commentary\u0027), al-Shfi\u0060, may God be pleased with him, is reported to have said that the Sabaeans were a Christian sect. At this moment, I cannot recall a third instance [of Mahall\u0027s objections]. Perhaps these are the sort of examples which the Shaykh, may God have mercy on him, was pointing out [in the dream]. And God knows best what is correct, and to Him is the return and the [final] resort. Meccan, except for verses 28, and from [verses] 82 to the end of 101, which are Medinese; it consists of 110 or 115 verses, revealed after srat al-Ghshiya.",
  "Praise -- which is the attribution [to a person] of that which is beautiful -- is established [as something that], belongs to God [alone], exalted be He. Now, is the intention here to point this out for the purpose of believing in it, or to praise [God] thereby, or both? All are possibilities, the most profitable of which is [to understand] the third [as being the intention behind this statement]; Who has revealed to His servant, Muhammad (s), the Book, the Qur\u0027n, and has not allowed for it, that is, [He has not allowed that there be] in it, any crookedness, [any] variance or contradiction (the [last] sentence [wa-lam yaj\u0060al lahu \u0060iwajan] is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-kitb, \u0060the Book\u0027);",
  "[a Book] upright, (qayyiman is a second circumstantial qualifier for [added] emphasis) to warn of, to make, by this Book, the disbelievers fear, severe chastisement from Him, from God, and to bring to the believers who perform righteous deeds the good tidings that theirs will be a fair reward,",
  "wherein they will abide forever, and this [reward] is Paradise;",
  "and to warn those, from among the disbelievers, who say, \u0060God has taken a son\u0027.",
  "They do not have, in this, in this saying, any knowledge, nor did their fathers, before them, who [also] used to say this. Dreadful, grave, is the word that comes out of their mouths (kalimatan, \u0060word\u0027, is for specification and it explains the unidentified [feminine] person [of the verb, kaburat, \u0060dreadful\u0027]; and that which is the object of censure has been omitted, and that is their above-mentioned saying [that God has taken a son]). They speak nothing, thereby, but, an utterance of, lies.",
  "Yet it may be that you will consume, destroy, yourself in their wake -- following [your being with] them, that is, after they have left you -- if they should not believe in this discourse, [in this] Qur\u0027n, out of grief, out of rage and anguish on your part, because of your eagerness that they believe (asafan, \u0060out of grief\u0027, is in the accusative because it functions as an object denoting reason).",
  "Truly We have made all that is on the earth, in the way of animals, plants, trees, rivers and so on, as an adornment for it, that We may try them, that We may test mankind observing thereby, which of them is best in conduct, therein, that is, [to see which of them] is the most abstemious of it.",
  "And indeed We shall turn all that is therein into barren shreds, that produce no plants.",
  "Or did you think, did you suppose, that the Companions of the Cave, the cavern in the mountain, and the Inscription, the tablet wherein their names and lineages had been inscribed -- the Prophet (s) had been asked about their tale -- were, with regard to their tale, a [unique] marvel from among, the entirety [of], Our signs? (\u0060ajaban, \u0060a marvel\u0027 is the predicate of [the defective verb] kna [sc. kn], the preceding [min ytin, \u0060from among Our signs\u0027] being a circumstantial qualifier). In other words, [did you suppose] that they were a marvel exclusively from among all [Our] other signs, or that they were the most marvellous among them? Not so.",
  "Mention, when the youths took refuge in the Cave (fitya, \u0060youths\u0027, is the plural of fat, and denotes a mature young man) fearing for their faith from their disbelieving people, they said, \u0060Our Lord! Give us mercy from Yourself and remedy for us our affair through rectitude\u0027, [through Your] guidance.",
  "So We smote their ears, that is, We made them sleep, in the Cave for several years, for a [fixed] number of years.",
  "Then We aroused them, We awakened them, that We might know, a knowledge of direct vision, which of the two parties, the two groups in disagreement over the length of their stay [in the cave], was better in calculating (ahs is [of the pattern] of af\u0060al, meaning \u0060more precise\u0027]) what they had tarried (li-m labith is semantically connected to the following) in [terms of the] length of time (amadan, [in the accusative] denotes purpose).",
  "We relate, recite, to you their story with truth, that is, truthfully. They were indeed youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.",
  "And We strengthened their hearts, to [enable them to] speak the truth, when they stood up, before their king, who had commanded them to prostrate to idols, and said, \u0060Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will not call on any god besides Him, that is, other than Him, for then we shall certainly have uttered an outrage, in other words, [we shall have spoken] a statement that contains shatat, meaning one of extreme disbelief, were we, hypothetically, to call on any god other than God.",
  "These (h\u0027l\u0027 is the subject [of the sentence]) our people (qawmun is an explicative supplement [to the subject]) have taken gods besides Him. Why [if what they claim is true] do they not bring some clear warrant, some manifest argument, regarding them? regarding worship of these [idols]. And who does greater wrong -- in other words, no one does greater wrong -- than he who invents a lie against God?, by ascribing partners to Him, exalted be He. Some among the youths said to the others:",
  "And when you withdraw from them and from that which they worship except God, then take refuge in the Cave. Your Lord will reveal for you something of His mercy and prepare for you in your affair some comfort\u0027 (read mirfaqan or marfiqan), that is to say, something for you to find comfort in, in the way of lunch or supper.",
  "And you might have seen the sun, when it rose, inclining (read tazzwaru or tazwaru) away from their Cave towards the right, side of it, and, when it set, go past them on the left, avoid them and pass over them, so that it does not fall on them at all, while they were in a cavern therein, in an ample space inside the Cave where the coolness and the gentle breeze of the winds reached them. That, which is mentioned, was [one] of God\u0027s signs, [one of] the proofs of His power. Whomever God guides, he indeed is rightly guided, and whomever He leads astray, you will not find for him a guiding friend.",
  "And you would have supposed them -- had you seen them -- awake, that is, conscious, because their eyes were open (ayqz, \u0060awake\u0027, is the plural of yaqiz), though they were asleep (ruqd is the plural of rqid). And We caused them to turn over to the right and to the left, lest the earth consume their flesh, and their dog [lay] stretching its forelegs, his paws, on the threshold, at the opening of the cave: whenever they turned over it would turn over just like them, both during sleep and consciousness. If you had observed them you would have turned away from them in flight and you would have been filled (read la-mulli\u0027ta or la- muli\u0027ta) with awe because of them (read ru\u0060ban or ru\u0060uban, \u0060awe\u0027): [it was] through this awe that God protected them from anyone entering upon them.",
  "And so, just as We did with them that which We have mentioned, it was that We aroused them, We awakened them, that they might question one another, concerning their state and the length of their stay [in the cave]. One of them said, \u0060How long have you tarried?\u0027 They said, \u0060We have tarried a day, or part of a day\u0027: [he said this] because they had entered the cave at sunrise and were awakened at sunset, and so they thought that it was [the time of] sunset on the day of their entry. Then, they said, unsure about this [fact], \u0060Your Lord knows best how long you have tarried. Now send one of you with this silver coin of yours (read bi-warqikum or bi-wariqikum) to the city -- which is said to be the one now called Tarsus (Tarass) -- and let him see which is the purest food, that is, which of the foods of the city is the purest, and [let him] bring you a supply thereof. Let him be careful and not make anyone aware of you.",
  "For indeed if they should come to know of you, they will [either] stone you, kill you by stoning, or make you return to their creed, and then, if you do return to their creed, you will never prosper\u0027.",
  "And so, just as We aroused them, it was that We disclosed them, [to] their people and the believers, that they, that is, their people, might know that God\u0027s promise, of resurrection, is true: by virtue of the fact that One Who has the power to make them sleep for [such] a long period of time, or sustain them in that state without nourishment, also has the power to resurrect the dead; and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt, no uncertainty, concerning it. Behold (idh adverbially qualifies a\u0060tharn, \u0060We disclosed\u0027) they were disputing, that is, the believers and the disbelievers, among themselves their affair, the affair of the youths, with regard to building something around them [as a monument]; so they, the disbelievers, said, \u0060Build over them, that is, around them, a building, to cover them up; their Lord knows them best.\u0027 Those who prevailed regarding their affair, the affair of the youths, namely, the believers, \u0060We will verily set up over them, around them, a place of worship\u0027, for prayers to be performed therein. And this indeed took place at the entrance of the cave.",
  "They will say, that is, [some of] those disputing the number of the youths [of the cave] at the time of the Prophet (s), in other words, some of these will say that they [the youths] were: \u0060Three; their dog the fourth of them\u0027; and they, some [others] among them, will say, \u0060Five; their dog the sixth of them\u0027 -- both of these sayings were those of the Christians of Najrn -- guessing at random, in other words, out of supposition, not having been present with them [at the time], and this [statement \u0060guessing at random\u0027] refers back to both sayings, and is in the accusative because it is an object denoting reason, in other words, [they said this] for the reason that they were [merely] supposing it. And they, that is, the believers, will say, \u0060Seven; and their dog the eighth of them\u0027 (the sentence is [part of] the subject clause, the predicate of which is the adjectival qualification of sab\u0060a, \u0060seven\u0027 [namely, thminuhum, \u0060the eighth of them\u0027] with the additional ww [wa- thminuhum], which is said to be for emphasis, or an indication that the adjective is [semantically] attached to that which it is qualifying). The qualification of the first two sayings as being \u0060random\u0027, but not the third, is proof that [the latter] is the satisfactory and correct [number]. Say: \u0060My Lord knows best their number, and none knows them except a few\u0027: Ibn \u0060Abbs said, \u0060I am [one] of these \u0022few\u0022 [described]\u0027, and he mentioned that they were seven. So do not contend concerning them except with an outward manner [of contention], [except] with that which has been revealed to you, and do not question concerning them, do not ask for opinions [from], any of them, [from] the People of the Scripture, the Jews. The people of Mecca asked him [the Prophet] about the story of the People of the Cave, and so he said to them, \u0060I will tell you about it tomorrow\u0027, but without adding [the words], \u0060If God wills\u0027 (insh\u0027a\u0027 Llhu) and so the following was revealed:",
  "And never say regarding something, that is, for the purpose of [doing] something, \u0060I will indeed do that tomorrow\u0027, in other words, [I will do something] at some future [point] in time,",
  "without [adding], \u0060If God will\u0027, in other words, unless [firmly] adhering to the will of God, exalted be He, by saying, \u0060If God will\u0027 (insh\u0027a\u0027Llh). And remember your Lord, that is, [remember] His will, making [things] conditional on it, if you forget, to make [things] conditional on it: mentioning it after forgetting [it] is the equal [in validity] to mentioning it at the time of the statement -- as al-Hasan [al-Basr] and others have said -- as long as the person is still in the [same] place [in which he made the statement]. And say, \u0060May be my Lord will guide me to [something] closer [in time] than this, [closer] than the story of the People of the Cave, as an indication of [the truth of] my prophethood, by way of guidance, and God indeed did so.",
  "And they tarried in the Cave three hundred (read [with tanwn] thalthami\u0027atin) years (sinn is an explicative supplement to thalthami\u0027atin, \u0060three hundred\u0027): these three hundred years in the case of the People of the Cave were solar years; but for [the number of] lunar ones, the Arabs add nine years thereto, and this is mentioned in His saying: and add nine, that is, nine years; in other words three hundred solar years, while three hundred and nine lunar ones.",
  "Say: \u0060God is more knowledgeable of how long they tarried, [more knowledgeable] than those contending over this [issue] -- and this [fact] has already been mentioned [above, verse 19]. To Him belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth, that is, [to Him belongs] the knowledge thereof. How well He sees!, namely, God -- this form is for [expressing] amazement [at something]. How well He hears!, likewise [for expressing amazement]. These two [expressions] are being used metaphorically. What is meant is that nothing can escape God\u0027s sight or hearing. They, the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, have no guardian, someone to assist [them], besides Him, and He makes none to share in His rule\u0027, for He is Independent, without need of a partner.",

And do not obey him whose heart We have made oblivious to Our remembrance, that is, [to] the Qur\u0027n -- this was \u0060Uyayna b. Hisn and his companions -- and who follows his own whim, by attributing partners [to God], and whose conduct is [mere] prodigality, excess.",
  "And say, to him and to his companions that this Qur\u0027n is, \u0060The truth [that comes] from your Lord; so whoever will, let him believe, and whoever will, let him disbelieve\u0027 -- this is [meant as] a threat to them. Indeed We have prepared for the wrongdoers, that is, the disbelievers, a Fire, and they will be surrounded by its pavilion, [by] that which encloses [the Fire itself]. If they cry out for help, they will be succoured with water like molten copper, like thick [burning] oil, which scalds faces, because of [the intensity of] its heat, if it is brought near them. What an evil drink, that is, and how ill, is the Fire [as], a resting-place! (murtafaqan is a specification derived from the agent of the verb, in other words, vile is the person choosing to rest thereon; and this is in contrast to what He will say next about Paradise: How fair a resting-place [below, verse 31].

How excellent a reward, a requital, is Paradise, and how fair a resting-place!",
  "And strike, coin, for them, for the disbelievers together with the believers, a similitude: two men (rajulayn is a substitute [for mathalan, \u0060a similitude\u0027] and constitutes, together with what follows, an explanation of the similitude), to one of whom, the disbeliever, We had assigned two gardens, orchards, of vines, and We had surrounded them with date-palms and had set between them [a field of] crops, from which he acquired [his] food supplies.",
  "Each of the two gardens (kilt, \u0060each [of the two]\u0027 is a singular [noun] that indicates a dual [number]; and [the entire clause] is the subject) yielded (tat is the predicate thereof) its produce, its fruit, without stinting, diminishing, anything thereof.

  "And he entered his garden, [taking] with him his companion, accompanying him all around it, showing him its fruits -- God does not say [here] his \u0060two gardens\u0027, because what is meant is the beautiful [part of the] garden (rawda); or because [to mention just] one suffices -- having wronged himself, through [his] disbelief. He said, \u0060I do not think that [all] this will ever perish, become non-existent.",
  "Moreover, I do not think that the Hour will ever come; and [even] if I am indeed returned to my Lord, in the Hereafter, according to your claim, I shall surely find better than this as a resort\u0027, as a [place of] return.",
  "His companion said to him, as he conversed with him, responding to him: \u0060Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you of dust -- as Adam was created of it -- then of a drop of fluid, [of] semen, then fashioned you, made you upright and gave you the form of, a man?",

Will you then take him and his offspring -- this address is to Adam and his progeny (the [final pronominal suffix] h\u0027 in both words refers to Ibls) for your patrons instead of Me, obeying them, when they are an enemy to you?, in other words, [when they are your] enemies (wa-hum lakum \u0060aduwwun is a circumstantial qualifier).

  "And, mention, when Moses, son of Amram (\u0060Imrn), said to his lad, Joshua son of Nun (Ysha\u0060 bin Nn), who used to follow him around, serve him and acquire knowledge from him, \u0060I will not give up, I will not stop journeying, until I have reached the juncture of the two seas -- the point where the Byzantine sea and the Persian sea meet, beyond the east, -- though I march on for ages\u0027, for a very long time before reaching it, if it be far.",
  "So when they reached a juncture between the two, between the two seas, they forgot their fish -- Joshua forgot his luggage [leaving it behind] at the moment of departure, and Moses forgot to remind him -- and so it, the fish, made its way into the sea, that is, it formed it -- through God\u0027s forming it -- by burrowing, that is, like [through] a burrow, which is a passage that is long and enclosed; this was [so] because God, exalted be He, held back the flow of the water [preventing it] from [engulfing] the fish and it [the water] withdrew from around it [the fish] and remained thus like a cleft without closing, and what was beneath it [the cleft] stood still.",
  "And when they had made the traverse, of that location, having journeyed until the morning of the following day, he, Moses, said to his lad, \u0060Bring us our breakfast, (ghad\u0027) that [meal] which is consumed at the beginning of the day. We have certainly encountered on this journey of ours much fatigue\u0027, exhaustion, which took its effect [on them] after the traverse.",
  "He said, \u0060Do you see? -- in other words, remember, when we sheltered at the rock, in that location, indeed I forgot the fish -- and none but Satan made me forget (al-shaytn, \u0060Satan\u0027, substitutes for the [suffixed pronoun] h\u0027 [of ansn-hu]) to mention it (an adhkurahu, an inclusive substitution, in other words [it should be understood as] ansn dhikrahu, \u0060he [Satan] made me forget the mentioning of it\u0027) -- and it, the fish, made its way into the sea in an amazing manner\u0027 (\u0060ajaban constitutes the second direct object), that is to say, Moses and his lad were amazed by it, because of what has already been explained concerning it.",
  "Said he, Moses, \u0060That, namely, our losing the fish, is what we have been seeking!\u0027, what we have been after, for it is a sign for us of the presence of the one whom we seek. So they turned back, retracing their footsteps, until they reached the rock.",
  "So [there] they found one of Our servants, namely, al-Khidr, to whom We had given mercy from Us -- according to one opinion this [mercy] was prophethood; according to another it was authority, and this [latter] is the opinion of the majority of scholars -- and We had taught him knowledge from Us (\u0060ilman is the second direct object), in other words, some knowledge of unseen things; al-Bukhr reports the [following] hadth: \u0060Moses was delivering a sermon among the Children of Israel and was asked, \u0022Who is the most knowledgeable of people?\u0022, to which he [Moses] said, \u0022Myself\u0022. God then reproached him for not having attributed [his] knowledge as [coming] from Him. God then revealed to him the following: \u0022Truly, there is a servant of Mine at the juncture of the two seas; he is more knowledgeable than you\u0022. Moses then asked, \u0022My Lord, how do I reach him?\u0022 He [God] said, \u0060Take a fish with you and place it in a basket and [the place] where you lose the fish will be [the place] where he is.\u0022 He [Moses] took a fish and placed it in a basket and departed together with his lad Joshua son of Nun until they reached the rock. [There] they placed their heads back and fell asleep. The fish began to move about in the basket, until it escaped from it and fell into the sea, and it made its way into the sea in an amazing manner. God then held back the flow of the water [preventing it] from [engulfing] the fish, forming a kind of arch over it. When he awoke, his companion [Joshua] forgot to inform him of [what had happened to] the fish, and so they journeyed on for the remainder of that day and night until on the morning [of the second day] Moses said to his lad, \u0060Bring us our breakfast\u0027, to where he says, and it made its way into the sea in an amazing manner\u0027. He [Bukhr] said, \u0060For the fish, it [the way into the sea] was [by] \u0060burrowing\u0027 (saraban), and for Moses and his lad it [this way] was \u0060amazing\u0027 (\u0060ajaban) ...\u0027 [and so on] to the end [of Bukhr\u0027s report].",
  "Moses said to him, \u0060May I follow you for the purpose that you teach me of what you have been taught [in the way] of probity?\u0027, namely, [something] of right conduct through which I might be rightly-guided (a variant reading [for rashadan] has rushdan, \u0060probity\u0027); he asked him this because to increase [one\u0027s] knowledge is [something which is] always sought.",
  "Said he, \u0060Truly you will not be able to bear with me.",
  "And how can you bear with that whereof you have never been informed?\u0027: in the above-mentioned hadth [of Bukhr] after this verse [there is the following statement]: \u0060O Moses, I possess knowledge which God has taught me and which you do not have, and [equally] you possess knowledge which God has taught you and which I do not have\u0027. (His saying khubran, \u0060informed\u0027, is a verbal noun meaning that which you have never encompassed, in other words, the truth of which you have never been informed of.)",
  "He said, \u0060You will find me, God willing, patient, and I will not disobey, in other words, and [you will also find me] non-disobedient [towards], you in any matter\u0027, with which you charge me. He [Moses] made this [statement] conditional upon the Will [of God] because he was not confident of himself in what he had committed himself to. Indeed, this is the custom of prophets and saints, namely, that they do not put their trust in themselves for a single moment.",
  "He said, \u0060If you follow me then do not question me (l tas\u0027aln, a variant reading has l tas\u0027alann) concerning anything, that you might find objectionable in what I do, according to your [limited] knowledge, and be patient, until I [myself] make mention of it to you\u0027, in other words, [until] I mention it to you with [an explication of] the reason for it. Moses accepted his precondition bearing in mind the respect which a student should exercise in the presence of a teacher.",
  "So they set off, making their way on foot along the coast of the sea, until, when they embarked on the ship, which was carrying them, he, al-Khidr, made a hole in it, by destroying a plank or two on the starboard side with an axe after they had sailed into deep waters. Said he, Moses, to him, \u0060Did you make a hole in it to drown its people? (li-tughriqa ahlah, \u0060for you to drown its people\u0027; a variant reading has li-yaghraqa ahluh, \u0060so that its people might drown\u0027). You have certainly done a dreadful thing\u0027, that is, a grave and reprehensible thing -- it is reported that the water did not [actually] penetrate it.",
  "He said, \u0060Did I not say [that] you would not be able to bear with me?\u0027",
  "He said, \u0060Do not take me to task on account of that which I forgot, that is, [on account of the fact that] I was not mindful of submitting to you [in the matter] and of refraining from showing disapproval of your actions, and do not exhaust me, [do not] charge me, in this affair of mine with difficulty\u0027, [with] hardship during my companionship of you, in other words, treat me throughout it with forgiveness and indulgence.",
  "So they set off, after leaving the ship, making their way on foot, until, when they met a boy, who had not yet reached puberty, playing with [other] boys, among whom his face was the fairest -- and he, al-Khidr, slew him, by slitting his throat with a knife while he lay down, or by tearing his head off with his hand, or by smashing his head against a wall, all of which are [different] opinions (the coordinating f\u0027 [of fa-qatalahu, \u0060and he slew him\u0027] is used here because [it indicates that] the slaying took place after the encounter; the response to idh, \u0060when\u0027 is [the following statement, qla ...]) -- he, Moses, said, to him: \u0060Have you slain an innocent soul, that is, a pure one that had not reached the age of [legal] responsibility (a variant reading [for zkiya] has zakiyya), [one slain] not in retaliation for another soul?, in other words, one that has not slain any soul. Verily you have committed an dreadful thing\u0027 (read nukran or nukuran), that is to say, an abomination.",
  "He said, \u0060Did I not say to you that you would never be able to bear with me?\u0027 (laka, \u0060to you\u0027, has been added to that [same statement] which was made before because this time there could not be any excuse [for Moses\u0027s impatience].",
  "And for this reason, he said, \u0060If I ask you about anything after this, after this instance, then do not keep me in your company, do not allow me to follow you, for truly you [will] have found from me (read ladunn or ladun), on my part, [sufficient enough] excuse\u0027, for you to part company with me.",
  "So they set off, until, when they came to the folk of a [certain] town, namely, Antioch (Antkya), they asked its folk for food, they asked them for food by way of hospitality, but they refused to extend them any hospitality. They then found in it a wall, one hundred cubits high, about to collapse, that is, it was close to falling down because of its tilt; so he, al-Khidr, straightened it, with his [own] hands. He, Moses, said, to him, \u0060Had you wished, you could have taken (a variant reading [for la-ttakhadhta] has la-takhidhta) a wage for it\u0027, some [sort of] payment, since they did not extend us any hospitality despite our need for food.",
  "Said he, al-Khidr, to him, \u0060This is the parting, that is, the moment for parting, between me and you (bayn wa-baynika, here [the preposition] bayna has been annexed to a non-multiple [noun], but this is allowed [grammatically] because it is then repeated with [its other noun together with] the coordinating ww). I will inform you, before I part company with you, the interpretation of that over which you were not able to maintain patience.",
  "As for the ship, it belonged to poor people, ten [in number], who earned a living on the sea, with it, leasing it [to others], as a way of gaining [a living]; and I wanted to make it defective, for behind them, whenever they returned -- or [meaning] before them now -- was a king, a disbeliever, seizing every ship, that was usable, by force (ghasban, is in the accusative as a verbal noun containing an explanation of the nature of such \u0060seizure\u0027).",
  "And as for the boy, his parents were believers and We feared lest he should overwhelm them with insolence and disbelief -- for he is as [described] by the hadth of Muslim, \u0060He was [incorrigibly] disposed to disbelief, and had he lived [longer] this [disposition of his] would have oppressed them, because of their love for him, they would have followed him in such [a path of disbelief]\u0027.",
  "So We desired that their Lord should give them in exchange (read yubaddilahum or yubdilahum) one better than him in purity, that is, in righteousness and God-fearing, and closer, than him, to mercy (read ruhman or ruhuman, in other words [it is to be understood as] rahmatan, \u0060by way of mercy\u0027) namely, [closer to] dutifulness towards his parents. Thus God, exalted be He, gave them in exchange a girl, who [afterwards] married a prophet and gave birth to a prophet through whom God guided an entire community.",
  "And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys [who lived] in the city, and beneath it there was a treasure, a buried trove of gold and silver, belonging to them. Their father had been a righteous man, and so because of his righteousness they were protected both in [terms of] their souls and their possessions, and your Lord desired that they should come of age, that is, [He desired for them] the attainment of maturity, and extract their treasure as a mercy from your Lord (rahmatan min rabbik is a direct object denoting reason, operated by [the verb] arda, \u0060He desired\u0027). And I did not do it, namely, what has been mentioned of [his] making a hole in the ship, the slaying of the boy and the repair of the wall, of my own accord, that is, [out of] my own choosing; nay, it was because of a command in the form of an inspiration from God. This is the interpretation of that over which you could not maintain patience\u0027 (one may say ist\u0060a or istat\u0060a to mean \u0060he had the capacity for [something]\u0027; in this instance and the previous one both forms [of the verb] have been used. Moreover, there is a variety of expression in the use of fa-aradtu, \u0060I desired\u0027, fa-aradn, \u0060We desired\u0027, and fa-arda rabbuk, \u0060Your Lord desired\u0027).",
  "And they, the Jews, question you concerning Dh\u0027l-Qarnayn, whose name was Alexander; he was not a prophet. Say: \u0060I shall recite, relate, to you a mention, an account, of him\u0027, of his affair.",
  "Indeed We empowered him throughout the land, by facilitating [for him] the journeying therein, and We gave him to everything, of which one might have need, a way, a route to lead him to that which he sought.",
  "And he followed a way, he took a route towards the west,",
  "until, when he reached the setting of the sun, the place where it sets, he found it setting in a muddy spring (\u0060ayn hami\u0027a: [a spring] containing ham\u0027a, which is black clay): its setting in a spring is [described as seen] from the perspective of the eye, for otherwise it is far larger [in size] than this world; and he found by it, that is, [by] the spring, a folk, of disbelievers. We said, \u0060O Dh\u0027l-Qarnayn -- by [means of] inspiration -- either chastise, the folk, by slaying [them], or treat them kindly\u0027, by [merely] taking them captive.",
  "He said, \u0060As for him who does wrong, by way of [practising] idolatry, we shall chastise him, We shall slay him. Then he shall be returned to his Lord and He shall chastise him with an awful chastisement (read nukran or nukuran), that is, a severe [one], in the Fire.",
  "But as for him who believes and acts righteously, he shall have the fairest reward, namely, Paradise (the annexation construction [jaz\u0027u l-husn, \u0060the fairest reward\u0027] is explicative; a variant reading has jaz\u0027an al- husn, \u0060[he shall have] as a requital that which is fairest\u0027; al-Farr\u0027 said that this accusative [reading of jaz\u0027an] is [intended] as an explanation [of the nature of the requital] by way of attribution [to \u0060that which is fairest\u0027]; and we shall speak to him mildly in our command\u0027, that is to say, we shall command him with what he will find easy [to bear].",
  "Then he followed a way, towards the east,",
  "until, when he reached the rising of the sun, the place where it rises, he found it rising on a folk, namely, Negroes (zanj), for whom We had not provided against it, that is, [against] the sun, any [form of] cover, in the way of clothing or roofing, as their land could not support any structures; they had underground tunnels into which they would disappear at the rising of the sun and out of which they would emerge when it was at its highest point [in the sky].",
  "So [it was], in other words, the situation was as We have stated; and We encompassed whatever pertained to him, that is, what Dh\u0027l-Qarnayn possessed in the way of machinery, men and otherwise, in knowledge.",
  "Then he followed a way,",
  "until, when he reached between the two barriers (read al-saddayn or al-suddayn here and [likewise] further below [at verse 94, saddan or suddan]) -- [these were] two mountains [lying] in the remote regions beyond the land of the Turks; Alexander sealed the breach between the two, as will be described [below] -- he found on this side of them, that is, in front of them, a folk that could scarcely comprehend speech, in other words, they could only understand it after much agonising (a variant reading [for yafqahna, \u0060comprehend\u0027] has yufqihna, \u0060be understood\u0027).",
  "They said, \u0060O Dh\u0027l-Qarnayn, truly Gog and Magog (read Ya\u0027jj wa-Ma\u0027jj or Yjj wa-Mjj: these two are non-Arabic names of two tribes and are therefore indeclinable) are causing corruption in the land, plundering and oppressing [us] when they come forth to attack us. So shall we pay you a tribute, some [form of] payment (a variant reading [for kharjan] is kharjan), on condition that you build between us and them a barrier?, an obstruction, so that they will not be able to reach us.",
  "He said, \u0060That, wealth and so on, wherewith my Lord has empowered me (makkann, a variant reading has makkanan) is better, than the tribute that you offer me, and so I have no need for it. I shall build for you the barrier without [demanding] a fee; so help me with strength, in that which I [will] demand from you, and I will build between you and them a rampart, a fortified barricade.",
  "Bring me ingots of iron!\u0027, namely, pieces thereof, as large as the [blocks of] stone to be used in the construction; he used these [ingots] in his construction, placing between them firewood and coal. Until, when he had levelled up [the gap] between the two flanks (read al-sudufayn, or al-sadafayn or al-sudfayn, meaning, the two flanks of the two mountains) he set up bellows and [lit a] fire around this [construction] -- he said, \u0060Blow!\u0027, and they blew, until, when he had made it, namely, the iron, a fire, that is, like a fire, he said, \u0060Bring me molten copper to pour over it\u0027 (the two verbs [tn, \u0060bring me\u0027, and ufrigh, \u0060pour\u0027] are in contention over this [direct object, qitran, \u0060molten copper\u0027]; it [this direct object] has been omitted before the first [verb] because it is being governed by the second [verb]). Thus he poured the molten copper over the hot iron so that it penetrated between the [individual] ingots, making a [solid] single whole.",
  "And so they, Gog and Magog, were not able to scale it, to climb up its length, because of its [great] height and smoothness, nor could they pierce it, because of its firmness and thickness.",
  "Said he, Dh\u0027l-Qarnayn, \u0060This, namely, the barrier, the ability to make it, is a mercy from my Lord, a grace [from Him], because it prevents them from coming forth. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, [the promise] of their coming forth, which will be near [the time of] the Resurrection, He will level it, pulverised and flattened, for my Lord\u0027s promise, of their coming forth and [of] other things, is [always] true\u0027, it will be. God, exalted be He says:",
  "And on that day, the day of their coming forth, We shall let some of them surge against others, mixing with one another, on account of their multitude, and the Trumpet, namely, the Horn signalling the Resurrection, shall be blown and We shall gather them, namely, creatures, in one place, on the Day of Resurrection, a [single] gathering.",
  "And on that day We shall present, We shall bring close, Hell to the disbelievers, plain to view,",
  "those [disbelievers] whose eyes (alladhna knat a\u0060yunuhum substitutes for al-kfirna, \u0060the disbelievers\u0027) were masked from My remembrance, namely, the Qur\u0027n, such that they were blind, unable to be guided thereby, and who could not [bear to] hear, that is to say, they were unable to listen to what the Prophet used to recite to them, out of spite for him, and so they did not believe therein.",
  "Do the disbelievers reckon that they can take My servants, namely, My angels, [as well as] Jesus and Ezra, as patrons, as lords, beside Me? (awliy\u0027a, \u0060as patrons\u0027, constitutes the second [direct] object of [the verb] yattakhidh, \u0060that they can take\u0027; the second direct object of [the verb] hasiba, \u0060reckon\u0027, has been omitted). The meaning is: do they suppose that the mentioned \u0060taking [as patrons]\u0027 will not incur My wrath and that I will not punish them for this? No! Truly We have prepared Hell for the disbelievers, these [the ones mentioned above] and others, as [a place of] hospitality, in other words, it has been prepared for them just as a house is prepared for a guest.",
  "Say: \u0060Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers in [regard to] their works? (al-akhsarna a\u0060mlan, a specification that happens to correspond to that which is specifically meant); and these [losers] are described in His words [as being]:",
  "Those whose effort goes astray in the life of this world, [those] whose deeds are invalid, while they reckon, they think, that they are doing good work, [good] deeds for which they will be rewarded.",
  "Those are they who disbelieve in the signs of their Lord, in the proofs of His Oneness, [proofs] such as the Qur\u0027n and otherwise, and the encounter with Him\u0027, that is, and [who disbelieve] in resurrection, reckoning, reward and punishment. So their works have failed, they are invalid, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall not assign any weight to them, in other words, We shall not accord them any value.",
  "That, namely, the matter which I [God] have mentioned concerning the failure of their deeds and so on (dhlika, \u0060that\u0027, constitutes the subject) is their requital -- Hell -- because they disbelieved and took My signs and My messengers in mockery, that is to say, [taking] both of them as something to be derided.",
  "Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds -- theirs will be, according to God\u0027s prescience, the gardens of Firdaws, which are at the centre of Paradise and [at] its highest part (the annexation thereto [of firdaws to jannt, \u0060gardens\u0027] is explicative) as [a place of] hospitality, as an abode;",
  "wherein they will abide, with no desire, demand, to be removed from them, to be transferred to some other [gardens].",
  "Say: \u0060If the sea, in other words, [if] its waters, were ink (midd is what one writes with) for the Words of my Lord, [Words] that testify to His laws and His marvels, such that these [Words] are written with it, the sea would be spent, in recording them, before the Words of my Lord were spent (read as tanfada or yanfada) even though We brought the like of it, namely, [the like of] the sea, as replenishment\u0027, in order to add it to the other [sea], it would [also] be spent, while they [God\u0027s Words] would not be exhausted (madadan, \u0060as replenishment\u0027, in the accusative because it is a specification).",
  "Say: \u0060I am only a human being, a son of Adam, like you; it has been revealed to me that your God is only One God (annam, the anna assimilated with the m retains [its function of referring to] the verbal noun), in other words, the Oneness of the Divine is [what is being] revealed to me. So whoever hopes to encounter his Lord, through the Resurrection and the Requital, let him do righteous work and not associate with the worship of his Lord, that is to say, [let him not commit idolatry] in [performing] it by feigning [faith] before, anyone\u0027. Meccan, except for verses 58 and 71, which are Medinese; it consists of 98, or 99, verses and was revealed after [srat] Ftir.",

  "when (idh is semantically connected to rahma, \u0060mercy\u0027) he called out to his Lord a call, entailing a supplication, in secret, in the middle of the night, because this [time of the night] invites a faster response [to one\u0027s supplication].",
  "He said, \u0060My Lord, truly the bones, all [the bones], within me have become feeble, weak, and my head is alight with grey hair (shayban, a specification derived from the subject of the verb in other words, hoariness has spread throughout his hairs just as a spark of fire spreads through firewood) and I wish to supplicate to you, and I have never been in my supplications to You, my Lord, unsuccessful, that is, [I have never been] disappointed, in the past, so do not disappoint me in what follows.",
  "And truly I fear my kinsfolk, namely, those who will succeed me [as closest after me] in kinship, such as [my] paternal cousins, after me, that is, after my death, [I fear] for the religion, lest they forsake it, as You have witnessed in the case of the Children of Israel, in the way that they changed [their] religion, and my wife is barren, she does not conceive. So grant me from Yourself a successor, a son,",

  "God, exalted be He, in responding to his request for a son that will be the incarnation of His mercy, says: \u0060O Zachariah! Indeed We give you good tidings of a boy, who will inherit in the way that you have requested -- whose name is John. Never before have We made anyone his namesake\u0027, that is, [never has there been] anyone with the name \u0060John\u0027.",

  "He said, \u0060It, the matter [in question], of creating a boy from both of you, shall be so! Your Lord says, \u0022It is easy for Me, namely, to restore your sexual potency and tear open your wife\u0027s womb [in preparation] for conception, for I certainly created you before when you were nothing\u0022\u0027, [you were nothing] before your created form became manifest. As God wished to manifest this great power, He inspired him [the form of] the question, in order for him to receive the response that will indicate it [this power]. And when his soul yearned for the prompt arrival of that whereof he had been given good tidings:",
  "He said, \u0060Lord, appoint for me some sign\u0027, namely, some indication of my wife\u0027s becoming pregnant. Said He, \u0060Your sign, for this, is that you shall not speak to people, that is, that you [should] refrain from speaking to them, but not [from speaking] the remembrance of God, exalted be He, for three nights, that is, together with the days thereof, as [stated] in [srat] l \u0060Imrn, \u0060for three days\u0027 [Q. 3:41], while [you are] in sound health\u0027 (sawiyyan, a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb tukallima, \u0060you shall [not] speak\u0027) in other words, despite there being no defect [in you].",
  "So he emerged before his people from the sanctuary, that is, from the temple -- they had been waiting for him to open it in order to perform [their] prayers therein after his command, as was the custom -- and signalled, indicated, to them, \u0060Make glorifications, perform prayers, at morning and evening\u0027, at the beginning of the day and [at] its end, as per usual. He then realised, upon his being prevented from speaking to them, that she was pregnant with John.",
  "And two years after his birth, God, exalted be He, said to him: \u0060O John! Hold on to the Scripture, namely, the Torah, firmly\u0027, earnestly. And We gave him judgement, prophethood, while still a child, a three-year old;",

  "And mention in the Book, [in] the Qur\u0027n, Mary, that is, [mention] her tale, when she withdrew from her family to an easterly place, that is, [when] she secluded herself in a place on the east side of [her] home.",
  "Thus she veiled herself from them, she draped herself in a veil to conceal herself while she washed her hair [from lice], or [washed] her clothes, or cleansed herself from her menses; whereupon We sent to her Our Spirit, Gabriel, and he assumed before her, after she donned her clothes, the likeness of a well-proportioned human, perfect in physical form.",
  "She said, \u0060Lo! I seek refuge in the Compassionate One from you! If you fear God\u0027, and leave me alone on account of my invocation of refuge in God.",

  "He said, \u0060It, the matter in question, of creating a boy from you without a father, shall be so! Your Lord has said: \u0022It is easy for Me, in other words, by Gabriel\u0027s breathing into you, by My command, so that you become pregnant with him -- since what has been mentioned is meant as a reason, the following [statement] is added as a supplement thereto: and so that We may make him a sign for mankind, of Our power, and a mercy from Us, to whoever believes in him. And it, the creation of him, is a thing [already] decreed\u0022\u0027, according to My knowledge. So Gabriel breathed into the opening of her shirt, whereupon she sensed the formed foetus in her womb.",
  "Thus she conceived him and then withdrew, retreated, with him to a distant place, far from her family.",
  "And the birth pangs, the pains of childbirth, brought her to the trunk of the palm-tree, that she may support herself against it, and then she gave birth: the conception, formation [of the foetus] and delivery [all] took place within one hour.

  "Then he called her from below her, namely, Gabriel -- for he was lower than her, \u0060Do not grieve. Your Lord has made below you a rivulet, a river of water, which had dried up.",
  "And shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards you, [a palm-tree] which had withered (the bi- [in bi-jidh\u0060i\u0027l- nakhlati, \u0060the trunk of the palm-tree] is extra) -- there will drop (tusqit, originally this is tatasqat, but the second t\u0027 is changed into a sn and is assimilated with the [second] sn; a variant reading omits it [the second t\u0027] altogether) on you dates (rutaban, a specification) fresh and ripe (janiyyan, an adjectival qualification of it [of rutaban, \u0060dates\u0027]).",

  "It is not [befitting] for God to take to Himself a son. Glory be to Him -- in affirmation of His being transcendent above [doing] such a thing. When He decrees a thing, that is, [when] He will for it to happen, He only says to it, \u0060Be!\u0027, and it is (read fa-yaknu because of an implied [pronoun] huwa [sc. fa-huwa yaknu]; or read fa-yakna because of an implied an [sc. an yakna]).

This, that has been mentioned, is a straight path, a route leading to Paradise.",
  "But the factions differed among themselves, that is to say, the Christians, [they differed] regarding Jesus: was he the son of God? A god alongside Him? Or [was he] the third of three [gods]? So woe -- [meaning] severe punishment [will be meted out] -- to those who disbelieve, [those who disbelieve] in the way mentioned and in other ways, at the scene of an awful Day, that is to say, [woe to them] when they are present at the Day of Resurrection and [witnessing] its terrors.",

Yet the evildoers (an example of a proper noun [\u0060evildoers\u0027] replacing a third person pronominalisation) today, that is, in this world, are in manifest error, that is, [error] that is evident therein, having been deaf [unable] to listen to the truth and blind [unable] to see it. In other words, [the meaning is]: O you, the one being addressed, marvel at how [well] they will [be able to] hear and see in the Hereafter after they had been deaf and blind in this world.",
  "And warn them, threaten, O Muhammad (s), the disbelievers of Mecca, of the Day of Regret, namely, the Day of Resurrection, on which the sinner will regret not having been virtuous in [the life of] this world, when the matter will be decided, for them thereupon, that they be chastised, while they, in this world, are [yet] heedless, of it, and do not believe, in it [the Day of Resurrection].",

  "O my father! Do not worship Satan, by obeying him through [your] worship of idols. Truly Satan is disobedient ([the intensive form\u0060asiyyan] means \u0060one given to disobedience\u0027) to the Compassionate One.",
  "O my father! I do fear lest a chastisement from the Compassionate One should befall you, if you do not repent, and then you become an ally of Satan, an assistant and a comrade [of his] in the Fire.",
  "He said, \u0060Are you renouncing my gods, O Abraham?, so that you are denouncing them [in this way]? If you do not desist, from criticising them, I shall surely assail you, with stones, or with evil words, so beware of me; and stay away from me for a long time\u0027.",
  "He said, \u0060Peace be to you, from me -- in other words, I shall not cause you any harm. I shall ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Truly He is ever gracious to me (hafiyyan, from hafiyyun, meaning brrun, \u0060kind\u0027) answering my prayers. And indeed he [Abraham] fulfilled his above-mentioned promise [as described] in [srat] al-Shu\u0060ar\u0027, And forgive my father [Q. 26:86]; but this was before it became clear to him that he [Abraham\u0027s father] was an enemy of God, as mentioned in [srat] Bar\u0027a [Q. 9:114].",
  "And I shall shun you and that which you call upon, [that which] you worship, besides God. I will supplicate, I will worship, my Lord -- hopefully in calling upon, in worshipping, my Lord I shall not be wretched\u0027, as you have become wretched by your worship of idols.",
  "And so after he had shunned them and that which they worshipped besides God, by having set off to the Holy Land, We gave him, two sons for him to find solace in, Isaac and Jacob, and each, of the two, We made a prophet.",
  "And We gave them, all three [of them], out of Our mercy, wealth and offspring, and We assigned for them a worthy repute [one] that is lofty, sublime, namely, [We assigned] fair praise [of them] among all the members of the [Abrahamic] religions.",
  "And mention in the Book Moses. Indeed he was devoted [to God] (read either as mukhlisan, to mean \u0060one sincerely devoted to worship [of God]\u0027; or read mukhlasan, [to mean \u0060he was delivered\u0027] as in God had delivered him from defilement) and he was a messenger, a prophet.",

  "And mention in the Book Ishmael. Indeed he was true to his promise -- he never promised anything which he did not fulfil; he [once] waited for three days for someone whom he had promised [to meet]; or [it is said that he waited] an entire year until that person [finally] returned to the place in which he [Ishamel] was [supposed to have met the former]; and he was a messenger, to [the tribe of] Jurhum, a prophet [likewise].",
  "He used to enjoin upon his kinsfolk, that is, his people, prayer and the [payment of] alms, and he was pleasing to his Lord (mardiyyan, \u0060pleasing\u0027, is actually marduwwun, but both ww letters have been changed to two y\u0027 letters, while the kasra vowel [has also been changed to] a damma vowel).",

I lean, I support myself, upon it, when I leap [across something] or walk, and I beat down [leaves], I strike the leaves on trees, with it, so that they fall, for my sheep, which then consume them; and I have uses for it (ma\u0027rib, \u0060uses\u0027, is the plural of ma\u0027ruba, with the r\u0027 taking any [one] of the three vowels [sc. ma\u0027ruba, ma\u0027raba or ma\u0027riba] meaning \u0060needs\u0027) in other ways, such as [using it] to carry food supplies and waterskins, as well as to drive away [undesirable] animals. He [Moses] gives an extensive response to indicate his [many] needs for it.",
  "He said, \u0060Cast it down, O Moses!\u0027",
  "And he cast it down, and lo! it was a serpent, a giant snake, moving swiftly, moving about on its belly swiftly with the speed of a small snake -- which is called al-jnn and which is [also] used to refer to this [serpent] in another verse [Q. 27:10; Q. 28:31].",
  "He said, \u0060Take [hold of] it and do not fear, it. We will restore it to its former state (sratah, in the accusative because the genitive-operating preposition has been removed). And so he placed his hand in its mouth and it became a staff once again; and it became clear that the place into which he put his hand was the place where it [the staff] is held, between its two prongs. Moses was shown this [miracle] lest he be terrified when it turns into a snake in the presence of Pharaoh.",
  "And thrust your hand, the right one, meaning, the palm, into your flank -- that is, your left side, below the arm into the armpit, and [then] take it out -- it will emerge white, in contrast to the skin-colour that it was, without any fault, that is, [without any sign of] leprosy, radiating like the rays of the sun, blinding to the eyes [of onlookers]. [That is] yet another sign (yatan ukhr: this together with bayd\u0027a, \u0060white\u0027, constitute two circumstantial qualifiers referring to the subject of [the verb] takhruj, \u0060it will emerge\u0027).",
  "That We may show you, thereby, when you do this [as described above] in order to manifest it, of Our greatest signs, the sign that is the greatest proof of [the truth of] your Mission [from God]: and should he want it to be restored to its former state, he would thrust it into his armpit, as has been mentioned, and [then] bring it out.",
  "Go, as a messenger [from God], to Pharaoh, and [to] those with him. He has indeed transgressed\u0027, he has exceeded the [usual] limits in his disbelief by claiming to be a god.",
  "He said, \u0060My Lord, expand my breast for me, expand it so that it may accommodate the [weight of the Divine] Message.",
  "And make easy, facilitate, for me my affair, that I may deliver it.",
  "And undo the knot upon my tongue -- the result of his having been burnt by a live coal which he had placed [accidentally] in his mouth as a child;",
  "so that they may understand what I [shall] say, when I am delivering the Message.",
  "And appoint for me a minister, an assistant for that [task], from my family,",
  "Aaron (Hrna, constitutes the second object), my brother (akh, an explicative supplement).",
  "Confirm through him my strength, my courage;",
  "and let him share in my affair, namely, in [the delivery of] the Message (both verbs [ushdud, \u0060confirm\u0027, and ashrikhu, \u0060let him share\u0027] are in the imperative and in the apocopated imperfect tense, constituting the response to the request [of Moses]).",
  "So that we may glorify You, [by making] glorifications, over and over again,",
  "and remember You, [by making] remembrance, over and over again.",
  "Indeed You are ever Seeing of us\u0027, ever Knowing, having been gracious [to us] by way of [appointing us to deliver] the Message.",
  "He said, \u0060You have been granted your request, O Moses!, as a favour [from Us] to you.",
  "And certainly, We have done you a favour [already] another time,",
  "when (idh, for explanation [of that favour]) We revealed to your mother, either in [her] sleep or by way of inspiration -- when she gave birth to you and feared that Pharaoh would have you slain for being one of the newborn [of the Children of Israel] -- that which was revealed, regarding your affair (this [m yh, \u0060that which was revealed\u0027] is substituted by [what follows, an iqdhifhi ...]),",
  "\u0022Cast him, place him, in the ark, then cast him, [while] in the ark, into the river, [into] the flow of the Nile, and then the river shall throw him up onto the shore, that is, its bank (the imperative here [fa\u0027l-yulqihi, \u0060let it throw him\u0027] functions as a predicate); [there] an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his, namely, Pharaoh, shall take him\u0022. And, after he took you, I cast upon you love from Me, that you may be loved by people; and indeed Pharaoh, and all who saw you, loved you; and that you might be reared under My eyes, be nurtured under My guardianship and My protection of you.",
  "When (idh, for explanation) your sister, Maryam, walked up, to obtain news of you, for they had brought wet nurses [for you] but you would not take to the breast of any of them, and she then said, \u0022Shall I show you someone who will take care of him?\u0022. Her offer was accepted and so she brought [them] his mother and he took to her breasts. Thus We restored you to your mother that her eyes might rejoice, in seeing you again, and not grieve, at that point [anymore]. Then you slew a soul, namely, the Copt in Egypt -- and you became distressed for having slain him because of [how] Pharaoh [would react]; whereupon We delivered you from [great] distress, and We tried you with various ordeals, We tested you by landing you in some other [ordeal] and [again] delivered you from it. Then you stayed for several years, ten [years], among the people of Midian, after you had reached it having left Egypt, [staying] with the prophet Shu\u0060ayb and marrying his daughter. Then you came [hither] as ordained, in My knowledge, with the Message [that you will deliver] -- and this was when you were forty years old, O Moses!",
  "And I chose you for Myself, to deliver the Message.",
  "Go, you and your brother, to the people, with My, nine, signs, and do not flag, be remiss, in remembrance of Me, by uttering glorifications and otherwise.",
  "Go the two of you to Pharaoh. Truly he has transgressed [the bounds], in claiming to be the Lord.",
  "And speak to him gentle words, for him to renounce such [claims], that perhaps he may be mindful, be admonished, or fear\u0027, God and so repent -- the \u0060hope\u0027 [for Pharaoh\u0027s repentance] is [expressed] from their perspective, for God knows that he was not going to repent.",
  "The two [of them] said, \u0060Our Lord, We truly fear that he may forestall us, that is, by hastening to punish us, or become tyrannical\u0027, against us, that is, be high-handed [with us].",
  "He said, \u0060Do not fear, for I shall be with the two of you, by [providing you with] My assistance, hearing, what he says, and seeing, what he does.",
  "So go to him and say, \u0022Truly we are two messengers of your Lord, so let the Children of Israel go with us, to Syria, and do not [continue to] chastise them, in other words, release them from your exploitation of them in those oppressive works of yours, such as digging, construction and the lifting of heavy objects. We have verily brought you a sign, a definitive argument, from your Lord, as proof of our truthfulness in [delivering] the Message; and may peace be upon him who follows [right] guidance, that is to say, may he be secure from [God\u0027s] chastisement.",
  "Indeed it has been revealed to us that the chastisement shall befall him who denies, [the truth of] what we have brought, and turns away\u0022 \u0027, [and who] rejects it. And so they came to him and said [to him] all of what has been mentioned.",
  "He said, \u0060So who is your Lord, O Moses?\u0027 -- he [Pharaoh] restricted this [question] to him [Moses], because [between him and Aaron] he is the principal [bearer of God\u0027s Message] and also because of his [Pharaoh\u0027s] having pampered him while he was being reared [as a child].",
  "He said, \u0060Our Lord is He Who gave to everything, in creation, its [peculiar] nature, through which it is distinguished from another [thing], and then guided [it]\u0027, the animal among them to its source of food, drink and procreation and in other ways.",
  "He, Pharaoh, said, \u0060So what of, the status [of], the generations, the communities, of old?\u0027, such as the people of Noah, Hd, Lot and Slih, with regard to their having worshipped graven images.",
  "Said he, Moses, \u0060The knowledge thereof, that is, the knowledge of their [otherworldly] status, is, preserved, with my Lord, in a Book, namely, the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahfz), and He shall requite them in accordance with it on the Day of Resurrection. My Lord does not err, He is [never] absent from anything, nor does He, my Lord, forget, anything.",
  "He is, the One Who made for you, as well as [for] all creatures, the earth a cradle, a bed, and threaded, facilitated, for you therein ways, roads, and sent down from the heaven water, rain. God, exalted be He, says, as a complement to Moses\u0027s description of Him and as an address to the people of Mecca: and therewith We brought forth various kinds, species, of plants (shatt, \u0060various\u0027, adjectivally qualifies azwjan, \u0060kinds\u0027), in other words, [plants] of different colours, flavours and [different] in other ways (shatt is the plural of shatt, similar [in pattern] to mard, [plural] mard, as [may be used] in [a phrase like] shatta al- amr, \u0060the affair has become divided\u0027).",
  "Eat, thereof, and pasture your cattle, therein (an\u0060m, \u0060cattle\u0027, is the plural of na\u0060am, which are camels, cows and sheep; one says ra\u0060atu\u0027l-an\u0060mu, \u0060the cattle grazed\u0027 or ra\u0060aytuh, \u0060I grazed them\u0027; the imperative here is meant as a permissive and a reminder of [God\u0027s] grace, the sentence being a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of [the verb] akhrajn, \u0060We brought forth\u0027, in other words [what is meant is], \u0060[We brought forth the plants] permitting you to eat thereof and to graze [your] cattle [thereon]\u0027). In that, which is mentioned here, there are indeed signs, indeed lessons, for people of sense, possessors of intellect (al- nuh, the plural of nuhya, similar [in pattern] to ghurfa, [plural] ghuraf. The intellect is called by this [term, nuhya] because it shows a person the sense to refrain from committing vile deeds).",
  "From it, that is, from the earth, We created you, by creating your father Adam from it, and into it We shall restore you, [when you are] interred after death, and from it We shall bring you forth, at the Resurrection, a second time\u0027, in the same way that We brought you forth [from it] when We initiated your creation.",
  "And verily We showed him, that is, We made Pharaoh see, all Our signs, [all] nine, but he denied, them, and claimed that they were [the result of] sorcery, and refused, to affirm the Oneness [of God], exalted be He.",
  "He said, \u0060Have you come to us so that you may expel us from our land, Egypt, and so that kingship over it may be yours, by your sorcery, O Moses?",
  "Yet We [too] shall produce for you a sorcery like it, [one] which will counter it. So fix a tryst between us and you, for that [purpose], [a tryst] which neither we nor you shall fail to keep, [at] a place (maknan is in the accusative because the genitive-operator preposition [f, \u0060at\u0027] has been removed) of equal distance (read siwn or suwn), in other words, in the middle, equidistant for a person coming from either side.",
  "Said he, Moses, \u0060Your tryst shall be the Day of Adornment -- a festive day of theirs on which they adorn themselves and [the public] assemble -- and let the people assemble, [let] the inhabitants of Egypt gather, at forenoon\u0027, the time for this [tryst], to observe what will transpire.",
  "Then Pharaoh withdrew, retreated, and summoned up his guile, that is to say, those [human] elements of his guile from among the sorcerers, and then came, with them to the tryst.",
  "Moses said to them -- and there were 72 of them, each with a rope and a staff in his hand -- \u0060Woe to you!, meaning, may God make you liable to woe. Do not invent a lie against God, by ascribing partners to Him, lest He annihilate you (read fa-yushitakum or fa-yashatakum) by some chastisement, from Him. For verily he who invents lies, against God, fails\u0027, [he] is the loser.",
  "So they disputed their matter among themselves, regarding Moses and his brother, and kept secret their private counsel, that is, their conversation regarding the two,",
  "They said, to each other, \u0060These two men (hdhn, this [form] concords with the forms used by those [grammarians] who use the alif [ending] for all three cases of the dual person; Ab \u0060Amr has [the variant reading] hdhayn) are indeed sorcerers who intend to expel you from your land by their sorcery, and do away with your excellent traditions (muthl, the feminine form of amthal, meaning \u0060the noblest\u0027) in other words, [they will do away with the loyalty of] the noblemen among you, because these [latter] will prefer the two of them [Moses and Aaron] on account of their triumph.",
  "So summon up your guile, in the way of sorcery (read fa\u0027jma\u0060, from [the first form] jama\u0060a, meaning \u0060he gathered\u0027, or read fa-ajmi\u0060, from [the fourth form] ajma\u0060a, meaning \u0060he resolved [to do something]\u0027) and come in battle-line (saffan, a circumstantial qualifier, meaning \u0060standing in rows\u0027). For truly he who is uppermost, [he who] triumphs, this day shall be the victor!\u0027",
  "They said, \u0060O Moses, you choose: either cast, your staff first, or we shall be the first to cast\u0027, their staff.",
  "He said, \u0060Nay, you cast!\u0027, and so they cast, and lo! their ropes and their staffs (\u0060isiyyihim: derives from \u0060iswwun, but the two ww [letters] have been changed into two y\u0027 [letters], with the kasra vowelling applied to both the \u0060ayn and the sd) appeared to him by [the effect of] their sorcery as though they were, snakes, gliding swiftly, on their bellies.",
  "And Moses sensed fear within himself, that is to say, he feared that if [the effect of] their sorcery was of the same kind as his miracle, he would become suspect in people\u0027s minds and they would not believe in him.",
  "We said, to him, \u0060Do not be afraid! Indeed you shall have the upper hand, over them by triumphing.",
  "And cast that which is in your right hand -- and this was his staff. It shall swallow up that which they have produced. For what they have produced is only a sorcerer\u0027s trick, that is to say, a kind thereof, and the sorcerer does not succeed wherever he may go\u0027, in his sorcery. So Moses cast his staff and it swallowed up all of that which they [had] produced.",
  "Thereat the sorcerers cast [their heads] down prostrating, they fell down prostrating to God, exalted be He: They said, \u0060We [now] believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses\u0027.",
  "Said he, Pharaoh, \u0060Do you profess belief (read a-mantum pronouncing both hamzas, or with the second changed to an alif) in him before I, myself, give you permission? He is indeed your chief, your teacher, who taught you sorcery. I shall assuredly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides (min khilfin, a circumstantial qualifier meaning \u0060alternate [hands and feet]\u0027, in other words, the right hands and the left feet) and I shall assuredly crucify you on the trunks of palm trees. And you shall then know which of us -- meaning himself and the Lord of Moses -- is harsher in [inflicting] chastisement, and [which of us is] more lasting\u0027, more enduring in [sustaining] opposition to him [Moses].",
  "They said, \u0060We will not choose you over what has come to us of clear signs, proving the truthfulness of Moses, and [over] Him Who originated us, created us (wa\u0027lladh fatarana, either an oath, or a supplement to [the preceding] m, \u0060what\u0027). Decree what you will decree, that is, do what you say. What you decree is only [relevant] in the life of this world (al-hayta\u0027l-duny, is in the accusative because the scope [of his decree] is being indicated, in other words \u0060[you can only decree] in it\u0027); yet you will be requited for it in the Hereafter.",
  "Indeed We profess belief in our Lord, that He may forgive us our sins, in the way of ascribing partners [to God] and otherwise, and the sorcery to which you forced us, to learn and to perform in order to oppose Moses. And God is better, than you in rewarding if he is obeyed, and more enduring\u0027, than you in chastisement if he is disobeyed.",
  "God, exalted be He, says: Truly whoever comes to his Lord a criminal, a disbeliever, like Pharaoh, for him there shall be Hell wherein he shall neither die, and thus find rest, nor live, a life of any benefit to him.",
  "And whoever comes to Him a believer, having performed righteous deeds -- the obligatory and supererogatory deeds, for such shall be the highest degrees (al-\u0060ul, the plural of \u0060uly, the feminine form of a\u0060l) --",
  "the Gardens of Eden, that is to say, as a [place of] residence (this [janntu \u0060Adnin, \u0060Gardens of Eden\u0027] is an explication thereof [of al-darajtu\u0027l-\u0060ul, \u0060the highest degrees\u0027]) underneath which rivers flow, abiding therein, and that is the reward of him who keeps pure, of sins.",
  "And verily We revealed to Moses, [saying], \u0060Lead My servants on a journey by night (read as an asri, \u0060that: lead on a journey by night\u0027, from [fourth form] asr, \u0060he travelled by night\u0027; or read as an\u0027isri, from [first form] sar, \u0060he travelled by night\u0027, both being alternative forms), in other words, travel with them by night from the land of Egypt, and strike for them, make for them, by striking your staff, a dry path in the sea. So he fulfilled what he had been commanded, and God made the ground dry so that they were able to pass through it. Do not fear to be overtaken, that is, [fearing] that Pharaoh might catch you, and do not be afraid\u0027, of drowning.",
  "Then Pharaoh pursued them with his hosts, with him [Pharaoh] alongside them, and there engulfed them what did engulf them of the sea, and it drowned them.",
  "And Pharaoh led his people astray, by calling them to worship him, and he did not guide them, nay he led them to destruction, in contrast to what he said [to them], and I guide you only to the path of rectitude [Q. 40:29].",
  "O Children of Israel, truly We delivered you from your enemy, Pharaoh, by drowning him, and We made a tryst with you on the right side of the [Tr] Mount, in order to give Moses the Torah, that it may be implemented it [by you], and We sent down to you manna and quails, namely, turunjabn [citrus fruit] and the quail. The ones being addressed in the vocative [by \u0060O Children of Israel\u0027] are those Jews living at the time of the Prophet (s), and they are addressed with reference to the graces which God bestowed on their forefathers at the time of the prophet Moses as a preface to what God [now] says to them:",
  "\u0060Eat of the good things We have provided you, that is to say, of that which has been bestowed on you as a grace [from God], but do not transgress regarding it, by being ungrateful for the grace thereof, lest My wrath descend on you ([if read] fa-yahilla, it means \u0060[lest] it [My wrath] become incumbent [upon you]\u0027; or [if read] fa-yuhilla, it means \u0060[lest] it descend [on you]\u0027). And he on whom My wrath descends (read yahlil, \u0060becomes incumbent\u0027, or yahlul, \u0060descends\u0027) certainly perishes, falls into the Fire.",
  "And indeed I am Forgiving toward him who repents, from ascribing partners [to God], and believes, affirms God\u0027s Oneness, and acts righteously, is sincere in [performing] the obligatory and the supererogatory [deeds], and then follows guidance\u0027, by adhering to what has been mentioned up to his death.",
  "\u0060And what has hurried you [to depart] from your people, in order to come to the appointed time to receive the Torah, O Moses?\u0027",
  "He said, \u0060They are close, behind me, coming, upon my track, and I hastened to You, my Lord, that You may be pleased\u0027, with me, in other words, to please you [even] more -- before [giving] the response, he gives an excuse, according to what he supposed [was the situation with his people],",
  "But those he supposed [to be following him] had remained behind, for He, exalted be He, said, \u0060Indeed We tried your people after you, that is, after your departure from them, and the Samaritan led them astray\u0027, so they took to worshipping the [golden] calf.",
  "Thereupon Moses returned to his people, angry, with them, and sad, extremely grieved. He said, \u0060O my people, did not your Lord promise you a fair promise?, that is, a true [promise] that He will give you the Torah? Did the period, the length of my absence from you, seem too long for you, or did you desire that wrath should become incumbent against you from your Lord, by your worship of the [golden] calf, and so you broke your tryst with me?\u0027, and failed to follow after me?",
  "They said, \u0060We did not break our tryst with you of our own accord (read the mm with any of the three vowellings, meaning \u0060by our own power\u0027 or \u0060of our own will\u0027), but we were laden with (read hamaln, \u0060we carried\u0027, or hummiln, \u0060we were made to carry\u0027) the burdens, the weight, of the people\u0027s ornaments, of the trinkets of Pharaoh\u0027s folk -- which the Children of Israel had borrowed from them on the pretext of [using them for] a wedding, but which had remained with them -- and we cast them, we threw them into the fire at the command of the Samaritan, and so, just as We cast, did the Samaritan cast, what he had on him of their trinkets together with the dust that he took from the track left by the hoof of Gabriel\u0027s steed, as follows:",
  "Then he produced for them a calf, which he fashioned from the [melted] trinkets -- a [mere] body, of flesh and blood, with a low, in other words, [it made] a sound that was audible; it was transformed into such [a state] because of the dust [from Gabriel\u0027s steed] the effect of which is [to create] life in whatever thing it is placed. After he had fashioned it, he placed it [the dust] in its mouth. And they, namely, the Samaritan and his followers, said, \u0060This is your God and the God of Moses: so he, Moses, forgot\u0027, his Lord here and set off in search of him. God, exalted be He, says:",
  "Did they not see that ([in all] an has been softened in place of the hardened form, with its subject omitted, in other words [it should be] annahu) it, the Calf, did not reciprocate their words, that is, that it did not give them any response in return, nor did it have any power over hurt for them, that is, [any power] to prevent it, or any benefit?, that is, [any power] to procure it [for them], in other words, how can such [a thing] be taken as a god?",
  "And Aaron had certainly said to them beforehand, that is, before the return of Moses, \u0060O my people, you are only being tested thereby! But truly your Lord is the Compassionate One, so follow me, in worship of Him, and obey my command\u0027, therein.",
  "They said, \u0060We will not cease to cling to it, persisting in worship of it, until Moses returns to us\u0027.",
  "He, Moses, said, upon his return, \u0060O Aaron, what held you back when you saw them going astray, by worshipping it,",
  "that ([all] read an [instead], the l being extra) you did not follow me? Did you then disobey my command?\u0027, by remaining among those who worship [something] other than God, exalted be He?",
  "He, Aaron, said, \u0060O son of my mother (read ya\u0027bna\u0027ummi or ya\u0027bna\u0027umma, meaning umm, \u0060my mother\u0027) the mention of her is more effective in provoking the affection of his heart -- do not clutch my beard, which he had seized with his left hand, or my head!, for he had seized his hair with his right hand in anger. Indeed I feared that, if I followed you, for inevitably a group of those who did not worship the calf would have followed me, you would have said, \u0022You have caused division among the Children of Israel -- and have been furious with me -- and you did not wait for my word\u0022\u0027, concerning what my opinion would have been in this matter.",
  "He said, \u0060And what have you to say, what was the motive for [doing] what you did, O Samaritan?\u0027",
  "He said, \u0060I perceived what they did not perceive (read [either as third person plural] yabsur or [as second person plural] tabsur \u0060[what] you [did not] perceive\u0027), in other words, I realised what they did not realise, so I seized a handful, of dust, from the track of, [from] the hoof of the steed of, the messenger, Gabriel, and threw it [in], I cast it onto the figure of the calf that had been fashioned. Thus my soul prompted, [thus] it adorned for, me\u0027 and it was cast into me [the idea] that I seize a handful of the dust from that mentioned [hoof] and cast it onto what possessed no spirit, so that it might [thus] acquire a spirit. I had seen that your people had asked that you make for them a god, and so my soul suggested to me [the idea] that this calf should be their god.",
  "Said he, Moses to him, \u0060Begone! It shall be yours [as your lot] throughout life, that is, for the duration of your life, to say, to whomever you may see, \u0022Do not touch [me]!\u0022, that is, do not come near me -- he used to wander about [aimlessly] throughout the land, and whenever he touched a person, or a person touched him, both would succumb to a fever. And indeed there will be a tryst for you, for you to be chastised, which you will not fail to keep (read lan tukhlifahu, meaning \u0060[a tryst] which you shall not miss\u0027; or lan tukhlafahu, \u0060for which you will not be forgotten\u0027, meaning: \u0060nay you will be sent forth to [keep] it\u0027). Now look at your god to whom you remained clinging! (zalta is actually zalilta, but the first lm has been omitted in order to soften it), that is to say, [you remained] by his [your god\u0027s] side, worshipping him. We will surely burn it, in fire, and then scatter [the ashes of] it into the waters, we will disperse it into the winds of the sea; and, after having slaughtered it, Moses did [exactly] that which he has mentioned.",
  "Indeed your God is the One God, than whom there is no other god. He embraces all things in [His] knowledge\u0027 (\u0060ilman, a specification derived from the subject of the verb, in other words, it means \u0060His knowledge embraces all things\u0027).",
  "Thus, just as We have related to you O Muhammad (s) this story, We relate to you some stories, [some] accounts, of what is past, of communities, and We have given you from Ourselves a Reminder, a Qur\u0027n.",
  "Whoever turns away from it, and does not believe in it, he shall indeed, on the Day of Resurrection, bear a burden, a heavy load of sin;",
  "therein, that is, in the chastisement for [such] sin, abiding. And evil for them on the Day of Resurrection is that burden! (himlan, a specification qualifying the person of [the verb] s\u0027a, \u0060evil\u0027; the subject of derision, the implied wizruhum, \u0060their sin\u0027, has been omitted; the lm [of lahum] is explicative and substitutes for yawma\u0027l-qiyma, \u0060the Day of Resurrection).",
  "The day the Trumpet is blown, the Horn, the Second Blast, and We shall assemble the criminals, the disbelievers, on that day bruised, in the eye along with their faces blackened.",
  "They will whisper to one another, speaking secretly amongst themselves: \u0060You have tarried, in this world, only ten nights\u0027, with the [full ten] days.",
  "We know very well what they will say, regarding this matter -- that is, it is not as they say -- when the justest, the most upright, of them in the way, in this, will say, \u0060You have tarried only a day\u0027: they will deem their stay in this world as having been very brief, on account of the terrors they will witness in the Hereafter.",
  "They will question you concerning the mountains, how will they be on the Day of Resurrection? Say, to them: \u0060My Lord will scatter them as ashes, by pulverising them into moving sand and dispersing them with the wind;",
  "then He will leave them a level hollow, a flattened [level] surface,",
  "wherein you will see neither crookedness, [neither] slope, nor any curving\u0027, [nor] any rise.",
  "On that day, that is, on the day the mountains are scattered as ashes, they will follow, that is, mankind [will follow], after rising from their graves, the Summoner, to the Gathering, by [the call of] his voice -- this [Summoner] will be [the archangel] Isrfl, and he will say: \u0060Forward to the parade before God!\u0027 -- there will be no deviation therein, that is, in the manner in which they follow [him], in other words, they cannot but follow [him]. Voices will be hushed, will become silent, before the Compassionate One, so that you hear nothing but a faint shuffle, the light tread of feet walking towards the Gathering, similar to the sound of the hoofs of camels as they pass.",
  "On that day intercession will not profit, anyone, except [intercession] from him whom the Compassionate One permits, that he intercede for such [a person], and whose word He approves, that is to say, because such [an intercessor] will say, \u0060there is no god but God\u0027 (l ilha ill\u0027Llh).",
  "He knows what is before them, of the affairs of the Hereafter, and behind them, of the affairs of this world, and they do not comprehend such [things] in knowledge: they have no knowledge of such [things].",
  "And faces shall be humbled, they shall be submissive, before the Living, the Eternal Sustainer, namely, God; and he will certainly have failed, he will have lost, [he] who carries [the burden of] evildoing, that is, [of] idolatry.",
  "But whoever does righteous deeds, acts of obedience, being a believer, shall fear neither wrong, by having his evil deeds increased, nor injustice, by having his good deeds diminished.",
  "Thus (kadhlika, a supplement to [the previous] kadhlika naqussu, \u0060thus We relate\u0027 [Q. 20:99]), just as We have revealed what has been mentioned, We have revealed it, that is, the Qur\u0027n, as an Arabic Qur\u0027n, and We have distributed, We have repeated, in it [statements] of threats, so that they may fear, associating others with God, or it, the Qur\u0027n, may arouse in them a remembrance, of the destruction of those communities before, and may thus be admonished.",
  "So exalted be God, the King, the Truth, above what the idolaters say. And do not hasten with the Qur\u0027n, that is, to recite it, before its revelation is completed for you, [before] Gabriel is through delivering it, and say, \u0060My Lord, increase me in knowledge\u0027, that is, [knowledge] of the Qur\u0027n: thus every time something of it was revealed to him his knowledge increased because of it.",
  "And We made a covenant with Adam, We enjoined him not to eat of the tree, before, that is, before he ate of it, but he forgot, he disregarded Our covenant, and We did not find in him any constancy, any resoluteness or patience in [abiding by] what We forbade him from.",
  "And, mention, when We said to the angels, \u0060Prostrate before Adam\u0027; so they prostrated, except Ibls, who was the father of the jinn -- he used to keep company with the angels and worship God alongside them: he refused, to prostrate before Adam, he said: \u0060I am better than him\u0027 [Q. 7:12].",
  "Then We said, \u0060Adam, indeed this is an enemy of yours and of your wife, Eve (read Haww\u0027). So do not let him cause you both to be expelled from the Garden, so that you then toil, [so that you then] become fatigued by [the toil of] tillage, sowing, harvesting, milling, baking and otherwise -- the statement is restricted to [the mention of] his [Adam\u0027s] \u0060toil\u0027 because it is the man who has to strive [to provide] for his wife.",
  "It is indeed [assured] for you that you will neither be hungry therein nor go naked,",
  "And it is indeed [assured] for you (read wa-annaka or wa-innaka, as a supplement to the subject of inna [sc. laka, that is, \u0060you\u0027] and its clause) neither to be thirsty therein, nor to suffer the sun\u0027: you will not be exposed to any heat of a midday sun, for there is no sun in Paradise.",
  "Then Satan whispered to him saying, \u0060O Adam, shall I guide you to the Tree of Immortality, which gives everlasting life to the one who eats thereof, and a kingdom that does not waste away?\u0027, that does not perish while he remains immortal.",
  "So both of them, Adam and Eve, ate of it, and their shameful parts were exposed to them, that is, the front [private part] of each became visible to the other, as well as the other\u0027s behind -- both of these [parts] are called saw\u0027a, \u0060shame\u0027, because its exposure \u0060shames\u0027 (yas\u0027u) that person); and they began to piece together, they took to sticking, onto themselves leaves of the Garden, to cover themselves up therewith. And Adam disobeyed his Lord and so he erred, by [his] eating from the tree.",
  "Thereafter his Lord chose him, He brought him close [to Him], and relented to him, He accepted his repentance, and guided him, that is, He guided him to seek repentance regularly.",
  "He said, \u0060Go down both of you, that is, Adam and Eve, including all of your progeny, from it, from the Garden, all together, some of you, some of the progeny, being enemies of others, because of some wronging others. Yet if (the nn of the conditional particle in has been assimilated with the m, which is extra) there should come to you guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, the Qur\u0027n, shall not go astray, in this world, neither shall he be miserable, in the Hereafter.",
  "But whoever disregards My remembrance, [disregards] the Qur\u0027n and does not believe in it, his shall be a straitened life (read dankan with nunation, a verbal noun meaning \u0060straitened [circumstances]\u0027). This [statement] has been interpreted in one hadth to mean the punishment of the grave for the disbeliever. And on the Day of Resurrection We shall bring him to the assembly, namely, the one who disregards the Qur\u0027n, blind\u0027, blind in eyesight.",
  "He shall say, \u0060My Lord, why have you brought be to the assembly blind, though I used to see?\u0027, in the world and at the raising from the grave?",
  "He will say, \u0060So it, the affair, is. Our signs came to you, but you forgot them, you neglected them and did not believe in them; and so, just as you forgot Our signs, today you will be forgotten\u0027, abandoned in the Fire.",
  "And so, just as We requite him who disregards the Qur\u0027n, We requite him who is prodigal, [him who] associates others with God, and believes not in the signs of his Lord. And the chastisement of the Hereafter is more terrible, than the chastisement of the life of this world and the punishment of the grave, and more enduring, longer lasting.",
  "Is it not a guidance, has it not become clear, to them, to the disbelievers of Mecca, how many (kam, is predicative and the object of [the following] ahlakn) We destroyed, in other words, Our frequent destruction, before them of generations, that is, of past communities, for denying messengers, amid [the ruins of] whose dwelling-places they walk? (yamshna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the pronoun lahum, \u0060to them\u0027) during their journeys to Syria and other places, that they might thus be admonished? (what has been mentioned [by grammarians] regarding the derivation of [the verb] ihlk to be that verb that does not contain a particle referring to [the object of] the action of the verb, as a way of preserving the [original] sense [of the statement], is acceptable). Surely in that there are signs, lessons, for people of sense, for possessors of intellect.",
  "And but for a decree that had already preceded from your Lord, that their chastisement be deferred to the Hereafter, it, destruction, would have been an inevitability, [their destruction] would have been necessary in this world, and a specified term, fixed for them (ajalun musamman, a supplement to the pronoun concealed in kna, \u0060it would have been\u0027, the separation [of both subjects] by the predicate of both serves as an emphasis).",
  "So be patient with what they say -- this is abrogated by the \u0060fighting\u0027 verse [cf. Q. 2:190ff] -- and make glorifications, pray, by praising your Lord (bi-hamdi rabbika is a circumstantial qualifier, in other words, \u0060ensconced in such [praise]\u0027) before the rising of the sun, the morning prayer, and before its setting -- the afternoon prayer -- and in the watches of the night, [during] the hours thereof, and make glorifications, perform the sunset and the evening prayer, and at either side of the day (wa-atrfa\u0027l-nahri, a supplement to the syntactical locus of the accusative clause wa-min n\u0027i, \u0060and in the watches\u0027), in other words, perform the noon prayer, because the time for it begins at the point where the sun starts to go down, which is the [end] side of the first half [of the day] and the [start] side of the second half [of the day]; that perhaps you may be pleased, with the reward that you will be given.",
  "And do not extend your glance toward what We have given to some pairs, [certain] categories, among them to enjoy, [as] the flower of the life of this world, its adornment and delight, that We may try them thereby, [to see] if they transgress [the bounds]. And your Lord\u0027s provision, in Paradise, is better, than what they have been given in this world, and more enduring, longer lasting.",
  "And bid your family to prayer, and be steadfast in [the maintenance of] it. We do not ask of you, We [do not] charge you with [the procurement of], any provision, [either] for yourself or for anyone else. We [it is Who] provide you, and the [best] sequel, Paradise, will be in favour of God-fearing, for such people.",
  "And they, the idolaters, say, \u0060Why does he, Muhammad (s), not bring us a sign from his Lord?\u0027, of the sort which they request. Has there not come to them (read ta\u0027tihim or ya\u0027tihim) the clear proof, the statements, of what is in the former scriptures?, the tales contained in the Qur\u0027n relating to past communities and [the details of] their destruction for denying the messengers?",
  "Had We destroyed them with a chastisement before him, before [the coming of] Muhammad (s) the Messenger, they would have said, on the Day of Resurrection: \u0060Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, so that we might have followed those signs of Yours, given to the messengers [to convey], before we were [thus] abased, at the Resurrection, and disgraced?\u0027, in Hell.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Each, [one] of us and you, is waiting, to [see] what this affair will lead to. So wait! For you shall indeed know, at the Resurrection, who are the followers of the even path, the straight way, and who is [rightly] guided\u0027, away from error, us or you. Meccan: consisting of 112 verses, revealed after srat Ibrhm.",
  "Nigh has drawn for mankind, the people of Mecca, the deniers of the Resurrection, their reckoning, [on] the Day of Resurrection, yet they are heedless, of it, disregardful, of the preparation [required] for it by way of [embracing] faith.",
  "There does not come to them any new reminder from their Lord, [revealed] gradually, in other words, [new] words of the Qur\u0027n, but they listen to it as they play, [as they] engage in mockery,",
  "with their hearts preoccupied, heedless of its meanings. And they are secret in [their] conference, [their] speech, [they] the evildoers (alladhna zalam, a substitution for the [third person plural indicator] ww of wa-asarr\u0027l-najw, \u0060and they are secret in conference\u0027) \u0060Is this, namely, Muhammad (s), other than a [mortal] human being like yourselves?, and so what he produces is [mere] sorcery. Will you then take [to] sorcery, [will] you [succumb and] follow it, even though you are able to see?\u0027, [even though] you know that it is sorcery?",
  "He said, to them, \u0060My Lord knows the words, that are [spoken], in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Hearer, of what they keep secret, the Knower\u0027, of it.",
  "Nay (bal, in the three instances [below] effects a transition from one subject to another) but they say, regarding those parts of the Qur\u0027n he [the Prophet] has brought [to them] are: \u0060A muddle of nightmares, a confusion [of things] he has seen in [his] sleep. Nay, he has fabricated it, he has invented it; nay, he is a poet, and what he has brought is [merely] poetry! So let him bring us a sign, such as was sent to the ancients\u0027, like the she-camel [Slih], the staff and the [glowing] hand [of Moses]. God, exalted be He, says:",
  "No town before them ever believed -- meaning [none of] its inhabitants -- of those that We destroyed, for the denial of the signs brought to them. Would they then believe? No.",
  "And We sent none before you other than men to whom We revealed (read nh or yh, \u0060[to whom] it is revealed\u0027) and [We sent] not any angels. Ask the People of the Remembrance, those with knowledge of the Torah and the Gospel, if you do not know, this; for they will know it. Since you are more likely to believe them than the believers are to believing Muhammad (s).",
  "And We did not make them, namely, the messengers, bodies that did not eat food, nay, they eat it; and they were not immortal, in this world.",
  "Then We fulfilled to them the promise, to deliver them. So We delivered them and whomever We would, [of] those who believed in them, and We destroyed the prodigal, those who denied them.",
  "Now We have sent down [as revelation] to you, O clan of Quraysh, a Book in which there is the remembrance that is yours, for it is in your language. Will you not understand?, and so believe in it?",
  "And how many did We destroy of towns -- meaning its inhabitants -- that had been wrongdoing, disbelieving, and brought forth another people after it!",
  "And when they felt Our might, [when] the inhabitants of the town sensed destruction [to be near], behold, they ran away from it, they flee hastily [therefrom].",
  "But the angels said to them scornfully: \u0060Do not run [away]! Return to the opulence, the comforts, which you were given to enjoy and your dwelling-places, that perhaps you might be asked\u0027, for something of your worldly possessions as usual.",
  "They said, \u0060O (y is for calling attention [to something]) woe to us!, [this is] our destruction! We have indeed been doing wrong\u0027, through [our] disbelief.",
  "So that, saying, remained their cry, which they would make and repeat, until We made them as reaped [crops], as crops harvested with sickles when they were killed with the sword, stilled, dead, like the stillness of fire when it is extinguished.",
  "And We did not create the heaven and the earth and all that is between them, playing, being frivolous, but to indicate Our power and to benefit Our servants.",
  "Had We desired to find some diversion, that which provides diversion, in the way of a partner or a child, We would have found it with Ourselves, from among the beautiful-eyed houris or angels, were We to do [so]. But We did not do so, thus We never desired it.",
  "Nay, but We hurl, We cast, the truth, faith, against falsehood, disbelief, and it obliterates it, and behold, it vanishes, disappears (damaghahu, \u0060it obliterates it\u0027, actually means \u0060it struck the brain with a blow\u0027, [a blow] which is fatal). And for you, O disbelievers of Mecca, there shall be woe, severe chastisement, for what you ascribe, to God, of mate or child.",
  "And to Him, exalted be He, belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth, as possessions, and those who are near Him, namely, the angels (wa-man \u0060indahu, the subject, the predicate of which [is the following clause]) do not disdain to worship Him, nor do they weary.",
  "They glorify [Him] night and day, and they do not falter, in it, for it comes to them as [naturally as] breathing comes to us, [something] which we can never be distracted from.",
  "Or (am, functions with the meaning of bal, \u0060nay\u0027, to effect a transition [in subject-matter]; the hamza is for [rhetorical] denial) have they chosen gods, that are, from the earth, such as stones, gold or silver, who, that is, gods [who], resurrect? who bring the dead back to life? No! Indeed only one who brings the dead back to life can be God.",
  "Had there been in [either of] them, that is, [in] the heavens and the earth, gods other than God, that is, other than Him, the two would have surely deteriorated, they [the heavens and the earth] would have deviated from their observed order, because counteractive forces would exist among such [gods], as is usually the case, when there is more than one ruler, that there is counteraction and a lack of consensus regarding something. So glory be to God -- an exaltation -- the Lord, the Creator, of the Throne, al-kurs, above what they ascribe, the disbelievers, to God, of His having a partner and otherwise.",
  "He shall not be questioned about what He does, but they shall be questioned, about their actions.",
  "Or have they chosen besides Him, exalted be He, other than Him, gods? (herein is an interrogative meant as a rebuke). Say: \u0060Bring your proof, for this -- but such a thing is impossible. This is the Remembrance of those with me, namely, my community, and that [Remembrance] is the Qur\u0027n, and the Remembrance of those before me, of communities, namely, the Torah and the Gospel and other Books of God, not a single one of which contains the statement that with God there exists another god, in the way that they claim -- exalted be He above such a thing. Nay, but most of them do not know the truth, the affirmation of God\u0027s Oneness, and so they are disregardful\u0027, of that discernment that leads to [knowledge of] it.",
  "And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (read nh or yh, \u0060[but] it was revealed to him\u0027) that, \u0060There is no god except Me, so worship Me\u0027, that is, affirm My Oneness.",
  "And they say, \u0060The Compassionate One has taken a son\u0027, from the angels. Glory be to Him! Nay, but they are [merely] servants who are honoured, in His presence; for [the very] servitude [of all creatures to Him] is inconsistent with [the attribution of any of them as] progeny [of His].",
  "They do not [venture to] speak before Him -- they only speak after He has spoken, and they act according to His command, that is, following [His issuing of] it.",
  "He knows what is before them and what is behind them, that is, what they have done and what they will do, and they do not intercede except for him with whom He is satisfied, that he be interceded for, and they, for awe of Him, exalted be He, are apprehensive, fearful.",
  "And should any of them say, \u0060I am a god besides Him\u0027, that is, [besides] God, in other words, [a god] other than Him -- and this is Ibls, who summoned [others] to worship his soul and commanded that it be obeyed -- such a one We will requite with Hell. Thus, in the same way that We requite him, We requite wrong- doers, idolaters.",
  "Have they not ([one may] read a-wa-lam or a-lam) realised, [have they not] come to know, those who disbelieve, that the heavens and the earth were closed together and then We parted them, We made seven heavens and seven earths -- or [it is meant] that the heaven was parted and began to rain, when it did not use to do so, and that the earth was parted and began to produce plants, when it did not use to do so; and We made, of water, [the water] that falls from the heaven and that springs from the earth, every living thing?, in the way of plants and otherwise: in other words, water is the cause of such [things] having life. Will they not then believe?, by affirming My Oneness?",
  "And We set in the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with them, and We set in them, [in] the firm mountains, ravines, as roads (subulan substitutes [for fijjan, \u0060ravines\u0027, which are wide through-routes]), that perhaps they may be guided, to their destinations during travel.",
  "And We made the heaven a roof, for the earth, [functioning] like the roof of a house, preserved, from collapsing; and yet of the signs thereof, namely, [the signs of this heaven such as] the sun, the moon and the stars, they are disregardful, failing to reflect on them and thus realise that the Creator of such [things] can have no partner.",
  "And He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, each (kullun, the nunation of this [particle] stands in place of the second noun [of the genitive construction] that would have been al- shams, \u0060the sun\u0027, or al-qamar, \u0060the moon\u0027, or their subsidiaries, namely, al-nujm, \u0060the stars\u0027) in an orbit, a circular [one] like a mill in the sky, swimming, moving with speed, like a swimmer in water. In order to effect the analogy with the latter, the plural person [of the verb employed] for rational beings is used.",
  "When the disbelievers said that Muhammad (s) would die, the following was revealed: And We did not assign to any human being before you immortality, permanence [of life] in this world. What, if you [are fated to] die, will they be immortal?, in it? No! (The last sentence constitutes the [syntactical] locus of the interrogative of denial).",
  "Every soul shall taste death, in this world, and We will try you, We will test you, with ill and good, such as poverty and wealth, sickness and health, as an ordeal (fitnatan, an object denoting reason, in other words, for the purpose of seeing whether you will be patient and give thanks or not). And then unto Us you shall be brought back, that We may requite you.",
  "And whenever the disbelievers see you, they only take you in derision, that is, as one to be derided, saying: \u0060Is this the one who mentions your gods?\u0027, that is, [the one who] derides them? And yet when it comes to the mention of the Compassionate One, to them, they (hum, [repeated] for emphasis) are disbelieving, of it, saying, \u0060We do not know of any such [individual]\u0027.",
  "The following was revealed regarding their demand that chastisement be hastened: Man was created of haste, that is to say, because he is so hasty in his affairs, it is as if he had been created out of it. Assuredly I shall show you My signs, My promises of chastisement, so do not demand that I hasten, in [sending] it. And so He [God] made them suffer death at [the battle of] Badr.",
  "And they say, \u0060When will this promise, of resurrection, be [fulfilled], if you are truthful?\u0027, about it.",
  "[God] exalted be He, says: If those who disbelieved only knew of the time when they shall not [be able to] ward off, repel, the Fire from their faces, nor from their backs, nor shall they be helped, [nor] shall they be protected from it at the Resurrection (the response to the [conditional particle] law, \u0060if only\u0027, is [something along the lines of] \u0060they would not have said that\u0027).",
  "Nay, but it, the Resurrection, shall come upon them suddenly, dumbfounding them, confusing them, and they shall not be able to ward it off, nor shall they be granted any respite, [nor shall they] be given any [extra] time to make a repentance or offer an excuse.",
  "And verily messengers before you were derided -- herein is a statement to comfort the Prophet (s) -- but those who mocked them were encircled by, it was sent down [against them], that which they used to deride, namely, chastisement -- likewise it shall befall those who have derided you.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Who can guard you, preserve you, by night and day from the Compassionate One?\u0027, from His chastisement, if it should befall you? In other words, no one can do such a thing. Those being addressed [here] do not fear God\u0027s chastisement because they deny [the truth of] it. Nay, but of the Remembrance of their Lord, that is, the Qur\u0027n, they are disregardful, failing to reflect on it.",
  "Or is it that they have (am, \u0060or\u0027, functions with the sense of a hamza used to indicate denial, that is, [read it as] a-lahum, \u0060do they have\u0027) gods to defend them, against that which might cause them harm, besides Us? In other words, do they have anyone other than Us to defend them against such [things]? No! They, namely, the gods, cannot help themselves, and so they will not [be able to] help them; nor shall they, the disbelievers, be protected from Us, from Our chastisement (one may say sahibaka\u0027Llhu, to mean \u0060May God preserve and protect you\u0027).",
  "Nay, but We provided [comforts] for these and their fathers, in the way of the graces which We bestowed on them, until life lasted long for them, so that they were deluded by such [longevity]. Do they not see how We visit the land, [how] We target their land, diminishing it at its edges?, by granting the Prophet victory [through conquest]. Are they the ones who will prevail? No, it is rather the Prophet and his Companions [who will do so].",
  "Say, to them: \u0060I warn you only by the Revelation\u0027, [that comes] from God, and not by my own prompting. But the deaf do not hear the call when (idh, read pronouncing both hamzas fully, or omitting the second [hamza] between it and the y\u0027) they are warned. They are like those who are deaf, when they fail to act in accordance with the warnings they hear.",
  "And if a whiff, a slight instance, of your Lord\u0027s chastisement were to touch them, they would indeed say, \u0060O (y, used for drawing attention [to something]) woe for us!, [O this is] our destruction! Truly we were doing evil\u0027, in ascribing partners to God and denying [the Mission of] Muhammad (s).",
  "And We shall set up the just balances, the equitable ones, for the Day of Resurrection, that is, on it, and no soul shall be wronged in any way, neither by deducting a good deed [from its record], nor by adding [to it] an evil one; and even if it, the action, be the weight of a [single] mustard seed, We shall produce it, with its full weight, and We suffice as reckoners, to count all things.",
  "And verily We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion, the Torah that discriminates between truth and falsehood, and [between] what is lawful and unlawful, and an illumination, by it, and remembrance, an admonition therein, for those who are wary of God,",
  "those who fear their Lord in concealment, from people, that is, when they are in seclusion from them, and who, on account of the Hour, that is, [on account of] its terrors, are apprehensive, fearful.",
  "And this, namely, the Qur\u0027n, is a blessed Remembrance which We have revealed. Will you then deny it? (the interrogative here is intended as a rebuke).",
  "And verily We had given Abraham his rectitude before, that is, his [right] guidance before he came of age -- and We were Aware of him, in that he was deserving of such [guidance],",
  "when he said to his father and his people, \u0060What are these images, [these] idols, to which you [constantly] cleave?\u0027, that is, which you are constantly worshipping.",
  "They said, \u0060We found our fathers worshipping them\u0027, and so we followed their example.",
  "He said, to them, \u0060Truly you and your fathers, by worshipping them, have been in manifest error\u0027.",
  "They said, \u0060Do you bring us the truth, in that which you are saying, or are you being frivolous?\u0027, in this regard.",
  "He said, \u0060Nay, but your Lord, the [only] One worthy of being worshipped, is the Lord, the Owner, of the heavens and the earth, [the One] Who originated them, [Who] created them without any precedent, and to that, which I have said, I am a witness.",
  "And, by God, I shall devise [a stratagem] against your idols after you have gone away, with your backs turned\u0027.",
  "And so, after they had set off to a gathering of theirs on one of their festival days, he reduced them to fragments (read judhdhan or jidhdhan, meaning \u0060pieces\u0027), [smashing them] with a hatchet, [all] except the principal one among them, around whose neck he hung the hatchet, that they might return to it, that is, to the principal one, and see what he had done to the others.",
  "They said, upon returning and seeing what had been done, \u0060Who has done this to our gods? Truly he is an evildoer\u0027, in this regard.",
  "They said, one to the other: \u0060We heard a young man making [ill] mention of them, deriding them -- he is called Abraham\u0027.",
  "They said, \u0060Then bring him before the people\u0027s eyes, that is, openly, that they may testify\u0027, against him as being the perpetrator.",
  "They said, to him, after he had been brought [before them]: \u0060So, is it you (read a-anta, [either] pronouncing fully the two hamzas; or substituting an alif for the second one, or not pronouncing it [the second one], and inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one, or without [this insertion]) who has done this to our gods, O Abraham?\u0027",
  "He said, concealing his deed: \u0060Rather it was this principal one among them did it. So question them, about the perpetrator of this, if they can speak!\u0027 (here the response to the conditional statement precedes [the conditional clause]; in the preceding clause there is an intimation for them that an idol, acknowledged as being incapable of action, cannot be a god).",
  "So they turned [thinking] to themselves, in reflection, and they said, to themselves: \u0060Truly it is you who are the evildoers\u0027, for worshipping that which cannot speak.",
  "Then they were turned, by God, on their heads, that is to say, they were made to return to their disbelief and said, \u0060By God, you are certainly aware that these [idols] cannot speak\u0027, in other words, how can you thus command us to question them?",
  "He said, \u0060Do you then worship, besides God, that is, in His place, that which cannot benefit you in any way, with regard to [granting you] provision and otherwise, nor harm you?, in any way if you were not to worship it?",
  "Fie (read uffin or uffan, with the sense of a verbal noun, meaning \u0060a putrid thing or a vile thing [be]\u0027) on you and what you worship besides God, that is, other than Him. Do you not comprehend?\u0027, that these idols are not worthy of being worshipped and are not fit for such [a purpose] -- only God, exalted be He, is worthy of it.",
  "They said, \u0060Burn him, that is, [burn] Abraham, and stand by your gods, by having him burnt, if you are to do anything\u0027, in the way of standing by them. Thus they gathered lots of firewood and lit a fire throughout it. They then tied up Abraham, placed him in a ballista and had him hurled into the fire. God, exalted be He, says:",
  "We said, \u0060O fire! Be coolness and safety for Abraham!\u0027, and so it only consumed the bonds [with which he had been tied]. Its heat departed, but its luminosity remained. And by His words wa-salman, \u0060and safety\u0027, Abraham was safe from (salima) death because of its coolness.",
  "And they sought to outwit him, namely, by having him burnt, but We made them the greater losers, in what they sought.",
  "And We delivered him, as well as Lot -- son of his [Abraham\u0027s] brother Hrn -- from Iraq, [and brought them] to the land which We have blessed for all peoples, [blessed it] with an abundance of rivers and trees, and this is Syria. Abraham settled in Palestine, and Lot in the Sinful City (al-mu\u0027tafika, cf. Q. 53:53); and between the two is [the distance of] a day\u0027s journey.",
  "And We gave him, namely, Abraham -- for he had asked for a child, as mentioned in [srat] al-Sfft [Q. 37:100] -- Isaac, and Jacob as a gift, that is, as [something] in addition to what was requested; or it means \u0060a grandson\u0027; and each of them, that is, himself and the two born of him, We made righteous, [We made them] prophets.",
  "And We made them leaders (read a-immatan pronouncing both hamzas, or substituting the second one with a y\u0027), whose example of good [conduct] is followed, guiding, people, by Our command, to Our religion, and We inspired in them the performance of good deeds and the maintenance of prayers and the payment of alms, that is, [We inspired] that these [good deeds] be performed, [prayers] be maintained, and [alms] be payed by them and by their followers (the [final] h\u0027 of iqma has been omitted to soften [the reading]), and they used to worship Us.",
  "And to Lot We gave judgement, the ability to judge decisively between opposing parties, and knowledge; and We delivered him from the town which had been committing, that is, whose inhabitants had been committing, deeds of, vileness, by way of homosexual intercourse, hazelnut-hurling and bird-games and other things. Truly they were a folk of evil [people] (saw\u0027 is the verbal noun of s\u0027ahu, \u0060he harmed him\u0027, the opposite of sarrahu, \u0060he delighted him\u0027), immoral.",
  "And We admitted him into Our mercy, by Our saving him from his people. He was indeed one of the righteous.",
  "And, mention, Noah (what follows [Nhan] substitutes for it) when he called, when he supplicated [to God] against his people -- with the words My Lord, do not leave [upon the earth any inhabitant from among the disbelievers] ... to the end [of the verse, Q. 71:26], before, that is, before [the time of] Abraham and Lot. And We responded to him, and delivered him and his people, who were in the Ark with him, from the great agony, namely, [from] drowning and his people\u0027s denial of him.",
  "And We helped him, We defended him, against the people who denied Our signs, the ones indicating his Mission, lest they cause him any harm. They were indeed an evil people, so We drowned them all.",
  "And, mention, David and Solomon, that is, [mention] their story (Dwda wa-Sulaymna is substituted by [the following, idh yahkumni ...]) when they gave judgement concerning the tillage, a field of crops or a vineyard, when the sheep of a [certain] people strayed into it, that is, [when these sheep] grazed there at night, but without a shepherd, because they had escaped; and We were witnesses to their judgement (li- hukmihim shhidna: here the plural person is being used in the case of a dual). David decreed: to the owner of the tillage belong the head of the sheep. Solomon decreed: he shall benefit from [the use of] their milk, offspring and wool until such time as the tillage is restored to its original state at the hands of the owner [of the sheep], after which he [the owner of the tillage] should return them [the sheep] to him [their owner].",
  "And We gave understanding of this, that is, the judgement, to Solomon. [It is said that] both of their decisions were [the result of] independent judgement [exercised by both], and that David consulted Solomon; but it is also said [that their decisions were] by way of inspiration [from God] -- the second [decision] abrogated the first. And to each, of the twain, We gave judgement, prophethood, and knowledge, in matters of religion. And We disposed the mountains to glorify [God] with David, and the birds also, were disposed to glorify [God] with him, for he [David] had commanded such [glorification on their part], so that whenever there was a lapse [on his part], he would [be reminded to] apply himself to the task [of glorifying God] promptly. And We were [certainly] doers, of this disposing of them to glorify [God] along with him, even if it should amaze you, that they should [be able to] respond to the lord David.",
  "And We taught him the art of making garments, namely, coats of mail -- [which are called labs] because they are worn (tulbas). He was the first [human being] to make them; hitherto there were [only] plates [of armour] -- for you, as well as all mankind, to protect you (read nuhsinakum, [the subject being] \u0060God\u0027; or yuhsinakum, [the subject being] \u0060David\u0027; or tuhsinakum, [the subject being] \u0060garments\u0027) against your [mutual] violence, your wars against your enemies. Will you then, O people of Mecca, be thankful?, for My favours, by believing in the Messenger -- in other words, be thankful to Me by [doing] this.",
  "And, We disposed, for Solomon the wind to blow strongly -- in another verse it is [described as being] rukh\u0027an, \u0060to blow softly\u0027 [Q. 38:36]; in other words, [it is either] blowing violently or gently [respectively], according to what he [Solomon] wanted -- making its way, at his command, to the land which We have blessed, namely, Syria; and We have knowledge of all things, among them the fact that God, exalted be He, knew that what He gave to Solomon would prompt him to be subservient to his Lord, and so God did this in accordance with His knowledge.",
  "And, We disposed, of the devils some that dived for him, plunging into the sea and bringing out of it jewels for Solomon, and performed tasks other than that, that is, other than diving, such as building and otherwise. And We were watchful over them, lest they should spoil what they had made, for whenever they completed a task before nightfall, they would [invariably] spoil it, unless they were occupied with some other [task].",
  "And, mention, Job (Ayyba, is substituted by [the following, idh nd rabbahu ...]) when he called out to his Lord -- after he had been afflicted with the loss of all of his possessions and children, the laceration of his body, his being shunned by all except his wife, for a period of thirteen, seventeen, or eighteen years, as well as [the affliction of enduring] a straitened means of livelihood -- \u0060Indeed (read ann because of the implicit y\u0027 [of the first person pronoun]) harm, adversity, has befallen me, and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful\u0027.",
  "So We responded to him, in his call, and removed the harm that had befallen him, and We gave him [back] his family, his male and female children, by bringing them back to life -- of each sex there were three or seven along with them [other children] the like of them, from his wife, for she was made younger. He had also possessed a threshing floor for wheat and another for barley, so God sent two clouds and one of them poured forth gold onto the wheat threshing floor and the other poured forth silver onto the barley threshing floor, until they overflowed; as a mercy (rahmatan, a direct object denoting reason) from Us (min \u0060indin, an adjectival phrase) and a reminder to worshippers, that they be patient and thus be rewarded [by God].",
  "And, mention, Ishmael and Idrs and Dh\u0027l-Kifl -- all were of the patient, in [maintaining] obedience to God and staying away from acts of disobedience to Him.",
  "And We admitted them into Our mercy, through [granting them] prophethood. Indeed they were among the worthy, of it. Dh\u0027l-Kifl was so called because he undertook (takaffala) to fast every day and stay up every night in prayer, and to pass judgement between people without succumbing to anger, and fulfilled this [undertaking]. It is also said, however, that he was not a prophet.",
  "And, mention, Dh\u0027l-Nn, the one of the whale, namely, Jonah son of Amittai (Ynus bin Matt) when he went off enraged ([Dh\u0027l-Nn] is substituted by [the clause idh dhahaba mughdiban]) by his people, that is, furious with them because of what he had suffered at their hands -- even though he had not been granted permission [by God to go off as he did] -- thinking that We had no power over him, that is, that We could [not] compel him to [submit to] Our decree in the way that We did by imprisoning him inside the stomach of the whale; or that We could [not] make circumstances difficult for him. Then he cried out in the darknesses, [through] the darkness of the night, the darkness of the sea and the darkness of the whale\u0027s stomach, that: \u0060There is no god except You! Glory be to You! I have indeed been one of the wrongdoers\u0027, for leaving my people without [Your] permission.",
  "So We responded to him and delivered him from the distress, by [means of] those words, and thus, in the same way that We delivered him, We deliver the believers, from their anguish when they call out to Us seeking succour.",
  "And, mention, Zachariah (Zakariyy, is substituted by [the following, idh nd rabbahu ...]) when he cried out to his Lord, saying: \u0060My Lord, do not leave me without an heir, without a son to inherit from me, and You are the best of inheritors\u0027, the One that endures after all of your creation has perished.",
  "So We responded to him, in his call, and gave him John, as a son, and We restored [fertility to] his wife for him, and so she bore a child, having been barren. Truly they, those prophets that have been mentioned, would hasten to, [they would] hurry [to perform], good works, [namely] acts of obedience, and supplicate Us out of desire, for Our mercy, and in awe, of Our chastisement, and they were submissive before Us, humble in their worship.",
  "And, mention Mary, the one who guarded her virginity, [the one who] preserved it from being taken, so We breathed into her of Our spirit, namely, Gabriel, when he breathed into the opening of her garment and she conceived Jesus. And We made her and her son a sign for all the worlds, that is, [for] mankind, jinn and angels, because she bore him without [having] a male [partner].",
  "\u0060Truly this, creed of Islam, is your community, your religion, O you who are being addressed -- in other words, you must adhere to it as, one community, [this being] a necessary state [of affairs], and I am your Lord, so worship Me\u0027, affirm My Oneness.",
  "But they, that is to say, some of those being addressed, fragmented their affair among themselves, that is, they became divided in the matter of their religion, and at variance over it -- these are the [different] sects of the Jews and the Christians. God, exalted be He, says: All shall return to Us, and We will requite each according to his deeds.",
  "And whoever performs righteous deeds, being a believer -- no rejection, that is, no denial, will there be of his endeavour, and We will indeed write it down for him, by commanding the guardian angels to record it and then We requite him for it.",
  "It is forbidden for any town, meaning [it is forbidden for] its people, which We have destroyed that they should (l yarji\u0060na: the l is extra) return, that is, their return to this world is prohibited.",
  "Until (hatt, [a particle] expressing the end of the prohibition of their return) when Gog and Magog (read Ya\u0027jju wa-Ma\u0027jju or Yjju wa-Mjju, [these are] non-Arabic names of two tribes; there is an implicit genitive annexation before this clause, namely, the [gates of the] sadd, \u0060the barrier\u0027, [built] against them) are let loose (read futihat or futtihat) -- and this will happen near the [time of the] Resurrection -- and they slide down, they hasten, from every slope, [every] highland.",
  "And the true promise, that is, the Day of Resurrection, draws near and behold, when, the gaze of the disbelievers will be fixed, on that Day, because of its severity, saying: \u0060O (y is for exclamation) woe to us!, [this is] our destruction! Verily, in the [life of the] world, we were oblivious to this, Day. Nay, but we were doing wrong\u0027, to our souls by our denial of the messengers.",
  "\u0060Truly you, O people of Mecca, and what you worship besides God, that is, other than Him, in the way of graven images, shall be fuel for Hell, [you shall be] its fodder; and you shall come to it\u0027, [you shall] enter it.",
  "Had these, graven images, been gods, as you claim, they would never have come to it, [they would never have] entered it, and they will all, both the worshippers and the worshipped, abide therein.",
  "For them, for the worshippers, there will be groaning therein and they will not hear in it, anything, because of the ferocity with which it boils. When [\u0060Abd Allh] Ibn al-Ziba\u0060r said, \u0060Ezra, Jesus and the angels were worshipped: they must also be in the Fire then, according to what has just been stated\u0027, the following was revealed:",
  "Indeed those to whom [the promise of] the best reward, the [best] status, went beforehand from Us, and among such are those who have just been mentioned: they will be kept away from it.",
  "They will not hear the faintest sound from it and they will abide in what their souls desired, of bliss.",
  "The Supreme Terror -- which is that a servant be ordered off to the Fire, shall not grieve them, and the angels shall receive them, upon their exiting from their graves, saying to them: \u0060This is your day, the one which you were promised\u0027, during the [life of the] world.",
  "The day (yawma is in the accusative because of an implied preceding udhkur, \u0060mention\u0027) when We shall roll up the heaven as the Scribe, [al-sijill being] the name of an angel, rolls up the written scroll, that is, the scroll of the son of Adam when he dies (the lm [of li\u0027l-kitb] is extra; alternatively, [one may read the verse so that] al-sijill is \u0060the scroll\u0027, and al-kitb means al-maktb \u0060what is written\u0027, in which case the lm [of li\u0027l- kitb] has the sense of [the particle] \u0060al, \u0060over\u0027; a variant reading [for li\u0027l-kitb] has the plural, li\u0027l-kutub, \u0060the books\u0027). As We began the first creation, from non-existence, We shall repeat it, after making it non-existent (the kf [of ka-m, \u0060as\u0027] is semantically connected to nu\u0060du, \u0060We shall repeat [it]\u0027, and its [suffixed] pronoun [-hu, \u0060it\u0027] refers back to awwala, \u0060the first\u0027; the m relates to the verbal noun) -- a promise binding on Us (wa\u0060dan is in the accusative because [it is the direct object] of an implied preceding wa\u0060adn, \u0060We promised\u0027, and [the clause] constitutes a confirmation of the import of the preceding [verse, 103]). Truly We shall do [that], which We have promised.",
  "Certainly We wrote in the Scripture, (al-zabr) means \u0060the Book\u0027, that is, the revealed Books of God, after the Remembrance, meaning the Mother of the Book (umm al-kitb), which is [kept] with God: \u0060Indeed the land, the land of Paradise, shall be inherited by My righteous servants\u0027 -- [this promise] applies to all righteous ones.",
  "Indeed there is in this, Qur\u0027n, a proclamation, sufficient means for [securing] entry into Paradise, for a people who are devout, acting in accordance with [what is stipulated in] it.",
  "We did not send you, O Muhammad (s), except as a mercy, that is, to [give] mercy, to all the worlds, [the worlds of] mankind and jinn through you.",
  "Say: \u0060All that is being revealed to me is that your God is One God, that is, the only thing that is being revealed to me with respect to the Divine is His Oneness. So will you submit?\u0027, [will you] accede to [affirming] the Oneness of the Divine that is being revealed to me? (the interrogative is meant as an imperative).",
  "But if they turn away, from this, say: \u0060I have proclaimed to you, I have notified you of [my declaration of] war [on you], all alike (\u0060al saw\u0027 is a circumstantial qualifier referring to both the subject of the verb and the object) that is to say, you are [all] equal in having knowledge of this: I shall not proceed independently without [having first informed] you, in order for you to make preparations, although I do not know whether near or far is that which you have been promised\u0027, with respect to chastisement, or to the [Day of] Resurrection that comprises this [chastisement]; only God knows it.",
  "Indeed He, exalted be He, knows whatever is spoken aloud, and what you and others do, and He knows what you conceal, both you and others, of secrets.",
  "I do not know; perhaps that, which I have notified you of, but whose time is not known, may be a trial, a test, for you, to see how you will act, and an enjoyment for a while, that is, until your terms of life are concluded (this [second] clause [wa-mat\u0060un, \u0060and an enjoyment\u0027] counters the former, which is the object of the optative expressed by [the particle] la\u0060alla, \u0060perhaps\u0027; the second [clause] cannot be an optative).",

And so they were chastised at [the battles of] Badr, Uhud, Hunayn, al-Ahzb and al-Khandaq and he [the Prophet] was given victory over them. And our Lord is the Compassionate One, Whose help is to be sought against what you allege\u0027, when you invent lies against God, saying that \u0060[God] has taken a son\u0027 [cf. Q. 2:116]; and against me, when you say, \u0060[he is] a sorcerer\u0027 [cf. Q. 38:4], or against the Qur\u0027n, when you say, \u0060[it is] poetry\u0027 [cf. Q. 52:30].

  "O mankind, that is, the inhabitants of Mecca and others: fear your Lord, that is, of His punishment, by being obedient to Him. Surely the earthquake of the Hour [of Doom], that is, the violent quaking of the earth after which the sun will rise from the west, [something] which will be near [the time of] the Hour, is a tremendous thing, in the way it will distress people -- this itself being a sort of punishment.",
  "On the day when you behold it, every, actually, nursing female, on account of this [tremendous day], will neglect her suckling, that is, she will forget it; and every pregnant female will deliver her burden, and you will see mankind [as though] drunk, because of the severity of [their] fear, yet they will not be drunk, because of any drink; but God\u0027s chastisement is severe, and so they will be terrified of it.",
  "The following was revealed regarding al-Nadr b. al-Hrith and his companions: And among mankind are those who dispute about God without any knowledge -- they would say, \u0060The angels are God\u0027s daughters, and the Qur\u0027n [a collection of] the fables of the ancients\u0027. In addition, they would deny resurrection and the bringing back to life of those who had become dust -- and [those who] follow, in their manner of disputing, every rebellious devil,",
  "about whom it has been decreed, in other words, it has been decreed with regards to a devil, that whoever takes him for a friend, that is, [whoever] follows him, he will make him go astray and will lead him, summon him, to the chastisement of the Blaze, namely, to the Fire.",
  "O mankind, in other words, [O] people of Mecca, if you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then lo! [consider that] We have created you, that is, [We have created] your origin -- Adam -- from dust then, We created his progeny, from a drop, a sperm-drop, then from a clot, congealed blood, then from a [little] lump of flesh (mudgha), a piece of flesh, the size of what one would [be able to] chew (m yumdagh), partly formed, shaped, complete in form, and partly unformed, that is, uncomplete in form, that We may make clear to you, the perfect nature of Our power, that you might [then] infer from this initial act of creation, the [reality of its future] restoration. And We establish (nuqirru, marks a new [grammatically independent] sentence) in the wombs whatever We will for a specified time, that is, until the time for it to come out, then We bring you forth, from the bellies of your mothers, as infants, and then, We extend your life, that you may come of age (ashuddakum), that is to say, [your] prime and strength, which is [that age] between thirty and forty years. And there are some of you who are taken away, by death, before coming of age, and there are some of you who are relegated to the most abject time of life, its most despicable [state] of decrepitude and senility, so that after [having had] some knowledge, he no longer knows anything -- \u0060Ikrima said, \u0060Whoever recites the Qur\u0027n, such a state will not befall him\u0027. And you see the earth torpid, barren, yet when We send down water upon it, it stirs, it moves, and swells, it rises and grows, and grows [plants of] (anbatat min, min is extra) every delightful, fair, kind, species.",
  "That, which is mentioned, from the commencement of man\u0027s creation to the end of [the description of] the earth being revived, is because God, He is the Truth, the Constant, the Permanent, and because He revives the dead and has power over all things;",

For him there will be ignominy, chastisement, in this world -- thus he [Ab Jahl] was slain on the day of Badr -- and on the Day of Resurrection We shall make him taste the chastisement of the burning, that is, [the chastisement of] being burnt in the Fire, and it shall be said to him:",
  "\u0060That is [the chastisement] for what your hands have sent ahead, in other words, what you have offered [in the way of deeds] -- He refers to him with reference to the two [hands] as opposed to other [parts], because most actions are effected through them -- and because God is not unjust to His servants\u0027, chastising them without [their having committed] any sin.",
  "And among mankind there are those who worship God on a knife-edge: that is, with uncertainty in his worship -- such [a person] has been likened the [knife-] edge of a mountain in his precariousness -- if good [fortune] befalls him, [so that he enjoys] health and security with respect to his own self and his property, he is reassured by it; but if an ordeal befalls him, a trial or ill-health with regard to himself or his property, he makes a turnabout, that is, he reverts to disbelief, losing both this world, when what he had hoped for in it has eluded him, and the Hereafter, by [his] disbelief. That is the manifest loss.",
  "He calls on, he worships, besides God, in the way of idols, that which could not hurt him, should he refrain from worshipping it, and that which could not profit him, if were to worship it. Such, a call, is extreme error, from the truth.",
  "He calls on him (the lm [of la-man] is extra) whose harm, when worshipped, is likelier than his benefit, even if he were to have any benefit, as he imagines [him to have]. Truly an evil patron, is he, that is, [an evil] helper, and an evil friend, [an evil] companion is he. After the mention of \u0060the doubter\u0027 and [his being in manifest] \u0060loss\u0027 [above, verse 11] there follows [the mention of] the believers and [their] reward, as follows:",
  "Truly God shall admit those who believe and perform righteous deeds, in the way of obligatory and supererogatory acts [of worship], into gardens underneath which rivers flow. Indeed God does whatever He desires, in the way of showing beneficence to those who obey Him and degrading those who disobey Him.",
  "Whoever supposes that God will not help him, namely, Muhammad (s) His Prophet, in this world and the Hereafter, let him extend a rope to the ceiling, [to] the roof of his house, fixing it there and [tying it] to his neck, and let him hang himself, that is, let him choke to death because of it, by severing his soul from [any existence on] the earth, as [reported] in the [various] Sahh compilations.

And for many the chastisement has become due, and these are the disbelievers, for they refuse to prostrate, [an action] which is contingent on belief. And he whom God abases, [he whom] He makes unprosperous, there is none to give him honour, [none] to make him fortunate. Indeed God does whatever He will, in the way of abasing or giving honour.",
  "These twain are two contenders, that is, the believers constitute one contending party, and the five [categories of] disbelievers constitute the other contending party (the term [khasm, \u0060contender\u0027] may be used to refer to one or many) who contend concerning their Lord, that is to say, concerning His religion.

For whoever ascribes partners to God, it is as though he had fallen from the heaven and been snatched away by [vulture] birds, that is, [as though] they had seized him swiftly, or [as though] the wind had blown him, dropped him, into a far-off place, so that there is no hope of his being saved.",

He, that is, God, named you Muslims before, that is, before [the revelation of] this Book, and in this, that is, [in] the Qur\u0027n, so that the Messenger might be a witness against you, on the Day of Resurrection, that he delivered the Message to you, and that you might be witnesses against mankind, that their messengers delivered the Message to them. So maintain prayer, observe it regularly, and pay the alms, and hold fast to God, trust in Him. He is your Patron, your Helper and the Guardian of your affairs. An excellent Patron, is He, and an excellent Helper, for you. Meccan: it consists of 118 or 119 verses, revealed after [srat] al-Anbiy\u0027.",
  "Indeed (qad is for confirmation) prosperous, victorious, are the believers,",
  "those who in their prayers are humble,",
  "and who shun vain talk, and other [nonsense],",
  "and who fulfil payment of alms,",
  "and who guard their private parts, against what is unlawful,",
  "except from their spouses, that is, to their spouses, and what [slaves] their right hands possess, that is, concubines, for then they are not blameworthy, in having sexual intercourse with them.",
  "But whoever seeks [anything] beyond that, [intercourse with] wives and concubines, such as masturbation: those, they are transgressors, who have overstepped [the bounds] into what is not lawful for them.",
  "And who are keepers of their trusts (may be read as plural, amntihim, \u0060their trusts\u0027, or singular, amnatihim, \u0060their trust\u0027) and covenants, [made] between them, or between them and God, such as [the observance of] prayer and so on.",
  "And who are watchful of their prayers (may be read as plural, salawtihim, \u0060their prayers\u0027, or singular, saltihim, \u0060their prayer\u0027) observing them at their appointed times.",
  "Those, they are the inheritors, and none other than them,",
  "who shall inherit Paradise (al-firdaws), the name of a garden, the highest of the gardens of Heaven -- wherein they will abide; herein is an allusion to the Return [in the Hereafter] and so it is fitting that the Beginning [of creation] should be mentioned next:",
  "And, by God, We certainly created man, Adam, from an extraction (min sullatin, derives from [the verbal expression] salaltu\u0027l-shay\u0027a mina\u0027l-shay\u0027, \u0060I drew one thing out of another\u0027, meaning, \u0060I extracted it therefrom\u0027) his [Adam\u0027s] substance being, of clay (min tnin is semantically connected to sullatin, \u0060an extraction\u0027).",
  "Then We made him, namely, man, the progeny of Adam, a drop, a sperm-drop, in a secure lodging, which is the womb.",
  "Then We transformed the drop [of semen] into a clot, congealed blood. Then We transformed the clot into a [little] lump of flesh (mudgha), a piece of flesh, about the size of what one would be able to chew (m yumdagh). Then We transformed the lump of flesh into bones. Then We clothed the bones with flesh (a variant reading in both instances [instead of the plurals \u0060izman and al-\u0060izma, \u0060the bones\u0027] is [singular] \u0060azman [and \u0060al-\u0060azma], \u0060the bone\u0027; and in all three instances above khalaqn, means \u0060We made it become\u0027 [as opposed to \u0060We created\u0027]). Then We produced him as [yet] another creature, by breathing into him [Our] Spirit. So blessed be God, the best of creators!, that is, [the best of] determiners (the specificier noun for ahsana, \u0060the best\u0027, has been omitted because it is obvious: khalqan, \u0060in terms of creation\u0027).",
  "Then indeed after that you die.",
  "Then on the Day of Resurrection you shall surely be raised, for reckoning and requital.",
  "And verily We created above you seven paths, that is, [seven] heavens (tar\u0027iq is the plural of tarqa [so called] because they are the paths used by the angels) and of creation, that lies beneath these [paths], We are never unmindful, lest these should fall upon them and destroy them. Nay, but We hold them back, as [stated] in the verse: And He holds back the heaven lest it should fall upon the earth [Q. 22:65].",
  "And We sent down water out of the heaven in measure, that suffices them, and We lodged it within the earth; and We are indeed able to take it away, so that they die of thirst together with their livestock.",
  "Then We produced for you therewith gardens of date palms and vines -- these being the most common fruits of the Arabs -- wherein is abundant fruit for you, and whereof you eat, in summer and winter.",
  "And, We produced, a tree that grows on Mount of Sinai (read Sn\u0027 or Sayn\u0027, indeclinable as it is a proper noun with the feminine ending denoting a location) that produces (read either as tunbitu from the fourth form [anbata], or as tanbutu from the trilateral form [nabata]) oil (bi\u0027l-duhni: in the case of the former [reading of tunbitu] the b\u0027 [bi-] here would be extra, whereas in the case of the second [reading of tanbutu], it would be [a preposition needed] for the transitive) -- and this [tree] is the olive tree, and seasoning for those who eat (wa-sibghin li\u0027l-kilna, a supplement to bi\u0027l-duhni, \u0060oil\u0027, [that is to say] it is [like] a dye that colours a morsel dipped in it) -- and this [seasoning] is the [olive] oil.",
  "And surely in the cattle, that is, [in] camels, cows and sheep, there is for you a lesson, an admonition for you to heed. We give you to drink (read nasqkum or nusqkum) of what is in their bellies, [of] milk, and you have many uses in them, such as [the extraction of] wool, fur and hairs and other [uses], and you eat of them.",
  "And on them, the camels, and on ships you are carried.",
  "And verily We sent Noah to his people, and he said, \u0060O my people, worship God, obey God and affirm His Oneness. You have no [other] god besides Him (ghayruhu is the subject of m, \u0060no\u0027; the preceding [min ilhin, \u0060god\u0027] is the predicate, the min being extra). Will you not then fear?\u0027 His punishment in worshipping [gods] other than Him?",
  "But the council of his people, who disbelieved, said, to their followers, \u0060This is just a human being like you who desires to gain superiority, to have the honour, over you, by acquiring followers, you being [his] followers. And had God willed, that none other than Him be worshipped, He would have sent down angels, with that [Message], and not [assigned] a human being [for it]. We never heard of such, an affirmation of God\u0027s Oneness as that which Noah summons [us], among our forefathers, [among] past communities.",
  "He, Noah, is just a man possessed by madness, a case of dementia. So bear with him for a while\u0027, until he dies.",
  "He, Noah, said, \u0060My Lord, help me, against them, because they deny me\u0027, because of their denial of me, by destroying them. God, exalted be He, says, responding to his supplication:",
  "So We revealed to him [saying], \u0060Build the Ark, the ship, under Our watch, under Our observation and protection, and [by] Our revelation, Our command. Then, when Our command comes, that they be destroyed, and the oven, of the baker, gushes, with water -- and this was Noah\u0027s sign -- bring into it, admit into the ship, of every kind [of animal] two mates, a male and a female, that is, [two] of every species thereof (ithnayn is an object; min, \u0060of\u0027, is semantically connected to usluk, \u0060bring into [it]\u0027). According to the story God, exalted be He, gathered all the beasts of prey and the birds and other [animals] for Noah. As he [Noah] pushed forth his hands into each species, his right hand would fall upon a male and the left upon a female, whereafter he would take them on board the ship (a variant reading [for min kuli, \u0060of every\u0027] is min kullin, \u0060of every [kind]\u0027, in which case zawjayni, \u0060[two] mates\u0027, becomes a direct object, with ithnayn, \u0060two\u0027, [being repeated] for emphasis thereof); together with your family -- his wife [?] and children -- except for those against whom the Word has already gone forth, that they be destroyed, namely, his wife and his son Canaan (Kan\u0060n), unlike Shem (Sm), Ham (Hm) and Japheth (Yfith) whom, together with their three wives, he carried on board. In srat Hd [the following is mentioned where Noah is told who he should carry in the ship]: \u0060... and those who believe.\u0027 And none believed with him except a few [Q. 11:40]. It is said that these were six men and their wives. Moreover it is said that all those who were on the ship numbered seventy eight, half of them were men and half were women. And do not plead with Me concerning those who have done wrong, those who have disbelieved, that I should refrain from destroying them. They shall indeed be drowned.",
  "And when you have settled, [when] you are balanced, in the Ark together with those with you, say, \u0022Praise be to God Who has delivered us from the wrongdoing folk\u0022, [from] the disbelievers and the destruction that came upon them.",
  "And say, upon disembarking from the ship: \u0022My Lord, cause me to land with a landing (read munzalan as the verbal noun as well as the noun of place [for \u0060landing\u0027]; or manzilan as [meaning] the site of the landing) blessed, being that landing or place, for You are the best of all who bring to land\u0022 \u0027, that which has been mentioned.",
  "Surely in that, mentioned matter of Noah, the ship and the destruction of the disbelievers, there are signs, indicators of God\u0027s power, exalted be He, and indeed (wa-in, in has been softened in place of the hardened form, its subject being the pronoun of the matter) We were putting to the test, [indeed We were] trying the people of Noah by sending him [as God\u0027s messenger] to them and [by] his admonitions [to them].",
  "Then, after them, We brought forth another generation, [another] people, namely, and these were [the people of] \u0060d.",
  "And We sent among them a messenger of their own, namely, Hd, saying, \u0060Worship God! You have no other god besides Him. Will you not then be wary?\u0027, of His punishment and become believers?",
  "The council of his people, who disbelieved and denied the encounter of the Hereafter, [they denied] that they will end up thereat, and whom We had given affluence, whom We had provided with comforts, in the life of this world, said: \u0060This is only a human being like you: he eats what you eat and drinks what you drink.",
  "And, by God, if you obey a human being like yourselves (this [clause] contains both an oath and a conditional; the response belongs to the former [the oath], which [at the same time] suffices in place of a response for the latter [the conditional]) you will surely then, that is, should you obey them, be losers, you will have been duped.",
  "Does he promise you that when you have died and become dust and bones, you shall be brought forth?

  "Far-fetched, far-fetched (hayht is a noun of action in the past tense, functioning as a verbal noun, meaning ba\u0060uda ba\u0060uda, \u0060far from it, far from it!\u0027) is what you are promised!, in the way of being brought forth from the graves (li-m: the lm is extra, for explication).",

  "He said, \u0060In a little while, of time (\u0060amm: the m is extra), they will become remorseful\u0027, about their disbelief and their denial.",
  "So the Cry, the Cry of chastisement and destruction, seized them rightfully, and they died, and We made them as husks (ghuth\u0027 is desiccated vegetation, in other words, We transformed them into similarly desiccated [worthless] things). So a far removal, from mercy, for the evildoing folk, the denying [folk].",

  "Then sent We Our messengers successively (read tatran or tatr: one following the other, with a long interval between every two). Whenever there came to a community (j\u0027a ummatan: read pronouncing both hamzas, or without pronouncing the second one between it and the ww [vowel]) its messenger they denied him; so We made them follow one another, to destruction, and We turned them into folktales. So away with a people who do not believe!",
  "Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a manifest warrant, a clear proof, namely, the hand, the staff and other signs,",
  "to Pharaoh and his council; but they disdained, to believing in them and in God, and they were a tyrannical folk, subjugating the Children of Israel through oppression.",
  "And they said, \u0060Shall we believe two humans like ourselves, while their people are servile to us?\u0027, obedient and submissive.",
  "So they denied them [both] and became of those who were destroyed.",

And We gave them refuge on a height (rabwa), a highland -- in this case [either] the Holy House [of Jerusalem], Damascus or Palestine, all of which are [alternative] opinions -- level (dht qarr), an flat [high-] land on which its inhabitants are able to settle (yastaqirru), and watered by springs, running water, over ground, which the eyes can see.",

  "Nay, but their hearts, that is, [the hearts of] the disbelievers, are in ignorance of this, Qur\u0027n, and they have other deeds which they will perpetrate besides, the ones mentioned, against the believers, and they will therefore be chastised for them.",
  "Indeed (hatt is for inceptiveness) when We seize their affluent ones, their wealthy and their leaders, with chastisement, [with] the sword, on the day of Badr, behold! they are supplicating loudly, clamouring [in supplication]. It is [then] said to them:",

Nay (bal is for transition), he has brought them the truth, namely, the Qur\u0027n that comprises [affirmations of] the Oneness [of God] and the Laws of Islam; but most of them are averse to the truth.",
  "And if the truth, namely, the Qur\u0027n, had followed their desires, and come to them with [mention of] what they fancied in the way of God having a partner and a child, may God be exalted above such [associations], indeed the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have been corrupted, they [the heavens and the earth] would have deviated from their observed order, because contradictions would ensue, as is usually the case, when there is more than one ruler.

At other [points] they are awake and [as is stated] in one verse: Some of them will turn to others, questioning each other [Q. 37:50].",
  "Then those whose scales are heavy, with good deeds, they are the successful, the winners;",

  "Our Lord, bring us out of it! Then, if we revert, to disobedience, we will indeed be evildoers\u0027.",
  "He will say, to them by the tongue of a Keeper [of Hell], whose proportion is twice the size of this world: \u0060Begone in it, away with you in the Fire, despicable [as you are], and do not speak to Me, about relieving you from the chastisement -- so that [all] their hope is extinguished.",
  "Indeed there was a party of My servants -- namely, the Emigrants -- who would say, \u0022Our Lord, we believe; therefore forgive us, and have mercy on us, for You are the best of the merciful\u0022.",
  "But then you took them as an object of ridicule (read sukhriyyan or sikhriyyan, a verbal noun meaning \u0060mockery\u0027). Among those [ridiculed] were Bill [al-Habash], Suhayb [al-Rm], \u0060Ammr [b. Ysir] and Salmn [al-Fris]; until they made you forget My remembrance, which you disregarded, as you were engaged in deriding them. Thus these [men] were the cause of the forgetting, which is why this [act] has been attributed to them, and you used to laugh at them.",
  "Indeed I have rewarded them this day, abiding bliss, for the endurance they showed, while you mocked them and caused them hurt. They are indeed the winners\u0027, of what they sought (read innahum as [indicating] a new sentence, or annahum as [indicating] a second direct object of the [verb] jazaytuhum, \u0060I have rewarded them\u0027).",
  "He, exalted be He, will say, to them by the tongue of a Keeper [of Hell] (a variant reading [for qla, \u0060He will say\u0027] has qul, \u0060say\u0027): \u0060How long did you tarry in the earth, in this world and in your graves, in years?\u0027 (\u0060adada sinna is a specification).",
  "They will say, \u0060We tarried a day, or part of a day -- they are uncertain thereof, deeming it shorter [than what it was] because of the gravity of the chastisement they are suffering. Yet ask those who keep count!\u0027, namely, [ask] the angels who number the deeds of [all] creatures.",
  "He, exalted, will say, to them, also by the tongue of Keeper [of Hell] (a variant reading [for qla, \u0060He will say\u0027] has qul, \u0060say\u0027): \u0060You tarried but a little, if only you knew, the length of time you tarried, [you would have realised that it is] trivial relative to how long you will tarry in the Fire.",

But [it was] so that We might enthral you with commands and prohibitions, where after you would be returned to Us for Us to requite [you] accordingly: And I did not create the jinn and mankind except that they may worship Me [Q. 51:56].",
  "So exalted be God, above aimless action and other such things that do not befit Him, the King, the Truth! There is no god except Him, the Lord of the Noble Throne (\u0060arsh), the throne (kurs), which is a seat [similar to a king\u0027s] that is exquisite.",
  "And he who calls on another god along with God has no proof thereof (l burhna lahu bihi, an [extra] explicative adjectival qualification that has no [other syntactical] signification), his reckoning, his requital, will indeed be with his Lord.

  "This is, a sra which We have revealed and prescribed (read faradnh, or [the intensive form] farradnh, on account of the large number of prescriptions contained in it) and wherein We have revealed manifest signs, [signs] containing clear indications, that perhaps you might remember (tadhakkarna: the second t\u0027 [of tatadhakkarna] has been assimilated with the dhl), that you might be admonished.",
  "As for the fornicatress and the fornicator, that is, of those not in wedlock -- because those [in wedlock] are stoned according to the Sunna (the al [in al-zniya, \u0060the fornicatress\u0027, and al-zn, \u0060the fornicator\u0027] according to some mentioned [opinions] is a relative [particle]; the clause [al-zniyatu wa\u0027l-zn] is a subject, and because of its similarity to a conditional, the f\u0027 has been inserted into the predicate, which is [the following, fa\u0027jlid]): strike each of them a hundred lashes, [a hundred] strikes (one says jaladahu to mean daraba jildahu, \u0060he struck him on the skin\u0027). According to the Sunna, in addition to this [punishment] there is also banishment for a whole year. The slave, however, receives half of the mentioned [punishment]. And do not let any pity for them overcome you in God\u0027s religion, that is to say, in [the fulfilment of] His rulings, by disregarding any part of their prescribed punishment, if you believe in God and the Last Day, namely, the Day of Resurrection: in this [statement] there is an incitement to [abide by] what was [mentioned] before the conditional [above] and it also constitutes the response to the latter, or [at least is] an indication of the response to it. And let their punishment, the flogging, be witnessed by a group of the believers -- some say [that this should be a group of] three; some say four, as in the number of witnesses testifying to an act of fornication.",
  "The fornicator shall not marry anyone but a fornicatress or an idolatress, and the fornicatress shall be married by none except a fornicator or an idolator, in other words, what is suitable for each of the two [for the purposes of marriage] is the above-mentioned; and that, namely, marrying of fornicators, is forbidden to believers, who are better [than those]. This was revealed when the poor among the Emigrants resolved to marry the wealthy whores of the idolaters, so that they [the women] would provide for them. Thus it is said that the prohibition applies specifically to them; but it is also said to apply in general; but it was abrogated by God\u0027s words: Marry off the spouseless among you [Q. 24:32].",
  "And those who accuse honourable women [in wedlock], who are chaste, of fornication, and then do not bring four witnesses, to testify as eyewitnesses to their fornication, strike them eighty lashes, that is, each one of them, and do not accept any testimony from them ever, in anything; and those, they are the immoral, for committing a grave sin (kabra);",
  "except those who repent thereafter and make amends, in their deeds, for God is indeed Forgiving, of their [unsubstantiated] accusations, Merciful, to them, in inspiring them to make repentance whereby their immorality is curbed and their testimony becomes [once again] acceptable -- some say, however, that it can never be accepted [thereafter], if the proviso is taken to refer to the last clause.",
  "And those who accuse their wives, of fornication, but have no witnesses, to [substantiate] this, except themselves -- which happened with some Companions -- then the testimony of one of them (fa-shahdatu ahadihim, the subject) shall be to testify [swearing] by God four times (araba\u0060a shahdtin, is in the accusative as a verbal noun) that he is indeed being truthful, in accusing his wife of committing fornication,",
  "and a fifth time that God\u0027s wrath shall be upon him if he were lying, in this (the predicate of the subject [fa- shahdatu ahadihim, \u0060then the testimony of one of them\u0027] is [the implicit] \u0060will spare him the prescribed [legal] punishment for [false] accusation\u0027).",

  "Truly those who initiated the slander, the worst calumny against \u0060\u0027isha -- mother of the believers, may God be pleased with her -- accusing her [of fornication], are a band from among yourselves, a group from among the believers. She said [that these were] Hassn b. Thbit, \u0060Abd Allh b. Ubayy, Mistah [b. Uththa], and Hamna bt. Jahsh. Do not suppose, O you believers other than the [mentioned] band, that it is bad for you; rather it is good for you, for God will reward you for it and reveal \u0060\u0027isha\u0027s innocence and [the innocence of] the one who [is supposed to have] committed it with her, namely, Safwn [b. al-Mu\u0060attal]. She [\u0060\u0027isha] related: \u0060I accompanied the Prophet (s) during a raid, and this was after the [requirement to wear the] veil had been revealed. When he was through with it [the raid], he headed back [to the campsite] and one night, having drawn close to Medina, he announced that all should march off [home]. So I walked a distance [away from the campsite] and relieved myself. But when I came back to the campsite, [I realised that] my necklace (\u0060iqd meaning qilda) had snapped. So I went back to look for it. In the meantime they had strapped my litter\u0027 -- in which one rides -- \u0060thinking that I was inside, for in those days women were slight and ate very small portions (\u0060ulqa). [Finally] I found my necklace, but when I went back to where I had been staying overnight, they had already departed. I sat in the place where I had camped; I assumed that the group would notice my absence and come back for me. But my eyes were overcome [by drowsiness] and I fell asleep. Safwn had pitched camp behind the army to rest for some of the night (\u0060arrasa), then set off while it was still night until he reached the site of the camp. He saw what looked like a person sleeping and recognised me when he [eventually] saw me, having seen me on numerous occasions before the [requirement of the] veil. I woke up to the sound of him saying, \u0060To God we belong and to Him we shall surely return\u0027 (inn li\u0027Llhi wa-inn ilayhi rji\u0060n), for he had recognised me. So I concealed my face with my gown (jilbb) -- in other words, I covered it up with my wrap (mul\u0027a). By God he did not so much as say a word to me, nor did I hear him say anything other than the words, \u0060To God we belong and to Him we shall surely return\u0027, as he brought his camel to its knees and pressed with his foot against its foreleg [for me to mount it]. I then mounted it and he set off leading me back on the camel until we reached the army which had stopped because of the extreme midday heat; some had died [searching] for me. The one who bore the greater share of it [the sinful accusation] was \u0060Abd Allh b. Ubayy b. Sall\u0027 ... her [\u0060\u0027isha\u0027s] words end here; this was reported by the two Shaykhs [al-Bukhr and Muslim]. God, exalted be He, says: Upon every man of them shall be the [onus of the] sin which he has earned, in this [affair], and as for him who bore the greater share thereof, that is, [him who] assumed most of [the responsibility for] it, having initiated it and made it public, namely, \u0060Abd Allah b. Ubayy: there will be an awful chastisement for him, namely, the Fire in the Hereafter.",
  "Why, when you [first] heard about it, did the believing men and women not think good of themselves, that is, [why did] some [not] think good of others, and say, \u0060This is a manifest calumny?\u0027, [this is] a patent lie? (there is a shift here in the address from the second to the third person), in other words, [why did] you [not] assume [good of them], O band [of believers] and say:",
  "Why did they, that is, this band [of accusers], not produce four witnesses to it?, who had witnessed it. And since they did not produce the witnesses, those, in God\u0027s sight, in His judgement, they are liars, in this [matter].",
  "And were it not for God\u0027s bounty to you and His mercy in the life of this world and the Hereafter there would have befallen you, for what you, O band [of accusers], engaged in, [for] what you indulged in, an awful chastisement, in the Hereafter;",

  "And why, when you heard it, did you not say, \u0060It is not for us to speak about this. Glory be to You! -- this [exclamation] here is meant to indicate amazement -- This is an awful calumny?\u0027, [an awful] lie?",
  "God admonishes you, He forbids you, lest you should ever repeat the like of it, if you are [in truth] believers, [then] you will be admonished by this.",

  "Truly those who love that indecency should be spread, by the tongue, concerning those who believe, by its being associated with them -- and the ones [meant] are the band -- theirs will be a painful chastisement in the life of this world, by way of the prescribed [legal] punishment for [false] accusation, and the Hereafter, by way of the Fire, as is God\u0027s due, and God knows, that such [indecency] does not apply in their case, and you, O band [of accusers], as regards the calumny of which you spoke, do not know, whether such [indecency] took place among them.",
  "And were it not for God\u0027s bounty to you, O band [of accusers] and His mercy and that God is Gentle, Merciful, to you, He would have surely hastened to [bring about] your punishment.",
  "O you who believe, do not follow in the steps of Satan, that is, his ways of making things seem attractive. For whoever follows in the steps of Satan, assuredly he, the one being followed, enjoins indecency, that is, [he enjoins] vile acts, and what is reprehensible, if followed, according to the Law. And were it not for God\u0027s bounty to you and His mercy not one of you, O band [of accusers], would ever have grown pure, after the calumny of which you spoke, that is to say, [not one of you] would have ever been reformed or purified from this sin by repenting of it. But God purifies whom He will, from sin, by accepting his repentance from him, and God is Hearer, of what you have said, Knower, of your intentions.",
  "And do not let those of you who possess bounty, the wealthy, and the affluent swear not to give to the near of kin and the poor and those who emigrate in the way of God -- this was revealed regarding Ab Bakr who swore to provide no more for Mistah, his maternal cousin, a destitute Emigrant who had fought at [the battle of] Badr, because of his involvement in the calumny, when thitherto he had provided for him. And [it was revealed also regarding] certain Companions who swore not to give voluntary alms to those who had participated in [spreading] the calumny in any way. Let them forgive and excuse, them in this matter. Do you not love that God should forgive you? And God is Forgiving, Merciful, to believers. Ab Bakr said: \u0060Indeed. I would love that God forgive me\u0027, and he restored [thereafter] to Mistah what he used to expend on him.",
  "Truly those who make accusations, of fornication, against honourably married, chaste, women who are unaware, of indecent acts -- since it would never occur to them to commit such [acts] -- who believe, in God and His Messenger, shall be cursed in this world and the Hereafter; and there will be an awful chastisement for them",
  "on the day (yawma is in the accusative because of the [implicit sense of] \u0060permanence\u0027 to which lahum, \u0060for them\u0027, is semantically connected) when their tongues and their hands and their feet shall testify against them (read [feminine person] tashhadu or [masculine person] yashhadu, \u0060testify\u0027) concerning what they used to do, in terms of speech and action -- this [day] is the Day of Resurrection.",
  "On that day God will pay them in full their just due, He will requite them with the requital they deserve, and they shall know that God is the Manifest Truth, since He will have realised for them that requital of His whereof they had been in doubt. Among such [people] is \u0060Abd Allh b. Ubayy. The \u0060honourable women\u0027 mentioned above are the Prophet\u0027s (s) wives, regarding whom no repentance has been mentioned [as being possible] in the case of their being falsely accused; those women regarding whom repentance has been mentioned, however, at the beginning of the sra [verses 4-5], in the case of their being falsely accused, are women other these [wives of the Prophet].",
  "Vile women, and [vile] words, are for vile men, and vile men for vile women, and the mentioned [vile words]. Good women, and as mentioned [good words], are for good men, and good men for good women, and the mentioned [good words], that is to say, what suits something vile is its like, and what suits something good is its like -- such, good men and women, the like of \u0060\u0027isha and Safwn, are absolved of what they say, [what] the corrupt men and women [say] about them. For them, for good men and women, will be forgiveness and a glorious provision, in Paradise. \u0060\u0027isha felt honoured by some of the things [mentioned] in this [verse], namely, that she was created \u0060a good woman\u0027 and was promised \u0060forgiveness and a glorious provision\u0027.",
  "O you who believe, do not enter houses other than your houses until you have [first] asked permission and greeted their occupants. So a person must say, \u0060Peace be upon you, may I enter?\u0027, as is stated in one hadth. That is better for you, than entering without permission, that perhaps you might remember (tadhakkarna: the second t\u0027 [of tatadhakkarna] has been assimilated with the dhl) the superiority of such [conduct] and so follow it.",
  "And if you do not find anyone in them, to give you permission, [still] do not enter them until permission has been given to you. And if it is said to you, when you are seeking permission, \u0060Go away,\u0027 then go away, for this, going away, is purer, that is, better, for you, than sitting [and waiting] at the doorstep. And God knows what you do, whether you enter with permission or without it, and He will requite you for it.",
  "You would not be at fault if you enter [without permission] uninhabited houses wherein is comfort, some benefit, for you, in the way of finding shelter and so on, as in the case of travellers inns and charitable hostels. And God knows what you disclose, [what] you do openly, and what you hide, what you do secretly when entering houses other than your own, be it for a righteous purpose or otherwise. It will be mentioned shortly that they should bid themselves peace when entering their own houses.",

That is purer, in other words, better, for them. Truly God is Aware of what they do, with their gazes and private parts, and He will requite them for it.",
  "And tell believing women to lower their gaze, away from what is not lawful for them to look at, and to guard their private parts, from what is not lawful for them to do with them, and not to display their adornment except for what is apparent, namely, the face and the hands, which may be seen by a stranger, when there is no danger of [either or both falling into] temptation -- this being one of two opinions. The second [of these] is that [even] this is forbidden because there is a presumption that these [parts] will cause temptation -- and this is the preferred opinion, if one must settle this topic [with a definitive opinion]; and let them draw their veils over their bosoms, that is, let them cover up their heads, necks and chests with veils, and not reveal their, hidden, adornment, namely, all that is other than the face and the hands, except to their husbands (bu\u0060l is the plural form of ba\u0060l, \u0060male spouse\u0027) or their fathers, or their husbands\u0027 fathers, or their sons, or their husbands\u0027 sons, or their brothers, or their brothers\u0027 sons, or their sisters\u0027 sons, or their women, or what their right hands own, all of whom are permitted to look thereat, except for the part from the navel down to the knees, which is unlawful for any other than their husbands to see; \u0060their women\u0027, however, excludes disbelieving women, for it is not permitted for Muslim women to reveal themselves to these; \u0060what their right hands own\u0027 comprises slaves; or such men who are dependant, on what food may be left over, not (ghayri, read as an adjective, or read ghayra as an exceptive) possessing any sexual desire, [not] those men who are in [sexual] need of women, so for example those whose male member cannot become erect; or children who are not yet aware of women\u0027s private parts, in [the context of] sexual intercourse, and so to these they may reveal themselves except for that part from the navel to the knees. And do not let them thump with their feet to make known their hidden ornaments, as in a rattling anklet [and the like]. And rally to God in repentance, O believers, [repenting] of the occasions on which you may have looked at what is forbidden [to look at] of such [parts] and otherwise, so that you might be prosperous, [so that you might] be saved from such [sinful acts] when your repentance thereof is accepted -- in this verse the prevalent address is to males over females.",
  "And marry off the spouseless among you (aym is the plural form of ayyim, namely, a spouseless female, whether she be a virgin or one previously married, or a spouseless male), this [stipulation] relates to free men and free women, and the righteous ones, the believers, among your male slaves and your female slaves (\u0060ibd is one plural form of \u0060abd). If they, the free men, are poor, God will enrich them, through marriage, out of His bounty. God is Embracing, of [the needs of] His creatures, Knowing, of them.",
  "And let those who cannot find the means to marry be continent, [those who do not have] the bridal money or the means for financial support needed for marriage, [let them restrain themselves] from fornication, until God enriches them, [until] He improves their means, out of His bounty, and they marry. And those who seek a written contract [of emancipation], from among those whom your right hand owns, of male slaves and female slaves, contract with them accordingly, if you know in them any good, such as trustworthiness and the ability to earn [income] in order to fulfil the amount stated in the written contract, which might be worded for example thus: \u0060I contract you for [the amount of] two thousand to be paid over a period of two months, at one thousand a month, and if you fulfill this, you are a free man\u0027, and the other would say, \u0060I accept\u0027; and give them -- this is a command for the [slaves\u0027] owners -- out of the wealth of God which He has given you, in the measure that will help them to fulfill their commitment to you (the action of t\u0027, \u0060giving\u0027, here suggests that some of the amount to which they have committed themselves should be waived). And do not compel your slave-girls, your handmaidens, to prostitution, fornication, when they desire to be chaste, to abstain therefrom (this \u0060desire\u0027 is the cause of the [act of] \u0060compulsion\u0027, so that the statement is not properly a conditional), that you may seek, through such compulsion, the transient things of the life of this world -- this was revealed regarding \u0060Abd Allh b. Ubayy, who used to force his slave-girls to earn money through fornication. And should anyone compel them, then surely God, after their compulsion, will be Forgiving, to these [slave-girls], Merciful, to them.",

This [admonition] is specifically for \u0060those who fear God\u0027 because they are the ones to benefit from such [an admonition].",
  "God is the Light of the heavens and the earth, in other words, He illumines both of them with the sun and the moon.

Light, by Him, upon light, by fire; the light of God is His guidance of the believer, light upon the light of faith. God guides to His Light, that is, [to] the religion of Islam, whom He will.

  "In houses (f buytin is semantically connected to yusabbihu, \u0060glorify\u0027, that will follow) [whose status] God has allowed to be raised, [houses He has allowed] to be venerated, and wherein His Name is remembered, through the affirmation of His Oneness, therein [they] make glorifications (read yusabbahu, \u0060glorifications are made\u0027, or yusabbihu, meaning \u0060[therein] pray\u0027) to Him in the mornings (al-ghuduww is a verbal noun, meaning al-ghadawt, \u0060the early mornings\u0027) and the evenings, the darkness, after sunset,",

They fear a day when hearts and eyes will be tossed about, in fear, the hearts [tossed about] between [the hope of] deliverance and [the fear of] destruction, and the eyes to the right and to the left [out of anxiety] -- this is the Day of Resurrection;",
  "so that God may reward them for the best of what they did, that is, [reward them] the reward for it (ahsana means husna), and give them more out of His bounty; and God provides whomever He will without [any] reckoning (one says [of someone] yunfiqu bi-ghayri hisbin, to mean that such [a person] is so generous that it is as though he does not [need to] reckon what he spends).",
  "And as for those who disbelieve, their works are like a mirage in a plain (q\u0060a is the plural of q\u0060, that is to say, fult, \u0060an open space\u0027). [A mirage is] a kind of radiation which one might observe therein at midday during extreme heat, resembling running water -- which the thirsty man supposes to be water until he comes to it and finds it to be nothing, like what he had supposed. Likewise is [the case of] the disbeliever who supposes that his deeds, such as some voluntary alms, will benefit him; but when he dies and comes before his Lord he will not find his deed, in other words, it will be of no benefit to him; and he finds God there, namely, in the place of his deeds, Who pays him his account in full, that is, He requites him for it in this world; and God is swift at reckoning, that is, at requiting.",
  "Or, [it is that] those who disbelieve, their evil deeds are, as the manifold darkness on a deep sea, covered by a billow, above which, that is, [above which] billow, there is [another] billow, above which, second billow, there are clouds, these being the, manifold [layers of] darkness, one on top of another, the darkness of the sea, the darkness of the first billow, the darkness of the second together with the darkness of the clouds. When he, an observer, holds out his hand, in such layers of darkness, he can scarcely see it, in other words, he would not [even] come close to seeing it. And he whom God has not granted any light has no light, that is to say, he whom God does not guide cannot be guided.",
  "Have you not seen that God is glorified by all who are in the heavens and the earth, prayer being one form of glorification, and the birds (tayr is the plural of t\u0027ir), between the heaven and the earth, spreading their wings? (sfftin is a circumstantial qualifier). Of each [one of them] He, God, verily knows its prayer and its glorification; and God knows what they do -- the statement is predominantly directed to rational beings.",
  "And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, the treasuries of rain, provision and vegetation, and with God is the journey\u0027s end, the [final] return.",
  "Have you not seen how God drives the clouds, moves them along gently, then composes them, joining some with others and making scattered pieces as one, then piles them up, some on top of others, whereat you see the rain issuing from the midst of them, [from specific] outlets in them? And He sends down from the heaven out of the mountains (min jiblin: min is extra) that are therein, in the heaven (fh substitutes [for mina\u0027l-sam\u0027i, \u0060from the heaven\u0027] with the repetition of a genitive preposition) hail, that is, [He sends down] some [hail], and smites with it whom He will and turns it away from whom He will. The brilliance of its lightning, its flashing, would almost take away the eyes, that look at it, in other words, [it would almost] snatching them away.",
  "God alternates the night and the day, that is, He brings one in place of the other. Surely in that, alternation, there is a lesson, an indication, for those who see, those possessing insight, [an indication] of God\u0027s power, exalted be He.",
  "And God has created every beast, that is, [every] animal, from fluid, [from] a sperm-drop. Among them are some that creep upon their bellies, such as snakes and reptiles, and among them are some that walk on two feet, such as human beings and birds, and among them are some that walk on four, such as [four-legged] beasts and cattle. God creates whatever He will. Truly God has power over all things.",

Then after that a party of them turn away, they are averse to it, and those, those who are averse, they are not believers, as [believers] should be, [believers] whose hearts agree with [the words of] their tongues.",
  "And when they are summoned to God and His Messenger, who conveys His words, that he may judge between them, behold, a party of them are averse, to come to him.",
  "But if right be on their side they would come to him willingly, hastening compliantly.",
  "Is there a sickness, disbelief, in their hearts? Or are they in doubt, are they uncertain of his prophethood, or do they fear that God and His Messenger will be unjust to them?, in judgement, in other words, that they will be wronged therein? No! Rather, those, they are the wrongdoers, for shunning him.",
  "All that the believers say, when they are summoned to God and His Messenger, that he may judge between them, is that they say, in other words, the saying that befits them is [to say]: \u0060We hear and we obey\u0027, by responding [to the summons]. And those, then, are the successful, the ones who will be saved.",
  "And he who obeys God and His Messenger, and fears God and fears Him (read yattaqh or yattaqhi), by being obedient to Him, those, they are the winners, of Paradise.",
  "And they swear by God solemn oaths that if you order them, to [participate in the] struggle, they will surely go forth. Say, to them: \u0060Do not swear! Acknowledged obedience, to the Prophet is better than the oaths to which you are not true. Surely God is Aware of what you do\u0027, when you say you will obey but act otherwise.",

And if you obey him, you will be [rightly] guided. And the Messenger\u0027s duty is only to convey [the Message] clearly\u0027.",
  "God has promised those of you who believe and perform righteous deeds that He will surely make them successors in the earth, in place of the disbelievers, just as He made those, Children of Israel, who were before them successors, in place of the [ruling] tyrants ([the verb may be] read as active istakhlafa, \u0060He made [them] successors\u0027, or as passive istukhlifa, \u0060were made successors\u0027) and He will surely establish for them their religion which He has approved for them, namely, [the religion of] Islam, by making it prevail over all religions and enrich them throughout the land, so that they become masters thereof, and that He will give them in exchange (read wa-la-yubdilannahum or wa-la-yubaddilannahum) after their fear, of disbelievers, security. And God fulfilled His promise to them in the way mentioned, and He praises them with His words: \u0060They worship Me, without associating anything with Me\u0027 (ya\u0060budnan l yushrikna b shay\u0027an is an [independent] new sentence, standing as a justification [for His promise]). And whoever is ungrateful after that, bestowal of grace, from among them, [whoever is ungrateful] for it, those, they are the immoral. The first to show ingratitude for that [grace of God] were the murderers of \u0060Uthmn [b. \u0060Affn], may God be pleased with him, and they began to kill one another [henceforth] after having been brothers.",
  "And establish prayer and pay the alms, and obey the Messenger, that perhaps you may find mercy, that is to say, [do so] hoping for mercy.",
  "And do not suppose (read tahsabanna or yahsabanna, the subject of the verb being the Messenger) that those who disbelieve can escape, Us, in the land, by eluding us. For their abode will be, their return will be [to], the Fire, and it is surely an evil destination, it is an [evil] place of return.",
  "O you who believe, let those whom your right hands own, of male slaves and female slaves, and those of you who have not reached puberty, from among the free men, and who have not become [sexually] aware of women, ask leave of you three times: at three times [of the day]: before the dawn prayer, and when you put off your garments at noon, and after the night prayer. [These are] three periods of privacy for you (read thalthu [\u0060awrtin lakum] with nominative inflection as the predicate of an implied subject followed by a genitive annexation, with the annexed term standing in place thereof [of the predicate], in other words [the implied predicate followed by the annexation is] hiya awqt, \u0060these are times of ...\u0027; or read thaltha [\u0060awrtin lakum] in the accusative, the implication being that awqta is itself in the accusative as a substitute for the [syntactical] status of what precedes it, in place of which stands the annexed term). It is because clothes are taken off that private parts are revealed during such [periods]. Neither you nor they, namely, slaves and young boys, would be at fault, in entering upon you without asking leave, at other times, that is, after the three times of day [specified]; they frequent you, to provide service, [as] some of you [do] with others (this sentence corroborates the preceding one). So, just as He has clarified what has been mentioned, God clarifies for you the signs, the rulings; and God is Knower, of the affairs of His creatures, Wise, in what He has ordained for them. It is said that the \u0060permission\u0027 verse (yat al-isti\u0027idhn) was abrogated; but it is also said that it was not [abrogated], but that people thought little of neglecting to seek permission [in such situations].",
  "And when the children among you, O free men, reach puberty, let them seek permission, at all times, just as those, [now] older free men, sought permission before them. So God clarifies His signs for you, and God is Knower, Wise.",
  "And as for menopausal women, who have ceased to menstruate or to bear children because of old age, who do not expect to marry, for that reason, they would not be at fault if they put off their clothes, such a robe, a cloak, or the facial mask over a head veil, in such a way as not to display adornment, that is hidden, such as a necklace, a bracelet or an anklet; but to refrain [from doing so], by not putting them off, is better for them; and God is Hearer, of what you say, Knower, of what is in your hearts.",
  "There is no blame upon the blind, nor any blame upon the lame, nor any blame upon the sick, that they be one\u0027s table companions, nor, any blame, upon yourselves if you eat from your own houses, that is, [from] the houses of your offspring, or your fathers\u0027 houses, or your mothers\u0027 houses, or your brothers\u0027 houses, or your sisters\u0027 houses, or the houses of your paternal uncles or the houses of your paternal aunts, or the houses of your maternal uncles or the houses of your maternal aunts, or [from] that whereof you hold the keys, [from] that which you safeguard on behalf of others, or [from] those of your [faithful] friends (sadq is [so called] because he is \u0060faithful\u0027 (sadaqa) to you in his affection). In other words: one is permitted to eat from the houses of those mentioned, even if they are not present, provided that they consent to it. You would not be at fault whether you eat together, in a group, or separately, individually (ashtt is the plural of shatt). This was revealed concerning those who felt inhibited about eating alone and [who] when they could not find a table companion they would refrain from eating. But when you enter houses, that are yours, [houses] wherein there is no one, bid peace to yourselves, say, \u0060Peace be upon us and upon God\u0027s righteous servants\u0027, for the angels will return your greeting; and if there is family therein bid peace to them, with a salutation (tahiyyatan is the verbal noun from hayy, \u0060he saluted\u0027) from God, blessed and good, and for which one is rewarded. So God clarifies the signs for you, that is to say, He sets out for you in detail the [ritual] ceremonies of your religion, that perhaps you might comprehend, in order for you to understand this.",
  "Only they are believers who believe in God and His Messenger and who, when they are with him, namely, the Messenger, in a collective affair, such as [during] the Friday sermon, do not leave, when they have an excuse, until they have asked leave of him. Truly those who ask leave of you -- it is they who believe in God and His Messenger. So when they ask leave of you for some affair, [some] matter, of theirs, give permission to whom you will of them, to leave, and ask God to forgive them. Truly God is Forgiving, Merciful.",
  "Do not, among yourselves, consider the calling of the Messenger to be like your calling of one another, by saying, \u0060O Muhammad!\u0027 (s), but say, \u0060O Prophet of God\u0027, or, \u0060O Messenger of God!\u0027 gently, respectfully and in a low voice. Verily God knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously, that is, those who leave the mosque secretly during the sermon without asking leave, hiding behind something (qad, \u0060verily\u0027, is for confirmation). So let those who contravene His command, that is, God\u0027s command, or that of His Messenger, beware lest an ordeal, a trial, befall them, or there befall them a painful chastisement, in the Hereafter.",
  "Lo! surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, by way of possession, creation and servitude. He is ever aware of how you, O you who are obligated to [the prescriptions of] the Law, are behaving, with regard to faith or hypocrisy, and, He knows, the day when they shall be returned to Him (there is a shift here from the second person address [to that of the third person]), in other words, [He knows] when this [day] will be -- He will inform them, thereupon, of what they did, of good and evil, and God is Knower of all things, which they do and otherwise.

  "Blessed, exalted, is He Who revealed the Criterion (al-furqn), the Qur\u0027n -- called thus [al-furqn] because it has discriminated (faraqa) between truth and falsehood -- to His servant, Muhammad (s), that he may be to all the worlds, [to] mankind and the jinn, but not the angels, a warner, a threatening of God\u0027s chastisement.",
  "He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and Who has not taken a son, nor has He any partner in sovereignty; and He created everything, which was meant to be created, and then determined it in a precise measure, He fashioned it in a balanced form.",
  "Yet they, the disbelievers, have taken besides Him, that is, [besides] God, in other words, other than Him, gods, from among the idols, who create nothing but have themselves been created, and who possess no harm for themselves, that is, [the power] to repel it, nor any benefit, that is, [the power] to attract it, nor do they possess [any power over] death or life, that is, [nor do they have the power] to make a person die or to give him life, or resurrection, that is, [nor do they have power] to raise the dead.",
  "And those who disbelieve say, \u0060This, Qur\u0027n, is nothing but a calumny, a lie, that he, Muhammad (s), has invented, and other folk have helped him with it\u0027, who [according to the disbelievers] were from among the People of the Scripture. God, exalted be He, says: Verily thus they have committed wrong and [spoken] falsehood, [they have come with] disbelief and mendacity.",
  "And they say, that it [the Qur\u0027n] is also, \u0060Fables, their lies (astir is the plural of ustra) of the ancients which he has had written down, that he has had someone from among those people copy it down for him, so that they are read to him, for him to memorise, morning and evening\u0027. God, exalted be He, responds to them saying:",
  "Say: \u0060It has been revealed by Him Who knows the secret, the Unseen, of the heavens and the earth. Truly He is ever Forgiving, of believers, Merciful\u0027, to them.",
  "And they also say, \u0060What is it with this Messenger that he eats food and walks about in the marketplaces? Why has an angel not been sent down to him so as to be a warner along with him?, and confirm his truthfulness.",
  "Or a treasure thrown down to him, from the heaven, for him to spend from so as not to be in need of walking through the marketplaces in order to earn his livelihood. Or he has a garden, an orchard, for him to eat from?\u0027, that is, [to eat] from its fruits and satisfy himself therewith (a variant reading [for ya\u0027kulu, \u0060for him to eat\u0027] has na\u0027kulu, \u0060for us to eat\u0027) and thus possess because of that [garden] an advantage over us. The wrongdoers, namely, the disbelievers, say, to the believers: \u0060You are just following a man bewitched!\u0027, one duped, his mind overcome. God, exalted be He, says:",
  "See how they strike similitudes for you, of [the fact that the Prophet is] a person bewitched and one in need of something to expend [from] and of an angel to help him carry out the task [of delivering the Message], so that they go astray, thereby from guidance, and are unable to find a way, a means thereto [to guidance].",
  "Blessed is He, abundant is the good of God, Who, if He will, will give you better than that, treasure or orchard which they mentioned -- gardens underneath which rivers flow, in this world, for He has already willed to give him such things in the Hereafter, and will give (read apocopated form wa-yaj\u0060al) you palaces, as well (a variant reading [of the apocopated yaj\u0060al] is yaj\u0060alu, \u0060He will give\u0027, beginning a new sentence).",
  "Nay, but they deny the [coming of the] Hour, the Resurrection, and We have prepared for those who deny the Hour a blaze (sa\u0060r), a fire that has been set ablaze (musa\u0060\u0060ara), in other words, an intense [fire].",
  "When it sees them from a distant place, they will hear it raging, boiling like an enraged person when his heart boils with anger, and roaring, [producing] a powerful noise. Alternatively, what is meant by their \u0060hearing it raging\u0027 is their vision of it and awareness of it.",

But You gave them and their fathers, before them, ease [of living], by granting [them] long life and abundant provision, until they forgot the Remembrance, [until] they became remiss about admonitions and belief in the Qur\u0027n, and became a lost folk\u0027, [a folk] destroyed. God, exalted be He, says:",

  "And We did not send before you any messengers but that they ate food and walked in the marketplaces, and so you are like them in this respect, and truly what was said to them is being said to you. And We have made some of you a trial for others:, a test, trying the rich with the poor, the healthy with the sick, the honourable with the vulgar, in each case the latter would say, \u0060Why can I not be like the other person?\u0027 Will you be steadfast?, [and endure] what you hear from those with whom you are tried?

  "Verily he has led me astray from the Remembrance, namely, the Qur\u0027n, after it had come to me, by causing me to recant my belief in it. God, exalted be He, says: And Satan is ever a deserter of, the disbelieving, man\u0027, abandoning him and dissociating from him in [times of] tribulation.",
  "And the Messenger, Muhammad (s), says, \u0060O my Lord, lo! my people, the [tribe of] Quraysh, consider this Qur\u0027n as something to be shunned\u0027, to be disregarded.",
  "God, exalted be He, says: So, just as We have appointed for you enemies from among the idolaters of your people, We have appointed to every prophet, before you, an enemy from among the guilty, the idolaters -- so be steadfast as they were; but your Lord suffices as a Guide, for you, and a Helper, to bring you victory over your enemies.",
  "And those who disbelieve say, \u0060Why has the Qur\u0027n not been revealed to him all at once?\u0027, as the Torah, the Gospel and the Book of Psalms [were]. God, exalted be He, says: We have revealed it, thus, in parts, [it is], that We may strengthen your inner-heart with it, and We have arranged it in a specific order, that is to say, We produce it in stages one part after another, gradually and deliberately, in order to facilitate its comprehension and its memorisation.",
  "And they do not bring you any similitude, to invalidate your mission, but that We bring you the truth, that refutes it, and [what is] better [as] exposition, explanation.",
  "They are, those who will be gathered on their faces, that is, [those who] will be driven [as cattle], toward Hell: they will be in the worst place, namely, Hell, and furthest astray from the way, [they will be] on a path of error worse than that of others; and this [path] is their disbelief.",
  "And verily We gave Moses the Scripture, the Torah, and made Aaron, his brother, [go] with him as a minister, an assistant.",
  "Then We said, \u0060Go both of you to the people who have denied Our signs\u0027, that is, to the Egyptians -- Pharaoh and his folk. So they went to them with the Message but they [the Egyptians] denied both of them. Then We destroyed them utterly.",
  "And, mention, the people of Noah, when they denied the messengers, in denying Noah -- it is as though he were many messengers given the length of time he remained among them; or [it is thus expressed in the plural] because to deny him is [equivalent] to denying all the other messengers, for they all came with the same [Message concerning] affirmation of God\u0027s Oneness -- We drowned them (this is the response to lamm, \u0060when\u0027) and made them a sign, a lesson, for mankind, thereafter, and We have prepared, in the Hereafter, for the evildoers, the disbelievers, a painful chastisement, in addition to what [chastisement] may befall them in this world.",
  "And, mention, \u0060d, the people of Hd, and Thamd, the people of Slih, and the dwellers at al-Rass (al-rass) -- the name of a \u0060well\u0027; their prophet is said to have been Shu\u0060ayb; although some say it was someone else. [The story is that] they had been sitting around it [on one occasion] when it collapsed beneath them [burying them] together with their dwellings. And many generations, peoples, in between, that is, between [the people of] \u0060d and the dwellers at al-Rass.",
  "For each [of them] We struck similitudes, when establishing arguments against them, and We destroyed them only after warning [them], and each [of them] We ruined utterly, We destroyed utterly, because of their denial of the prophets sent to them.",
  "And verily they, namely, the disbelievers of Mecca, will have passed by the town on which an evil shower was rained (al-saw\u0027, \u0060evil\u0027, is the verbal noun from s\u0027a, \u0060was evil\u0027), that is, [it was showered] with stones. This was the principal town of the towns inhabited by the people of Lot; God destroyed its inhabitants for their committing acts of lewdness. Can it be that they have not seen it?, on their journeys to Syria, and so take heed thereof? (the interrogative is affirmative). Nay, but it is that they do not expect, they have [no] fear of [any], resurrection, and so they do not believe.",
  "And when they see you, they take you in mockery only, as an object of derision, saying, \u0060Is this the one whom God has sent as a messenger?, as he is wont to claim? -- contemptuously of him as one not worthy of being a messenger.",
  "Indeed (in, softened in place of the hardened form, with its subject omitted, namely, innahu) he was about to lead us astray, turn us away, from our gods, had we not stood by them\u0027, he would have turned us away from them. God, exalted be He, says: And soon they will know, when they behold the chastisement, with their own eyes in the Hereafter, who is further astray from the way, who is further upon the path of error: they or the believers?",
  "Have you seen -- inform Me [about] -- him who has taken as his god his own desire?, that is, as something that will be bring about his ruin (the indirect object [ilhahu, \u0060as his god\u0027] precedes the direct object because it is more important; the clause [beginning] man ittakhadha, \u0060him who has taken\u0027, constitutes the first direct object of a-ra\u0027ayta, \u0060have you seen\u0027, the second being [the following, a-fa-anta ...]) Will you be a guardian over him?, a protector to preserve him from following his desires? No.",
  "Or do you suppose that most of them listen, listening so as to understand, or comprehend?, what you say to them? They are but as the cattle -- nay, but they are further astray from the way, further from these [cattle] upon the path of misguidance, for at least they [cattle] yield to the person who looks after them, whereas these [disbelievers] do not obey their Master, Who is gracious to them.",
  "Have you not seen, contemplated, the work of, your Lord, how He extends the [twilight] shadow?, from the point of daybreak to the point of sunrise. For had He, your Lord, willed, He would have made it still, ever- present so that it does not disappear with the rising of the sun. Then We made the sun an indicator of it, [of] the shadow; were it not for the sun the shadow would not have been known.",
  "Then We retract it, the extended shadow, to Us by gentle retraction, subtle [retraction], through the rising of the sun.",
  "And He it is Who made for you the night as a garment, veiling [you] like a garment, and sleep for repose, rest for bodies through the [temporary] cessation of labour, and He made the day for rising, [a time] in which all rise to seek their livelihood and so on.",

  "with which We revive a dead land (read maytan, in the softened form, equally valid for the masculine and the feminine, but in the masculine [here] because of the [masculine] noun indicating \u0060place\u0027 [implicit therein]) and We give it, the water, as drink to the many cattle, camels, cows and sheep, and humans We have created (ansiyy is the plural of insn: properly it [the plural] should be ansn but the [final] nn has been replaced with a y\u0027, with which the [other] y\u0027 has been assimilated; or it [ansiyy] is [simply] the plural of insiyy).",

  "And had We willed, We could have sent forth in every town a warner, to threaten its inhabitants [with God\u0027s chastisement]; instead We have sent you to the inhabitants of all towns as a warner for your reward to be a great one.",

  "And He it is Who merged the two seas: letting them [flow] one adjacent to the other: this one palatable, sweet, and the other saltish, bitter; and He set between the two an isthmus, so that the one does not mix with the other, and a forbidding ban, a shield that prevents the two from becoming mixed.",
  "And He it is Who created man from water, [He created] from a sperm-drop a human being, and made for him ties of blood and ties of marriage, whether it be a male or a female, they marry for the purposes of procreation. For your Lord is ever Powerful, with the power to do whatever He will.",
  "And they, the disbelievers, worship besides God that which neither benefits them, when they worship it, nor harms them, should they refrain therefrom -- and these are idols; and the disbeliever is ever a partisan against his Lord, an assistant to Satan through his obedience to him.",
  "And We have not sent you except as a bearer of good tidings, of Paradise, and as a warner, a threatener [of people] with the [chastisement of the] Fire.",
  "Say: \u0060I do not ask of you in return for this, that is, for delivering that [Message] with which I have been sent, any reward, except that whoever wishes to follow a way to his Lord [should do so]\u0027, by expending his wealth for the sake of [attaining] God\u0027s pleasure, exalted be He; then [whoever wishes to do so] I will not prevent him from doing so.",

No! And it, this that is said to them, increases their aversion, to faith.",
  "God, exalted be He, says: Blessed, magnified, is He Who has placed in the heaven constellations, twelve [of them]: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo (al-sunbula), Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.

  "He, Moses, said, \u0060My Lord, I fear they will deny me,",
  "and that anguish will constrain my breast, because of their denial of me, and that my tongue will not utter clearly, to deliver the Message, because of the knot in it. So give the Mission to, my brother, Aaron, alongside me.",

  "He, Moses, said, \u0060I did that then, when I was astray, from the knowledge and the Message which God would later give me.",
  "So I fled from you, as I was afraid of you. Then my Lord gave me judgement, knowledge, and made me one of the messengers.",

  "Pharaoh said, to Moses, \u0060And what is \u0022the Lord of the Worlds\u0022 \u0027, the One Whose Messenger you say you indeed are? In other words: what exactly is He? And since there is no way for creation to know the true nature of God, but only to know Him through [an articulation of] His attributes, Moses, blessings and peace be upon him, responds to him with [mention of] some of these [attributes]:",
  "He said, \u0060The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, in other words, the Creator of [all] that -- should you have conviction\u0027, that He, exalted be He, is their Creator, then believe in Him alone.",
  "He, Pharaoh, said to those, noblemen among his folk, who were around him, \u0060Did you not hear?!\u0027, his response, how it does not correspond to the question [I asked]?",
  "He, Moses, said, \u0060Your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers\u0027. Now, even though this [fact] is comprised by what was [said] before it enrages Pharaoh, and therefore:",
  "He said, \u0060Verily this messenger of yours sent to you is a madman!\u0027",
  "He, Moses, said, \u0060The Lord of the east and the west and all that is between them -- should you comprehend,\u0027, that He is such [a Lord] then believe in Him alone.",
  "He, Pharaoh, said, to Moses: \u0060If you choose any god other than me, I will surely make you a prisoner!\u0027. His [Pharaoh\u0027s] prison was very harsh, for a person would be shut up [in a dungeon] underground alone, where he could neither see nor hear anyone else.",
  "He, Moses, said, to him: \u0060What, would you do this even, if I bring you something manifest?\u0027, patent proof of my Mission?",
  "He, Pharaoh, said, to him: \u0060Then bring it, if you are truthful\u0027, in this.",
  "So he threw down his staff, and lo! it was a manifest serpent, a great snake.",
  "Then he drew out his hand, he brought it out of his pocket, and lo! it was white, glowing, before the onlookers, and not its usual skin colour.",
  "He, Pharaoh, said to the council around him, \u0060Surely this man is a cunning sorcerer, an expert in the art of magic,",
  "who seeks to expel you from your land by his sorcery. So what do you advise?\u0027",
  "They said, \u0060Put him and his brother off for a while, postpone [judgement of] their affair, and send musterers into the cities",
  "to bring you every cunning sorcerer\u0027, to surpass Moses in the art of magic.",
  "So the sorcerers were assembled at a fixed time of a known day, which was the morning of the Festival Day.",
  "And it was said to the people, \u0060Will you assemble!\u0027",
  "Maybe we will follow the sorcerers, should they be the victors\u0027 (the interrogative [of the previous verse] is an incitement to assemble and the optative sense [implicit in la\u0060alla] is due to their anticipation of victory, and hence their continued adherence to their religion and rejection of Moses).",
  "So when the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh, \u0060Shall we indeed (read a-inna either by pronouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the second, but in both cases inserting an alif) have a reward if we were to be the victors?\u0027",
  "He said, \u0060Yes [of course]! And you shall then be among those closest [to me]\u0027.",
  "Moses said to them, after they had said to him, Either you cast, or we shall be the casters [Q. 7:115]: \u0060Cast what you have to cast\u0027 -- the command to do this signifies an authorisation for them to cast and a means whereby the truth will be made to prevail.",
  "So they cast their ropes and their staffs, and said, \u0060By the power of Pharaoh we shall surely be the victors!\u0027",
  "Thereat Moses cast his staff and lo! it was swallowing (talqafu: one of the original two t\u0027 letters [of taltaqifu] has been assimilated) what they had faked, [what they had] transformed through illusion, making their ropes and staffs appear to be moving serpents.",
  "So the sorcerers fell down prostrating.",
  "They said, \u0060We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,",
  "the Lord of Moses and Aaron\u0027, for they realised that what they had witnessed in the case of the staff could not have been the result of [mere] sorcery.",
  "Pharaoh said, \u0060Do you believe (a-mantum, read pronouncing both hamzas or replacing the second one with an alif) him, Moses, though I have not given you leave? He is indeed your chief, the one who has taught you sorcery -- so that he only taught you some [tricks] and then surpassed you with others. Soon you will know, what I will do with you! I will assuredly cut off your hands and legs on opposite sides -- in other words, the right hand of each one together with his left leg -- then I shall surely crucify you all.\u0027",
  "They said, \u0060There is no harm [in that], no damage will be done to us thereby. Surely to our Lord, after we die, whichever way that may be, we shall return, in the Hereafter.",
  "Indeed We hope our Lord will forgive us our iniquities, for being the first to believe\u0027, in our time.",
  "And We revealed to Moses, after many years which he spent among them calling them to the truth with God\u0027s signs but all of which only increased them in insolence, [saying], \u0060Journey with My servants, the Children of Israel, by night (a variant reading [for an asri] is an isr, from the verb sar, one form of asr) go with them by night in the direction of the sea, for indeed you will be pursued\u0027. Pharaoh and his armies will pursue you, but when they enter the sea in pursuit of you, I will deliver you and drown them.",
  "Then Pharaoh, having been informed of their night departure, sent to the cities -- it is said that he ruled a thousand cities and twelve thousand villages -- musterers, to assemble the army, saying:",
  "\u0060Lo! these are but a small gang. It is said that they [the Children of Israel] numbered 670,000, while his [Pharaoh\u0027s] vanguard alone numbered 700,000 and so he deemed their number insignificant in comparison to his huge army.",
  "And indeed they have enraged us, their actions infuriate us,",

  "So [it was], that is, Our expulsion [of them] was as We have described, and We made the Children of Israel to inherit these, after drowning Pharaoh and his folk.",
  "Then they pursued them, they caught them up, at sunrise.",
  "And when the two hosts sighted each other, the companions of Moses said, \u0060We have been caught!\u0027, Pharaoh\u0027s hosts have caught us up and we have no power against them.",

  "And there We brought near the others, Pharaoh and his folk, until they followed them across the same paths.",
  "And We delivered Moses and all those who were with him, by bringing them out of the sea while it was in the state mentioned [above].",
  "Then We drowned the others, Pharaoh and his folk by closing the sea on them after they had entered the sea and the Children of Israel had exited therefrom.",
  "Surely in that, drowning of Pharaoh and his folk, there is a sign, a lesson for those [generations] who would come after them; but most of them are not believers, in God.

  "When they came to the Valley of the Ants -- which is [located] either in T\u0027if or in Syria, and whose ants are either small or large -- an ant, the queen ant, who had seen Solomon\u0027s hosts, said, \u0060O ants, enter your dwellings, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you while they are unaware!\u0027 -- the ants are likened to rational beings in their use of the latter\u0027s speech.",
  "Whereat he, Solomon, smiled (fa-tabassama, the beginning [of the sentence]) amused (dhikan, the end [of the sentence]) at its words, which he had heard from three miles away and which was carried to him by the winds. When he was on the verge of [entering] their valley, he [Solomon] made his hosts halt until they [the ants] had entered their dwellings -- on this journey his hosts consisted of cavalry and infantry. And he said, \u0060My Lord, inspire me to be thankful for Your grace with which You have favoured me and my parents, and to do good that will please You, and include me, by Your mercy, among Your righteous servants\u0027, the prophets and saints.",
  "And he reviewed the birds, to see the hoopoe -- which would locate water beneath the ground and indicate its location by pecking at it, whereupon the devils would extract it, for Solomon required it for when he prayed; but he could not see him -- then he said, \u0060Why is it that I do not see the hoopoe?, in other words, is there something preventing me from seeing him? Or is he among the absent?, and so I cannot see him because he is absent?\u0027 And when he became certain [of the hoopoe\u0027s absence],",
  "He said, \u0060Assuredly I will chastise him with a severe chastisement, by having [all] his feathers as well as his tail plucked and leaving him out in the sun, where he would not be able to escape from reptiles, or I will slaughter him, by slitting his throat, unless he brings me (read la-ya\u0027tiyann or la-ya\u0027tinann) a clear warrant\u0027, plain manifest proof for his [having a valid] excuse.",
  "But he did not remain (read fa-makutha or fa-makatha) long [in absence], in other words, [he was away only] for a short while, and came to Solomon humbly, with his head up and his wings and tail lowered. Solomon pardoned him and asked him about what he had encountered during his absence: and he said, \u0060I have discovered something of which you have no knowledge, and I have brought you from Sheba (this may be read in declined form [min Saba\u0027in] or left as indeclinable [min Saba\u0027a]) -- a tribe in Yemen, whose name is taken from the name of one of their ancestors (which is also the reason why it may be declined) -- a verified report.",
  "I found a woman ruling over them, in other words, she was their queen, her name Bilqs; and she has been given [an abundance] of all things, that kings might require, in the way of machines and instruments, and she possesses a great throne -- its length was 80 cubits, its width 40 cubits, its height 30 cubits, and was made of gold and silver, encrusted with pearls, rubies, chrysolite, and emeralds, with its legs made of rubies, chrysolite and emeralds, containing seven [inner] doors, the door of each chamber shut.",
  "I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of God, and Satan has adorned for them their deeds and he has barred them from the Way, from the path of truth, so that they are not guided",
  "to prostrate themselves to God (all yasjud should be read as an yasjud: the l is extra and with it has been assimilated the nn of an, similar to [the construction] where God says, li-all ya\u0060lama ahlu\u0027l-kitbi, so that the People of the Scripture may know [Q. 57:29]; the sentence functions as the direct object of yahtadna, \u0060guided\u0027, whose il, \u0060to\u0027, has been omitted); [He] Who brings forth the hidden (al-khab\u0027 is a verbal noun, with the same meaning as al-makhb\u0027, \u0060that which is hidden\u0027) of rain and plants, in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what they conceal, within their hearts, and what they proclaim, with their tongues.",
  "God -- there is no god except Him, the Lord of the Mighty Throne\u0027 (this clause constitutes an [independent] new sentence, which is a eulogy comprising [praise of] the Throne of the Compassionate One to counter the [description of the] throne of Bilqs: between the two, however, is an unfathomable difference).",
  "He, Solomon, said, to the hoopoe: \u0060We shall see whether you have spoken the truth, in what you have informed us, or whether you are of the liars, that is, of their ilk -- for [to say] that is rhetorically more powerful than [simply] saying \u0060or whether you have lied\u0027. He [the hoopoe] indicated to them the place of the water and it was extracted. They thus drank, performed their ablutions and prayed. Solomon then composed a letter in the following form: \u0060From the servant of God, Solomon son of David, to Bilqs, Queen of Sheba. In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful: Peace be upon those who follow Guidance. To wit: do not rise up against me [in defiance], but come to me in submission\u0027. He then stamped it with musk and sealed it with his ring, and said to the hoopoe:",
  "Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them, that is, to Bilqs and her people, then turn away, withdraw, from them, but remain close by them, and see what [response] they shall return\u0027, [and see] what kind of response they shall give. Thus, he took it and approached her [Bilqs]. But as her soldiers were all around her, he cast it into her private chamber. When she saw it, she shuddered and was consumed by fear. She read what it said.",
  "Then, she said, to the noblemen of her people: \u0060O [members of the] council, lo! (read y ayyuh\u0027l-mala\u0027u inn, pronouncing [in the last two words] both hamzas; or by not pronouncing the second one and changing it into a ww with kasra vowelling) a noble, a sealed, letter has been delivered to me.",
  "It is from Solomon and lo! it is, in other words, its text says: \u0022In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.",
  "Do not rise up against me [in defiance], but come to me in submission\u0022\u0027.",
  "She said, \u0060O [members of the] council, give me an opinion (read y ayyuh\u0027l-mala\u0027u aftn, pronouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the second and changing it into a ww), in other words, guide me, in this matter of mine. I never decide on a matter, I never conclude it, until you are present\u0027.",
  "They said, \u0060We possess force and we possess great might, in other words, we are hardy in war. The matter is for you [to decide]. So see what you will command\u0027, us, and we will obey you.",
  "She said, \u0060Indeed kings, when they enter a town, ruin it, with destruction, and reduce the mightiest of its inhabitants to the most abased. That is what they too will do, namely, the senders of this letter.",
  "Now I will send them a gift and wait to see with what [response] the envoys return\u0027, in the way of accepting the gift or rejecting it. If it be a king [to whom we have sent it], he will accept it; but if it be a prophet, he will reject it. Thus, she sent male and female servants, one thousand in total, together with five hundred bricks of gold, a crown studded with jewels, and musk, ambergris and other things with an envoy carrying a letter. The hoopoe thus hurried back to bring the news to Solomon, who ordered bricks of gold and silver to be made and laid out across a [vast] square the distance of nine parasangs from his seat and for a towering wall of gold and silver to be constructed around it, and for the most splendid creatures of the land and the sea, together with the children of the jinn, to be brought to line the right and left sides of the square.",
  "But when he, the envoy, came to Solomon, with the gift and the servants, he said, \u0060Are you supplying me with wealth? What God has given me, of prophethood and kingship, is better than what He has given you, of [the things of] this world. Nay, but it is you [and not I] who exult in your gift, for you pride yourselves upon [the possession of] the ornaments of this world!",
  "Go back to them, with the gifts that you have brought, for We shall assuredly come to them with hosts which they will not be able to face and we shall expel them from there, from the land of Sheba (Saba\u0027) -- named [thus] after their tribal ancestor -- humiliated, and they shall be utterly abased\u0027, unless they come to me in submission. When the envoy returned to her with the gift, she had her throne placed inside seven doors inside her palace, with her palace inside seven palaces, and had all the doors locked with guards at them. She then prepared to make the journey to Solomon to see what he would command her. She departed with twelve thousand chieftains (qayl), each accompanied by thousands [of men] until when she came to within a parasang of him, he sensed her [arrival].",
  "He said, \u0060O [members of the] council, which of you (regarding the two hamzas read them in the way mentioned above [verse 32]) will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?\u0027, compliant and obedient? For I may only [rightfully] seize it before this [submission] and not afterwards.",
  "An afreet from among the jinn -- a [jinn who is] powerful and stalwart -- said, \u0060I will bring it to you before you rise from your place, the one in which you sit when adjudicating -- the period from morning to midday. Indeed I have the strength for it, that is, for carrying it, and I am trustworthy\u0027, over what it may contain of jewels and other [precious] things. Solomon said, \u0060I want something faster than that!\u0027",
  "The one who had knowledge of the, revealed, Scripture -- and this was [one] sif b. Barkhiy, a righteous individual with knowledge of God\u0027s Greatest Name, which when invoked [in supplication] for something it is [immediately] granted -- said: \u0060I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you, after you look at something. So he [the afreet] said to him, \u0060Look up towards the heaven\u0027, which he did, and when his glance returned [in front of him] he found it [Bilqs\u0027 throne] placed before him -- for in the instance in which Solomon looked up to the heaven, sif supplicated by invoking the Greatest Name that God bring it [thereto]; and this was done by having it travel under the earth until it sprung up below Solomon\u0027s seat (kurs). Then, when he saw it standing, still, before him, he said, \u0060This, bringing it to me, is of my Lord\u0027s bounty, that He may try me, test me, whether I give thanks (read a-ashkur, pronouncing both hamzas; or by replacing the second one with an alif; or by not pronouncing the second one, but inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without [the insertion]) or am ungrateful, for the favour. And whoever gives thanks, gives thanks only for his own sake, because the reward for his thanks shall be his, and whoever is ungrateful, for the favour, [should know] then my Lord is surely Independent, with no need of his thanks, Generous\u0027, by being bounteous to those who are ungrateful for it.",
  "He said, \u0060Disguise her throne for her -- in other words, transform it such that when she sees it, it will be in an unrecognisable form -- that we may see whether she will be guided, to recognising it, or be of those who cannot be guided\u0027, to recognise when things are transformed around them. He [Solomon] sought thereby to test her mind, for it was said to have something wrong with it. Thus they transformed it by adding or taking away [certain things] and in other ways.",
  "So when she came, it was said, to her: \u0060Is your throne like this?\u0027 She said, \u0060It as though it is the one\u0027. She had, in fact, recognised it; but she made a pretence to them just as they made a pretence to her, given that [when she was asked about the throne] it was not said, \u0060Is this your throne?\u0027, for had it been so, she would have replied, \u0060Yes, it is\u0027. When Solomon realised that she was perceptive and knowledgeable, he said: \u0060And we were given the knowledge before her and we had submitted [to God].",
  "And what she worshipped besides God, that is, other than Him, barred her, from the worship of God, for she belonged to disbelieving folk\u0027.",
  "It was, also, said to her, \u0060Enter the palace [hallway]\u0027 -- this was a transparent white glass floor underneath which flowed sweet water that contained fish. Solomon had it made when he was told that her legs and feet resembled the shanks of a mule. And when she saw it, she supposed it to be a pool, of water, and so she bared her legs, to wade through it. Meanwhile Solomon was seated on his throne at the front part of the palace [hallway], and he saw that her legs and feet were [in fact] fair. He said, to her: \u0060It is a hallway paved [smooth] with crystal\u0027, and thereafter he called her to submit [to God]. She said, \u0060My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, by worshipping other than You, and I submit with Solomon to God, the Lord of the Worlds\u0027. He wanted to marry her but disliked the hair on her legs. So the devils made a [depilatory] lime mixture (nra) and she removed it therewith. He married her and had [great] love for her. And he let her remain as ruler of her kingdom and would visit her once a month, staying for three days [every time]. Her reign came to an end at the same time as that of Solomon. It is reported that he became king at the age of 13 and died at the age of 53 -- Glory be to the One whose enduring sovereignty will never end!",
  "And verily We sent to Thamd their brother, in terms of [his belonging to the same] tribe, Slih, with the following [decree]: \u0060Worship God!\u0027, affirm His Oneness. And lo! they [then] became two parties quarrelling with one another, over religion, one party having become believers upon his arrival as messenger to them and the other party disbelievers.",
  "He said, to the deniers: \u0060O my people, why do you [seek to] hasten on evil before [seeking] good?, in other words, [why do you seek to hasten on] chastisement instead of mercy, when you say, \u0060If what you bring us is true, then bring us the chastisement!\u0027 Why do you not ask God to forgive you, [your] idolatry, so that you might be shown mercy?\u0027, and not be chastised.",
  "They said, \u0060We augur evil (ittayyarn is actually tatayyarn, but the t\u0027 has been assimilated with the t\u0027, and a conjunctive hamza added) of you and of those who are with you\u0027, namely, the believers -- when they [the tribe of Thamd] were deprived of rain and suffered hunger. He said, \u0060Your evil augury is with God -- He has given it to you; nay, but you are a people being tried\u0027, being tested with good and evil [turns of fortune].",
  "And there were in the city, the city of Thamd, a band of nine men, that is, [nine] men, who were causing corruption in the land, with acts of disobedience, which included their corroding of dinar and dirham coins [rendering them worthless], and did not reform [their ways], through obedience [to God].",
  "They said, that is, some said to others, \u0060Swear to one another by God that we will attack him by night (la- nubayyitannahu; or [read] la-tubayyitunnahu, \u0060that you will attack him by night\u0027) together with his folk, that is, those who believed in him, in other words, [swear] that we will kill them at night; then we will surely say (la-naqlanna; or [read] la-taqlunna, \u0060you surely will say\u0027) to his heir, the avenger of his blood, that we did not witness, we were not present at, the destruction of his folk (read muhlika or mahlika, meaning \u0060the destroying of them\u0027 or \u0060their death\u0027 [respectively]), and so we do not know who killed them, and [that] indeed we are being truthful\u0027.",
  "So they plotted, thereby, a plot, but We [also] plotted a plot, in other words, We requited them by hastening on their punishment, while they were not aware.",
  "So behold how was the consequence of their plot! For lo! We destroyed them and all their people, with Gabriel\u0027s cry, or by the angels\u0027 pelting them with stones, which they could see even though they could not see them [the angels].",
  "So those then are their houses [lying] deserted (khwiyatan is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier, the operator of which is the import of the demonstrative pronoun [tilka, \u0060those\u0027]) because of the evil which they did, that is, their disbelief. Surely in that there is a sign, a lesson, for a people who have knowledge, of Our power and are thus admonished.",
  "And We delivered those who believed, in Slih -- and they numbered 4,000 -- and were fearful, of idolatry.",
  "And Lot (Ltan is in the accusative because of an implied udhkur, \u0060mention\u0027, before it, and it [Ltan] is substituted by [the following, idh qla ...]), when he said to his people, \u0060What! Do you commit [such] abomination, namely, homosexual intercourse, while you watch?, that is to say, while you watch one another, [so] engrossed [are you] in the sinful act?",
  "What! Do you (read a-innakum, pronouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the second and inserting an alif between the two in both cases) come unto men in lust instead of women? Nay, but you are truly a people in ignorance\u0027, of the consequence of your action.",
  "But the only response of his people was that they said, \u0060Expel Lot\u0027s family from your town. They are indeed a folk who [prefer to] remain pure!\u0027, from [coming unto] the rears of men.",
  "So We delivered him and his family, except his wife -- We decreed [for] her, We made her by Our decree, to be of those who remained behind, in the chastisement.",
  "Then We rained on them a rain -- these were the stones of baked mud [cf. Q. 15:74] -- which destroyed them. And evil indeed was, their rain, the rain of those who were warned, against chastisement.",
  "Say, O Muhammad (s): \u0060Praise be to God, for the destruction of the disbelievers of past communities, and peace be on His servants whom He has chosen\u0027. Is God (read a-Allhu, pronouncing both hamzas; or by substituting an alif for the second one; or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without [such an insertion]) better, for those who worship Him, or the partners which they ascribe? (read [either] tushrikna, \u0060you ascribe\u0027, or yushrikna, \u0060they ascribe\u0027), [they being] the people of Mecca, [the partners they ascribe] to Him, in other words, are such gods better for those who worship them?",
  "Or He Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water from the heaven, whereby We cause to grow (there is a shift here from third person to that of the first person [plural]) splendid gardens (had\u0027iq is the plural of hadqa, which is an enclosed garden) whose trees you could never cause to grow?, because of you do not have the ability for it. Is there a god (a-ilhun, here and in the seven instances in which it occurs, read by pronouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the second, inserting an alif between the two in both cases) with God?, who has helped Him in [all of] this? In other words, there is no god with Him. Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals [to Him], who associate with God others.",
  "Or He Who made the earth an abode [of stability], that does not [constantly] shake beneath [the feet of] its inhabitants, and made rivers [to flow] throughout it and set firm mountains for it, with which He fixed the earth [in place], and set an isthmus between the two seas, between the sweet one and the salty one, the one not mixing with the other. Is there a god with God? Nay, but most of them have no knowledge, of His Oneness.",
  "Or He Who answers the desperate one, the anguished person suffering harm, when he calls to Him and Who removes [his] distress, from him and from others, and makes you successors in the earth (the annexation [khulaf\u0027a l-ardi, \u0060successors of the earth\u0027] has the same meaning as f, \u0060in\u0027 [khulaf\u0027a f\u0027l-ardi, \u0060successors in the earth\u0027]), in other words, each generation succeeding the one before it. Is there a god with God? Little do you remember, [little] are you admonished ([read] m tadhakkarna, \u0060do you remember\u0027; or [read] yadhdhakkarna, \u0060do they remember\u0027, where [in both cases] the t\u0027 has been assimilated with the dhl; the m is extra, [used] to make less what is already \u0060little\u0027).",
  "Or He Who guides you, shows you the way to your destinations, in the darkness of the land and the sea, by the stars at night, and by [the various] landmarks during the day, and Who sends forth the winds as harbingers of His mercy, ahead of the rain. Is there a god with God? Exalted be God [high] above what, others, they associate, with Him!",
  "Or He Who originates creation, in the wombs, from a sperm-drop, then brings it back again, after death, as established by the proofs for this [resurrection], even if you do not acknowledge it; and Who provides for you from the heaven, rain, and [from] the earth, vegetation. Is there a god with God? In other words, none of the things mentioned is done by anyone other than God, and there is no god with Him. Say, O Muhammad (s): \u0060Produce your proof, your definitive argument, if you are truthful\u0027, about their being a god with Me who has done any of the things mentioned.",
  "They [the disbelievers] also asked him when the Hour will come to pass, and the following was revealed: Say: \u0060No one in the heavens or the earth knows, be it angels or human beings, the Unseen, namely, what is hidden from them, except God, He knows it, and they are not aware, the disbelievers of Mecca, like others, when, is the time in which, they will be resurrected.",
  "Nay, has their knowledge come to comprise (read adraka, similar to the [4th verbal] form akrama, \u0060he was kind to\u0027; a variant reading has iddraka, which is actually tadraka, with the t\u0027 changed into a dl and assimilated with the [other] dl, and a conjunctive hamza added, meaning, \u0060attained\u0027 or \u0060caught up with\u0027) the Hereafter?, such that they [have reason to] ask about the time of its coming -- not so: Nay, for they are in doubt of it. Rather they are blind to it (\u0060amna, \u0060blind\u0027, as in blindness of the heart; this [statement] is rhetorically more powerful than the preceding one; the origin [of the term] is \u0060amiyn, but the damma vowel is deemed too heavy for the y\u0027 and has been moved to the mm, after dropping its kasra vowel).",
  "And the disbelievers say, also in rejecting the [idea of] resurrection: \u0060What! When we and our fathers are dust shall we indeed be brought forth [again]?, from the graves.",
  "Already we and our fathers have been promised this before. [But] these are just the [legendary] fables of the ancients\u0027 (astr is the plural of ustra, meaning \u0060what has been written down [m sutira] of lies\u0027).",
  "Say: \u0060Travel in the land and see how was the sequel for the criminals\u0027, because of their denials -- and this [sequel] is that they were destroyed with punishment.",
  "And do not grieve for them, and do not be distressed by their schemes -- this is meant to comfort the Prophet (s), in other words, do not be concerned with their plotting against you, for We will grant you victory over them.",
  "And they say, \u0060When will this promise, of chastisement, be, if you are truthful?\u0027, regarding it.",
  "Say: \u0060It may be that part of what you seek to hasten on is close behind you\u0027 -- so they were slain at Badr and the remaining chastisement will come to them after death.",
  "And surely your Lord is bountiful to mankind, an example of which is His deferring chastisement for the disbelievers, but most of them are not thankful -- disbelievers are not grateful for the deferring of chastisement since they reject [the fact] that it will ever come to pass.",
  "And surely your Lord knows what their hearts conceal, [what these] hide, and what they proclaim, by their tongues.",
  "And there is not a thing hidden in the heaven and the earth (the h\u0027 [t\u0027 marbta] of gh\u0027ibatun is hyperbole, in other words, anything that is completely hidden from people) but it is in a manifest Book, namely, [in] the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahfz) and in God\u0027s concealed knowledge, an example of which is the [time of the] chastising of the disbelievers.",
  "Truly this Qur\u0027n recounts to the Children of Israel -- those living at the time of our Prophet -- [the means to resolve] most of that concerning which they differ, that is, by virtue of the fact that it expounds the said [differences] as they should be, eliminating any disagreements between them, if only they were to implement it and submit [to its prescriptions].",
  "And truly it is a guidance, from error, and a mercy for believers, from chastisement.",
  "Surely your Lord will decide between them, as [He will] with others on the Day of Resurrection, of His judgement, that is, His justice. And He is the Mighty, the Victor, the Knower, of what He judges, so that none will be able to oppose Him in the way that the disbelievers have opposed His prophets in this world.",
  "So rely on God, trust in Him, for you are indeed upon the manifest truth, [upon] the manifest religion: the sequel shall be in your favour, with victory over the disbelievers. God then draws comparisons between them and the dead, the deaf and the blind, saying:",
  "Indeed you cannot make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call when (al-du\u0060\u0027a idh, read by pronouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the second one, eliding it with the y\u0027) they have turned their backs [upon you];",
  "nor can you lead the blind out of their error. You can only make those hear -- hear so as to comprehend and accept -- who believe in Our signs -- the Qur\u0027n -- and have therefore submitted, [are therefore] sincere in their affirmation of God\u0027s Oneness.",
  "And when the word [of judgement] falls upon them, [when] they deserve that chastisement befalls them as well as all [other] disbelievers, We shall bring forth for them a beast from the earth which shall speak to them [saying], that is, which shall speak in Arabic to those who are alive at the time when it appears, among its other statements, it will say to them on Our behalf: \u0060Indeed mankind (read tukallimuhum inna\u0027l- nsa; a variant has tukallimuhum bi-anna\u0027l-nsa, \u0060to tell them that mankind\u0027) had no faith in Our signs\u0027, in other words, they did not believe in the Qur\u0027n and what it comprises [of the mention] of resurrection, reckoning and requital. With its [the beast\u0027s] appearance the enjoining of decency and forbidding of indecency will cease, and thereafter no disbeliever will believe -- just as God revealed to Noah [when He said to him]: None of your people will believe except he who has already believed [Q. 11:36].",
  "And, mention, the day when We shall gather from every community a group of those who denied Our signs, namely, their leaders, the ones [whom they] followed, and they will be set in array, assembled, with the last of them brought together with the first and then led away,",
  "until, when they arrive, at the site of the Reckoning, He, exalted be He, shall say, to them: \u0060Did you deny, My prophets, by [denying], My signs without comprehending them, from the perspective of your denial, in knowledge, or what (amm: the interrogative m has been assimilated with am, \u0060or\u0027) was it (dh is a relative pronoun, in other words [it is in fact] m alladh) that you did?, with the commands given to you.",
  "And the word [of judgement] shall fall, the chastisement will be due, upon them because of the evil they committed, that is, [because of] what they associated [with God], and they will not speak, since they will have no [valid] argument.",
  "Do they not see that We made, We created, the night that they, like others, may rest in it, and the day for sight?, meaning, [for people] to see in it, so that they may go about their business therein. Surely in that there are signs, indications of His power, exalted be He, for a people who believe -- they [the believers] are singled out for mention because they benefit from such [signs] in their faith, in contrast to the disbelievers.",
  "And the day when the Trumpet will be blown, the Horn [will be blown], the First Blast, by [the archangel] Isrfl, and whoever is in the heavens and the earth will be terrified, that is, a fright that brings about death -- as is stated in another verse, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth will swoon [Q. 39:68] (the past tense [fazi\u0060a] is used to express the fact that such [events] will have occurred); except whom God will, namely, Gabriel, Michael, Isrfl and the Angel of Death. According to Ibn \u0060Abbs, however, these [excepted individuals] are the martyrs who are [described as], living with their Lord, provided for [by Him]\u0027 [Q. 3:169]. And all (kullun: the nunation compensates for the [missing] genitive annexation), in other words, and every one of them, after being brought back to life on the Day of Resurrection, will come to Him (read in the form of the verb [atawhu] or the active participle [thu]) in [utter] humility, humbled (the past tense, atawhu, is used to express the fact that this will have happened).",
  "And you see the mountains, you notice them, at the moment of the Blast, supposing them to be still, stationary in their place, because of their tremendous size, while they drift like passing clouds, [like the drifting of the] rain when it is blown around by the wind, in other words, they [the mountains] will be drifting in like manner until they [eventually] fall to the ground, whereby they are flattened before becoming like [tufts of] \u0060wool\u0027 [cf. Q. 101:5] and then \u0060scattered dust\u0027 [cf. Q. 56:6]. God\u0027s handiwork (sun\u0060a, a verbal noun emphasising the import of the preceding sentence, and which has been annexed [in a genitive construction] to its agent [Allhi, \u0060God\u0027] after the omission of its operator) Who has perfected everything, that He has made. Truly He is aware of what you do (taf\u0060alna; or [read] yaf\u0060alna, \u0060[what] they do\u0027), namely, His enemies, [what they do] in the way of disobedience, and His friends, in the way of obedience.",
  "Whoever brings a good deed, namely, [the profession of] \u0060there is no god but God\u0027, on the Day of Resurrection, shall have good, [shall have] a reward, for it, because of it (this [khayrun] is not the comparative [\u0060better\u0027], since there is no deed better [than a good deed]). In another verse [it is stated that] he shall have tenfold the like of it [Q. 6:160]; and they, namely, those who bring such [good deeds], shall be secure from the terror of that day (min faza\u0060i yawmi\u0027idhin, if read as a genitive annexation; or min faza\u0060in yawma\u0027idhin, \u0060from terror on that day\u0027).",
  "And whoever brings an evil deed, namely, the ascribing of partners [to God], their faces shall be thrust into the Fire, having been oriented towards it -- \u0060faces\u0027 are specifically mentioned here because of all the sensory organs it is where [a person\u0027s] dignity resides, and so other parts [of the body] are more deserving [of punishment]. It shall be said to them in reproach: \u0060Are you requited except, the requital, for what you used to do?\u0027, in the way of idolatry and acts of disobedience.",
  "Say to them: I have been commanded only to worship the Lord of this land, namely, Mecca, which He has made inviolable, which He has made a secure Sanctuary, one in which no human blood may be shed, no person may be wronged, none of its prey may be hunted and [a sanctuary] which is never deserted. Such were the graces bestowed [by God] upon its inhabitants, the [tribe of] Quraysh, [graces] whereby God has spared their land the suffering and civil strife common to all the [other] lands of the Arabs; and to Whom, exalted be He, all things belong, for He is their Lord, Creator and Possessor. And I have been commanded to be of those who submit, to God, by affirming His Oneness;",
  "and to recite the Qur\u0027n, to you as a call to faith. So whoever is guided, to it, is guided only for his own sake, since the reward for his being guided will be his; and whoever goes astray, from faith and errs from the path of guidance, say, to him: \u0060I am just one of the warners\u0027, the threateners, and therefore my duty is only to deliver [the Message] -- this was [revealed] before the command to fight [against the disbelievers].",
  "And say: \u0060Praise be to God. He will show you His signs and you will recognise them. Thus on the day of Badr God showed them how it was to be killed, to be taken prisoner and to be beaten by the angels on their faces and backs; and God hastened on for them the [punishment of the] Fire. And your Lord is not oblivious of what they do\u0027 (ya\u0060malna; or [read] ta\u0060malna, \u0060[what] you do\u0027) but grants them respite until their [appointed] time [of requital]. Meccan, except verses 52 to 55, which are Medinese, and verse 85, which was revealed at al-Juhfa during the Hijra; it consists of 88 verses, revealed after [srat] al-Naml.",
  "T sn mm: God knows best what He means by these [letters].",
  "Those, namely, these signs, are the signs of the Manifest Book (the genitive annexation conveys the [partitive] sense of min, \u0060of\u0027 [\u0060verses from the Manifest Book\u0027]), [the Manifest Book] which reveals truth from falsehood.",
  "We will recount, narrate, to you [something] of the tale of Moses and Pharaoh truthfully, for a people who believe, for their sake, since they are the ones to benefit from such [an account].",
  "Truly Pharaoh had exalted himself in the land, the land of Egypt, and reduced its people into sects, groups, to serve him, oppressing a group of them, namely, the Children of Israel, slaughtering their sons, the new- born, and sparing their women, keeping them alive -- for some of the [Egyptian] priests had told him, \u0060A new-born of the Children of Israel shall bring about the end of your kingdom\u0027. Indeed he was of those who cause corruption, through [the use of] slaughter and otherwise.",
  "And We desired to show favour to those who were oppressed in the land, and to make them exemplars (read a\u0027immatan, pronouncing both hamzas, or by replacing the second one with a y\u0027) whose good example would be followed, and to make them the inheritors, of Pharaoh\u0027s kingdom;",
  "and to establish them in the land, the land of Egypt and Syria, and to show Pharaoh and Hmn and their hosts (a variant reading has wa-yar Fir\u0060awnu wa-Hmnu wa-junduhum, \u0060so that Pharaoh and Hmn and their hosts might see\u0027, with all three [nouns] in the nominative) from them that of which they were apprehensive, [that which] they feared of the new-born [Israelite] who would bring about the end of their kingdom.",
  "And We revealed, by inspiration or in a dream, to the mother of Moses -- who was the said new-born; his sister was the only other person aware of his birth -- \u0060Suckle him, then, when you fear for him, cast him into the waters, namely, the Nile, and do not fear, that he should drown, or grieve, for being separated from him, for We will restore him to you and make him one of the messengers\u0027. She suckled him for three months during which he never cried. She then began to fear for him and so she placed him in a basket coated with pitch and made as a cradle for him on the inside. She then closed it and cast it into the waters of the Nile at night.",
  "Then Pharaoh\u0027s folk, aids, picked him up, with him [still] in the basket, the morning following that night -- it was placed him in front of him [Pharaoh] and then opened and Moses was brought out of it, sucking milk from his thumb -- to be, at the end of the affair, an enemy, slaying their menfolk, and a [cause of] grief to them, enslaving their womenfolk (a variant reading [for hazanan] is huznan, both of which are alternative forms of the verbal noun, and it functions as an active participle, derived from hazanahu, which is like ahzanahu, \u0060he caused him grief\u0027). Truly Pharaoh and, his minister, Hmn, and their hosts were sinners, that is, disobedient, and so they were punished at his [Moses\u0027s] hands.",
  "And Pharaoh\u0027s wife said, after he and his aids had resolved to slay him: he is, \u0060A joyous sight for me and you. Do not slay him. Perhaps he will be of benefit to us, or we will adopt him as a son\u0027, and so they obeyed her [wish]. And they were not aware, of the sequel to their affair with him.",
  "And the heart of Moses\u0027s mother, when she found out that they had picked him up, became empty, of everything other than him. Indeed (in, softened from the hardened form, its subject omitted, in other words [understand it as] innaha) she was about to expose him, that is, as being her son, had We not fortified her heart, with patience, that is, We made it at peace, that she might be of the believers, [of] those who have faith in God\u0027s promise (the response to [the conditional] lawl, \u0060had ... not\u0027, is given by the preceding [statement]).",
  "And she said to his sister, Mary, \u0060Follow him\u0027, in other words, follow where he goes in order to find out his news. So she watched him from afar, from a distance, secretly, while they were not aware, that she was his sister, or that she was [even] watching him.",
  "And We had forbidden him to [take to the breasts of] fostermothers from before, that is to say, we prevented him from taking to the breasts of any suckling mother other than his own mother. Therefore he would not accept the breasts of any of the foster-mothers brought for him. So she, his sister, said, \u0060Shall I show you a household -- having seen their affection for him -- who will take care of him for you, by having him suckled and so on, and who will act in good faith towards him?\u0027 (the [suffixed] pronoun in lahu has been interpreted as referring to the king, as a response to them [when they asked Mary how she could be sure]). Her suggestion was accepted. So she brought his mother and he took to her breast. She explained to them that he had taken to her [breast] because of her pleasant scent and the wholesome taste of her milk. Permission was given to her to breast-feed him in her own house and so she returned with him, just as God, exalted be He, says:",
  "Thus We restored him to his mother so that her eyes might delight, in seeing him [again], and not grieve, thereat, and that she might know that God\u0027s promise, to restore him to her, is true; but most of them, that is, the people, do not know, about this promise, or of the fact that this was his sister and the other was his mother. He [Moses] remained with her until he was weaned during which time she was paid wages at one dinar per day. She took this because it was money from enemy territory (harb). She then brought him [back] to Pharaoh in whose household he was raised, as God recounts of him in srat al-Shu\u0060ar\u0027 [Q. 26:18], Did we not rear you among us as a child, and did you not stay with us for years of your life?",
  "And when he came of age, namely, at 30 or 33, and [then] was [fully] mature, that is, when he reached the age of 40, We gave him judgement, wisdom, and knowledge, comprehension of religious matters before he was sent as a prophet. And so, just as We rewarded him, do We reward those are virtuous, to their own souls.",
  "And he, Moses, entered the city, Pharaoh\u0027s city, Memphis, having been absent from it for a while, at a time when its people were oblivious, the time of the afternoon nap, and found therein two men fighting, one of his own faction, namely, an Israelite, and the other of his enemies, in other words, an Egyptian, who was exploiting an Israelite to carry firewood to Pharaoh\u0027s kitchen. So the one who was of his faction called to him for help against the one who was of his enemies, and so Moses said to him, \u0060Leave him be!\u0027, and it is said that he replied to Moses [thus]: \u0060I am truly considering making you carry this [firewood]!\u0027. So Moses punched him, that is, he hit him with his fist clenched -- he [Moses] was a strong man with a powerful strike, and did away with him, that is, he killed him, but he had not intended to kill him. He buried him in the sand. He said, \u0060This, killing of him, is of Satan\u0027s doing, inciting my anger. Indeed he is an enemy, to the son of Adam, a manifest misleader\u0027, of him.",
  "He said, remorsefully, \u0060My Lord, I have indeed wronged myself, by killing him, so forgive me!\u0027 So He forgave him. Truly He is the Forgiving, the Merciful, that is to say, the One Who has always possessed, and will always possess, these two attributes.",
  "He said, \u0060My Lord, forasmuch as You have been gracious to me, with forgiveness, protect me [so], I will never be a partisan, a supporter, of the criminals\u0027, the disbelievers henceforth, if you were to protect me.",
  "In the morning he was in the city, fearful, vigilant, waiting to see what would happen to him [in reaction] from the side of the slain man; -- when behold, the one who had sought his help the day before cried out to him for help [again], asking for his help against another Egyptian. Moses said to him, \u0060Clearly you are a trouble-maker!\u0027, whose trouble-making is evident, judging by what you did yesterday and today.",
  "But when (fa-lamm an: an is extra) he was about to strike the man who was an enemy to both of them, to Moses and the one seeking his help, he, the one seeking help, supposing that Moses was about to strike him, because of what he [Moses] had said to him, said: \u0060O Moses, do you want to slay me just as you slew a soul yesterday? You merely want to be a tyrant in the land, and you do not want to be of the reformers\u0027. The Egyptian heard this and realised that the slayer had been Moses. Thus he hurried off to Pharaoh to inform him of this. Pharaoh then ordered slaughterers to slay Moses, and they set off in his direction.",
  "And a man, who was the [only] believer among Pharaoh\u0027s kinsfolk, came from the outskirts of the city, hastening, walking fast, via a route quicker than theirs. He said, \u0060O Moses, lo! the council, of Pharaoh\u0027s folk, are conspiring, discussing [the means], to slay you. So leave, the city. Truly I am speaking to you in good faith\u0027, in bidding you to leave.",
  "So he departed from it, fearful, vigilant, lest any of the pursuers catch up with him, or [in the hope] that God might rescue him. He said, \u0060My Lord, deliver me from the evildoing people\u0027, Pharaoh\u0027s people.",
  "And when he turned his face towards Midian, in the direction thereof -- and this [Midian] was the town of [the prophet] Shu\u0060ayb, eight day\u0027s journeying from Egypt, [so] named after Midian son of Abraham; he [Moses] did not know the route to it -- he said, \u0060Perhaps my Lord will show me the right way\u0027, that is to say, which route to follow, in other words, the simplest route to it. God thus sent forth to him an angel with a goat, which he [Moses] set off following towards it [the town].",
  "And when he arrived at the Water of Midian, [the name of] a well therein, he found a group of people there watering, their flocks, and he found, besides them, two women holding back their flock, from the water. He, Moses, said, to the two: \u0060What is your business?\u0027, that is, \u0060What is the matter with you, that you are not watering?\u0027 They said, \u0060We do not water [our flock] until the shepherds have moved on (ri\u0060\u0027u, \u0060shepherds\u0027, the plural of r\u0060in) that is to say, until they have returned from the watering, for fear of being crushed [by the throng], after which we go to water (a variant reading [for yasdiru, \u0060move on\u0027] is the 4th form [subjunctive] yusdira, \u0060to drive away\u0027, meaning, until they [the shepherds] have driven their flocks away from the water\u0027) and our father is a very old man\u0027, unable to [come and] water.",
  "So he watered [their flock] for them, from another well nearby, by lifting a rock from on top of it, which only ten men could have lifted; then he retreated to the shade, of an acacia tree (samura), because of the extreme heat of the sun and he was hungry, and said, \u0060My Lord, indeed I am in utter need of whatever good, [whatever] food, You send down to me\u0027. The two women returned to their father quicker than usual and so he asked them why [it was so]. They told him about the man who had watered [their flock] for them. So he said to one of them, \u0060Summon him to [come to] me\u0027.",
  "God, exalted be He, says: Then one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully -- in other words, covering her face with the sleeve of her shirt, being shy of him -- and said, \u0060My father invites you, that he may pay you a wage for watering [our flock] for us\u0027. He accepted her invitation, while inwardly he disapproved of accepting any wage, for it was as though she sought to remunerate him and as though he were of those who would want it [which he was not]. She walked in front of him but when the wind began to blow off her dress and reveal her legs, he said to her, \u0060Walk behind me and show me the way\u0027, which she did. Finally he came to her father, Shu\u0060ayb, peace be upon him, who was sitting with some supper in front of him. He said to him, \u0060Sit and have some supper\u0027. He [Moses] said, \u0060I hope that this is not [some sort of] compensation for having watered [their flock] for them? For we are People of a House and do not demand compensation for good deeds\u0027. He [Shu\u0060ayb] said, \u0060No. It is [simply] a custom of mine and of my forefathers to be hospitable to guests and to offer them food\u0027. Thus, he [Moses] ate and informed him of his predicament. God, exalted be He, says: So when he came to him and recounted to him the story (al-qasas is a verbal noun with the sense of al-maqss, \u0060that which is recounted\u0027), of his slaying of the Egyptian and their intention to slay him and his fear of Pharaoh, he [their father] said, \u0060Do not be afraid. You have escaped from the evildoing people\u0027, as Pharaoh had no authority over Midian.",
  "One of the two women, the one that had been sent [by her father], either the elder or the younger, said, \u0060O my father, hire him, employ him in return for a wage, that he may tend our flock instead of us. Surely the best [man] you can hire is the strong, the trustworthy man\u0027, in other words, hire him on account of his strength and trustworthiness. He [Shu\u0060ayb] asked her about him and she told him, as mentioned above, how he had lifted the rock off the well and that he had said to her, \u0060Walk behind me\u0027, in addition to his lowering his head when he realised that she was coming towards him, refusing to lift it [until she left]. He [Shu\u0060ayb] therefore was keen to have him marry [one of his daughters].",
  "He said, \u0060I desire to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine, either the elder or the younger one, on condition that you hire yourself to me, that you are employed by me to tend my flock, for eight years. And if you complete ten, that is, the tending of ten years, that, completion, shall be of your own accord. I do not want to be hard on you, by making it [the marriage] conditional on ten [years service]. God willing -- [expressed] to seek [God\u0027s] blessing -- you shall find me to be one of the righteous\u0027, of those who fulfil their covenants.",
  "He, Moses, said, \u0060That, which you have said, is [settled then] between me and you. Whichever of the two terms, the eight or the ten (the m [in ayyam, \u0060whichever of the two\u0027] is extra), in other words, the tending thereof, I complete, there shall be no injustice [done] to me, by demanding [of me] to do more [tending]. And God is Guardian, Keeper or Witness, over what we, you and I, say\u0027. The contract was agreed in this way. Shu\u0060ayb bid his daughter to give Moses a staff with which to beat off predatory beasts from his sheep -- the staffs of the prophets were in his keeping. It was Adam\u0027s staff, made from the myrtle of Paradise, that fell into her hands and so Moses took it, with Shu\u0060ayb\u0027s knowledge.",
  "So when Moses had completed the term, of his tending -- of eight years, or of ten years, which is what is generally assumed -- and was travelling with his family, his wife, with the permission of her father, in the direction of Egypt, he saw in the distance on the side of the Mount [Tr] a fire (al-Tr is the name of a mountain). He said to his family, \u0060Wait, here; I see a fire in the distance. Maybe I will bring you from it news, about [how to rejoin] the route [to Egypt] -- for he had strayed from it [along the way] -- or a brand (read with any of the three vowels [jadhwa, jidhwa, or judhwa], which [either] means \u0060a bundle\u0027, or \u0060a flame\u0027) from the fire, that you may warm yourselves\u0027 (tastalna: the t\u0027 replaces the t\u0027 of the [8th verbal paradigm] ifta\u0060ala of the verb saliya, or salaya).",
  "And when he reached it, a call came from the right bank, [the right] side, of the valley, to Moses, at the blessed spot, [blessed] for Moses, because of his hearing God\u0027s speech therein, from the tree (mina\u0027l- shajarati substitutes for min shti\u0027i, \u0060from the [right] bank\u0027, and the preposition [min, \u0060from\u0027] has been repeated because it [the tree] grows there) -- the tree was a jujube, a bramble, or a boxthorn -- [saying] that (an here is explicative, and not in its softened form) \u0060O Moses! Indeed I am God, the Lord of the Worlds\u0027.",
  "And: \u0060Throw down your staff\u0027, and he threw it down. And when he saw it quivering, moving, as if it were a serpent (jnn: is a small snake [so called] because of the speed of its movement) he turned his back, to flee from it, and did not look back, in other words, he did not return, and so there called out [the voice]: \u0060O Moses! Come forward, and do not be afraid. Indeed you are safe.",
  "Insert your, right, hand, meaning, the palm, into your bosom (jayb is the neck [area] of the shirt) and [then] take it out, and it will emerge, not in its usual skin colour [but], white, without any blemish, any [vestige of] leprosy. So he inserted it and took it out and it shone as bright as the sun, blinding the eyes; and draw your arm [back] to your side [as a precaution] against fear (read rahab, rahb or ruhb), in other words, [against] the fear produced by the glow of the hand, so that you insert it [back] into your bosom and it is restored to its former state; it [the arm] is referred to as jinh, \u0060wing\u0027, because they are for humans what wings are for birds. These then (read fa-dhnika or fa-dhnnika) namely, the staff and the hand (both of which [\u0060as and yad] are feminine nouns, but the demonstrative pronoun [dhnika] used for them, being the subject, is in the masculine because its predicate is masculine) shall be two proofs, to be sent, from your Lord to Pharaoh and his council; for surely they are an immoral people\u0027.",
  "He said, \u0060My Lord, I have indeed slain a soul among them -- the mentioned Egyptian -- and so I fear that they will slay me, because of him.",
  "And my brother Aaron is more eloquent, more intelligible, than me in speech. So send him with me as a helper, as an aid (a variant reading [for rid\u0027an, \u0060helper\u0027] is ridan) to confirm me (read [either] in apocopated form, yusadiqn, as a response to the request, or [as an indicative] with damma inflection, yusadiqun, as an adjectival qualification of rid\u0027an, \u0060helper\u0027), for I truly fear that they will deny me\u0027.",
  "He said, \u0060We will strengthen your arm, We will make you strong, by means of your brother, and We will give authority, victory, so that they will not be able to touch [either of] you, with any evil; go both of you, with Our signs the two of you, and those who follow you [two], will be the victors\u0027, over them.",
  "But when Moses brought them Our clear signs (bayyintin, a circumstantial qualifier) they said, \u0060This is nothing but concocted, invented, sorcery. And we never heard of such [a thing], to have [ever] existed, in, the days of, our forefathers\u0027.",
  "And Moses said, (wa-qla, or qla, without the \u0060and\u0027) \u0060My Lord knows best who brings guidance from Him (the suffixed pronoun [in \u0060indihi] refers to the Lord) and whose (man here is a supplement to the previous man) will be (read takna or yakna) the sequel of the [Blissful] Abode, that is to say, the praiseworthy sequel in the Abode of the Hereafter, in other words, it is I [Moses], in both cases, and I speak truthfully in what I have brought [you]. Truly the evildoers, the disbelievers, will not be successful\u0027.",
  "And Pharaoh said, \u0060O [members of the] council, I do not know of any god for you other than me. So kindle for me, O Hmn, [a fire] over the clay, and bake for me bricks [of clay], and make me a tower, a lofty palace, that I may take a look at the god of Moses, to observe him and inspect him; for truly I consider him to be a liar\u0027, in his claim of [the existence of] some other god and that he is his messenger.",
  "And he and his hosts acted arrogantly in the land, the land of Egypt, without right, and thought they would not return to Us (read active yarji\u0060na, or passive yurja\u0060na, \u0060they would [not] be brought back\u0027).",
  "So We seized him and his hosts, and flung them into the waters, the sea, and they drowned. So behold how was the sequel for the evildoers, when they ended up being destroyed.",
  "And We made them, in this world, leaders (read a-imma, pronouncing both hamzas, or by changing the second one into a y\u0027), chieftains of idolatry, who invite to the Fire, by inviting to idolatry, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped, by having the chastisement averted from them.",
  "And We made a curse, ignominy, pursue them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the spurned, those banished [from God\u0027s mercy].",
  "And verily We gave Moses the Scripture, the Torah, after We had destroyed the former generations, the people of Noah, \u0060d, Thamd and others, [containing] eye-openers for mankind (bas\u0027ira, is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-kitb, \u0060the Scripture\u0027, the plural of basra, which is the [perceptive] light of the heart), in other words, illumination for the hearts [of mankind], and as guidance, from error, for those who implement it, and mercy, for those who believe therein, that perhaps they might remember, [that] they might be admonished by the admonitions it [the Scripture] contains.",
  "And you were not, O Muhammad (s), on the western side, of the mountain, the valley, or the spot, [to the west] of Moses at the time of the communion, when We decreed, revealed, to Moses the commandment, to deliver the Message to Pharaoh and his people, nor were you among the witnesses, to this, to know it and inform of it;",
  "but We brought forth generations, communities, after Moses, and life was prolonged in their case, in other words, they lived long lives and so they forgot the covenants [made with God], knowledge disappeared and revelation ceased. Then We brought you as Messenger and revealed to you the story of Moses and others. And you were not a dweller, a resident, among the people of Midian reciting to them Our revelations (tatl \u0060alayhim ytin, a second predicate [after thwiyan, \u0060dweller\u0027), to know their story and inform of it; but truly We are the senders, of you [as Messenger] and [the senders] to you of the stories of former generations.",
  "And you were not on the side of the Mount when We called out, to Moses to take the Scripture earnestly; but, We have sent you, as a mercy from your Lord, that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you -- these are the people of Mecca -- and that perhaps they may remember, they may be admonished.",
  "Otherwise, if an affliction, a punishment, should befall them because of what their own hands have sent before them, in the way of disbelief and otherwise, they might say, \u0060Our Lord, why did You not send a messenger to us, that we might have followed Your signs, the ones sent with the messengers, and been of the believers?\u0027 (the response to [the conditional particle] lawl, \u0060if\u0027, has been omitted, and what follows it is a [new] subject; the meaning is: \u0060were it not for the affliction that is the cause of their saying\u0027, or, \u0060were it not for their saying that is the cause of their affliction, We would have hastened on for them their punishment and We would not have sent you as a messenger to them\u0027).",
  "But when the truth, namely, Muhammad (s), came to them from Us, they said, \u0060Why has he not been given the like of what Moses was given?\u0027, in the way of signs, such as the glowing hand, the staff and others, or [by having] the Book revealed all at once. God, exalted be He, says: And did they not disbelieve in what was given to Moses before?; [before] when, they said, regarding him and Muhammad (s), \u0060Two sorcerers (shirn; a variant reading has sihrn, \u0060two sorceries\u0027, namely [what they said regarding] the Qur\u0027n and the Torah) abetting each other.\u0027 And they said, \u0060We indeed disbelieve in both\u0027, the two prophets and the two Scriptures [of Moses and Muhammad].",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Then bring some Scripture from God that is better in guidance than these two, Scriptures, that I may follow it, if you are truthful\u0027, in what you say.",
  "Then if they do not respond to you, regarding your invitation [to them] to bring a Scripture, know that they are only following their desires, in [persisting in] their disbelief. And who is more astray than he who follows his desire without any guidance from God?, in other words, there is no one more astray than such [a person]. Truly God does not guide the evildoing, the disbelieving, folk.",
  "And now verily We have brought, We have explained [to], them the Word, the Qur\u0027n, that perhaps they might remember, [they might] be admonished and believe.",
  "Those to whom We gave the Scripture before this, that is, [before] the Qur\u0027n, they believe in it, too. This was revealed regarding certain Jews who became Muslims, such as \u0060Abd Allh b. Salm and others, and [certain] Christians who had come from Abyssinia and Syria [who also became Muslims].",
  "And, when it is recited to them, the Qur\u0027n, they say, \u0060We believe in it. It is indeed the Truth from our Lord. Lo! [even] before it we had submitted\u0027, we affirmed God\u0027s Oneness.",
  "Those will be given their reward twice over, for believing in both Scriptures, for the patience they showed, for having been steadfast in implementing [the prescriptions in] them; and they ward off, from themselves, evil with good, and expend, give as voluntary alms, of that which We have provided them.",
  "And when they hear vanity, vile words and hurtful intent from the disbelievers, they disregard it and say, \u0060To us [belong] our deeds and to you [belong] your deeds. Peace to you -- a parting truce (salm mutraka), in other words you are secure from any abuse or the like on our part. We do not desire [friendship with] the ignorant\u0027, we do not seek companionship with them.",
  "The following was revealed regarding the Prophet\u0027s longing for his uncle Ab Tlib to embrace faith: You cannot guide whom you like, to be guided, but [it is] God [Who] guides whomever He will, and He knows best those who will be guided.",
  "And they, his people, say, \u0060If we were to follow the Guidance with you, we will be deprived from our land\u0027, torn out of it swiftly. God, exalted be He, says: Have We not established for them a secure Sanctuary, [one] in which they are secure from the raids and killings that occur among the Arab tribes, to which are brought (read tujb or yujb) fruits of all kinds, [fruits] from every direction, as a provision, for them, from Us? But most of them do not know, that what We say is the truth.",
  "And how many a town We have destroyed whose lifestyle was one of arrogant ungratefulness -- by \u0060town\u0027 is meant the inhabitants thereof. Those are their dwellings, which have not been dwelt in after them except a little, by passers-by, for a day or part of it. And it was We Who were the [sole] inheritors, after them.",
  "And your Lord never destroyed the towns, because of evildoing on their part, until He had raised up in their mother-town, that is, the major [town] among them, a messenger to recite Our signs to them. And We never destroyed the towns unless their inhabitants were committing evil, by denying the messengers.",
  "And whatever things you have been given are [only] the [short-lived] enjoyment of the life of this world and an ornament thereof, in other words, [things] which you enjoy and adorn yourselves with for the days of your lives, after which they perish; and what is with God, in other words, His reward, is better and more lasting. Will you not understand? (ta\u0060qilna; or read ya\u0060qilna, \u0060will they [not] understand\u0027) that what lasts is better than what perishes.",
  "Is he to whom We have given a fair promise, which he will receive, which he will attain, and that [promise] is Paradise, like him to whom We have given the enjoyment of the life of this world, [enjoyment] which will disappear soon, then on the Day of Resurrection he will be of those arraigned?, before the Fire. The former is the believer, the latter the disbeliever: in other words the two are not equal.",
  "And, mention, the day when He, God, will call to them and say, \u0060Where [then] are My partners, those whom you used to claim?\u0027, were partners of Mine.",
  "Those against whom the Word [of punishment] will have become due, the justified [Word], that they be admitted into the Fire -- and these are the leaders of misguidance -- they shall say, \u0060Our Lord! These are the ones whom we led astray (h\u0027l\u0027i\u0027lladhna aghwayn is both a subject and an adjectival qualification). We led them astray (aghwaynhum, the predicate thereof) and they went astray, even as we went astray -- we did not compel them to [follow] error. We declare our innocence, of them, before You; it was not us that they worshipped\u0027 (m, \u0060not\u0027, is for negation; the direct object [iyyn, \u0060us\u0027] precedes [the verb ya\u0060budna, \u0060they worshipped\u0027] in order to concord with the end-rhyme of the verses).",
  "And it shall be said, \u0060Call [now] to your associates!\u0027, namely, the idols you alleged to be partners of God. So they will call to them, but they will not answer them, their call, and they, the former, will see, they will sight, the chastisement: [they will wish] if only they had been guided!, in this world, they would not have seen it in the Hereafter.",
  "And, mention, the day when He will call to them and say, \u0060What response did you give to those [messengers] who were sent?\u0027, to you.",
  "The tidings, the news of deliverance contained in the response, will be obscured to them on that day, in other words, they will not find any statement that might contain [hope of] deliverance for them; so they will not question one other, about this, and will fall silent.",
  "But as for him who repents, of idolatry, and believes, in the affirmation of God\u0027s Oneness, and acts righteously, he observes the duties [of religion], maybe he will be among the successful, those delivered according to God\u0027s promise.",
  "And your Lord creates whatever He will and chooses, whatever He will. They, the idolaters, do not have the choice, the right to choose anything. Glory be to God and exalted be He above what they associate, [above] their idolatry.",
  "And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal, [what] their hearts keep secret of disbelief and otherwise, and what they proclaim, by their tongues of such things.",
  "And He is God; there is no god except Him. To Him belongs [all] praise in the former, namely, the life of this world, and in the latter, Paradise. And to Him belongs the judgement, the decree effective in [the case of] all things, and to Him you will be returned, through resurrection.",
  "Say, to the people of Mecca: \u0060Have you considered, in other words, inform Me: if God were to make the night everlasting over you until the Day of Resurrection, what god other than God, as you [are wont to] claim, could bring you light?, daylight [hours] during which you could earn [a living]. Will you not then listen?\u0027, to this in a way so as to understand it and so repent of your idolatry.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060Have you considered, if God were to make the day everlasting over you until the Day of Resurrection, what god other than God, as you [are wont to] claim, could bring you night wherein you rest?, from [any] weariness. Will you not then see?, the error you are upon when you ascribe partners [to God], and so repent of it.",
  "And of His mercy, exalted be He, He has made for you night and day, that you may rest therein, in the night, and that you may seek, in the day, of His bounty, to earn [your livelihood], that perhaps you might give thanks\u0027, for the grace [of God] during both of these [times].",
  "And, mention, the day when He will call to them and say, \u0060Where [now] are My associates those whom you used to claim?\u0027 -- this is mentioned again in order to expound upon it:",
  "And We shall draw, bring forth, from every community a witness, and this will be their prophet, who will bear witness against what they say, and We shall say, to them: \u0060Produce your evidence\u0027, for [the justification of] the idolatry which you asserted. Then they will know that the right, to divineness, is God\u0027s -- none share it with Him. And that which they used to invent, in this world, of His having an associate, exalted be He [high] above such [associations], will fail them.",
  "Indeed Korah belonged to the people of Moses -- [being] his paternal and maternal cousin, and he had believed in him [in Moses] -- but he became insolent towards them, through [his] disdain, haughtiness and great wealth. For We had given him so many treasures that [the number of] their keys would verily have burdened a group of strong men, in other words, they would have been too heavy for such [men] (the b\u0027 of [bi\u0027l-\u0060usbati, \u0060a group\u0027] is to render transitive [the intransitive] verb); the number of such [men required] is estimated to be 70, 40 or 10; other estimates are also given. Mention, when his people, the believers among the Children of Israel, said to him, \u0060Do not be exultant, in [your] great wealth, an exultation of insolence; truly God does not love the exultant, in such [things];",
  "but seek, in that which God has given you, of wealth, the Abode of the Hereafter, by expending it in obedience to God, and do not forget your share of this world, that is, [do not forget] to strive in it for the sake of the Hereafter; and be good, to people, by [giving] voluntary alms, just as God has been good to you. And do not seek to cause corruption in the earth, by committing acts of disobedience. Surely God does not love the agents of corruption\u0027, meaning that He will punish them.",
  "He said, \u0060In fact I have been given it, that is, [this] wealth, because of knowledge I possess\u0027, in other words, in return for it -- he was the most knowledgeable of the Children of Israel in the Torah, after Moses and Aaron. God, exalted be He, says: Does he not know that God had already destroyed before him generations, communities, of men stronger than him in might and greater in the amassing?, of wealth; in other words, he does know this. And God destroys them, and the guilty will not be questioned about their sins, because of God\u0027s knowledge of these [sins], and so they will be admitted into the Fire without a reckoning.",
  "So he, Korah, emerged before his people in his finery, with his large retinue [all of them] in procession dressed in gold and silk garments and mounted on adorned horses and mules. Those who desired the life of this world said, \u0060O (y is for drawing attention) would that we had the like of what Korah has been given, this world. Truly he enjoys great fortune\u0027, abundant [fortune] in it.",
  "But those to whom knowledge had been given, [knowledge] of what God had promised in the Hereafter, said, to them: \u0060Woe to you! (waylakum, is an expression of reprimand) God\u0027s reward, of Paradise in the Hereafter, is better for him who believes and acts righteously, than what Korah has been given in this world; and none will obtain it, namely, the Paradise that is given as a reward, except those who are steadfast\u0027, in [their adherence to] obedience and [refrain] from disobedience.",
  "So We caused the earth to swallow him, Korah, and his dwelling, and he had no host to help him besides God, that is, other than Him, to protect him from destruction, nor was he of those who can rescue themselves, from it.",
  "And those who had longed to be in his place the day before, that is, only recently, were saying, \u0060Alas! God expands provision for whomever He will of His servants and straitens [it], He restricts it for whomever He will (way-ka\u0027anna: way is a noun of action, with the sense of \u0060How astonished I am\u0027, while the kf functions as a [causative] lm, \u0060because\u0027). Had God not been gracious to us, He would have made us to be swallowed too\u0027 (read active la-khasafa, or passive la-khusifa). Lo! indeed those who are ungrateful, for God\u0027s grace, such as Korah, never prosper.",
  "That is the Abode of the Hereafter, namely, Paradise, which We shall grant to those who do not desire to be haughty in the earth, through insolence, nor [to cause] corruption, by committing acts of disobedience. And the, praiseworthy, sequel will be for those who fear, God\u0027s punishment, by performing deeds of obedience.",
  "Whoever brings a good deed shall have better than it, as a reward, because of it, and this will be the like of it tenfold; while whoever brings an evil deed, those who commit evil deeds shall only be requited, the requital, for what they used to do, in other words, [only] the like of it.",
  "Indeed He Who has prescribed for you the Qur\u0027n, [He Who] has revealed it, will surely restore you to a place of return, to Mecca -- he had yearned for it. Say: \u0060My Lord knows best him who brings guidance and him who is in manifest error\u0027 -- this was revealed in order to refute what the Meccan disbelievers had said to him: \u0060Indeed, you are error\u0027. In other words [God is saying that] he [the Prophet] is the one who has brought guidance, while they are the ones in error.",
  "And you never expected that the Scripture, the Qur\u0027n, would be conferred on you; but it was, conferred on you, as a mercy from your Lord. So never be a supporter of the disbelievers, in that religion of theirs to which they summon you.",
  "And never let them bar you (yasuddunnaka is actually yasuddnannaka, but the nn of the indicative [ending] has been omitted because of the apocopating particle [l], as has the ww of the [third person plural] subject of the verb because of its coming together with an unvocalised nn) from God\u0027s signs after they have been revealed to you, in other words, do not consult with them in such [matters], and summon, people, to your Lord, by affirming His Oneness and worshipping Him, and never be of the idolaters, by supporting them (l taknanna: the apocopating particle does not affect the [ending of the] verb here because of its invariability).",
  "And do not call on, [do not] worship, another god with God; there is no god except Him. Everything will perish except His Countenance, except Him. His is the judgement, the effective decree, and to Him you will be brought back, by being raised from the grave. Meccan, except for verses 1 to 11 inclusive, which are Medinese; it consists of 69 verses revealed after [srat] al-Rm.",
  "Alif lm mm: God knows best what He means by these [letters].",
  "Do people suppose that they will be left to say, that is, [that they will be left alone] because of their saying, \u0060We believe\u0027, and they will not be tried?, tested with that which will reveal the sincerity of their belief. This [verse] was revealed regarding a group of individuals who when they became believers endured suffering at the hands of the idolaters.",
  "And certainly We tried those who were before them. So God shall surely know those who are sincere, in their faith -- a knowledge of direct vision -- and He shall surely know those who are liars, regarding it.",
  "Or do those who commit evil deeds, idolatry and acts of disobedience, suppose that they can elude Us?, so that We will not be able to requite them. Evil is that, judgement of theirs, which they judge!",
  "Whoever expects to encounter God, [should know that] God\u0027s [appointed] term, for this [encounter], will indeed come; so let him prepare for it. And He is the Hearer, of the sayings of His servants, the Knower, of their actions.",
  "And whoever struggles, in war or against [the temptations of] his own soul, struggles only for his own sake, because the benefits [to be reaped] from his struggle will be for his sake and not for God\u0027s. For truly God is Independent of [the creatures of] all the Worlds, mankind, jinn and angels, and [He is also without need] of their worship.",
  "And those who believe and perform righteous deeds, We will surely absolve them of their misdeeds, by their performance of righteous deeds, and We will indeed requite them with the best of what they used to do, namely, their righteous deeds (it [ahsana] is in the accusative because the operator of the oblique [bi] has been omitted).",
  "And We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents, that he should be dutiful towards them; but if they urge you to ascribe to Me as partner that of which you do not have any knowledge, [any knowledge] that accords with reality, and so is meaningless, then do not obey them, in [such incitements to] idolatry. To Me will be your return whereat I will inform you of what you used to do, and I will requite you for it.",
  "And those who believe and perform righteous deeds, assuredly We shall admit them among the righteous, [among] the prophets and the saints, by gathering in the company of one another [at the Resurrection].",
  "And among people there are those who say, \u0060We believe in God\u0027, but if such [a person] suffers hurt in God\u0027s cause, he takes people\u0027s persecution, that is, their harming of him, to be [the same] as God\u0027s chastisement, in terms of his fear of it, and so he obeys them and behaves hypocritically. Yet if (la-in: the lm is for oaths) there comes help, to believers, from your Lord, and they take spoils, they will assuredly say (la-yaqlunna: the [final] nn [of the indicative] has been omitted because of the other nn coming after it, and likewise the ww, indicating the plural person [has been replaced by a damma], because of two unvocalised consonants coming together), \u0060We were indeed with you\u0027, in faith, so give us a share of the booty. God, exalted be He, says: Does God not know best what is in the breasts of all creatures?, [what is] in their hearts of faith or hypocrisy? Indeed [He does].",
  "And God shall surely ascertain those who believe, in their hearts, and He shall surely ascertain the hypocrites, and He will requite each group accordingly (the lm in both verbs [la-ya\u0060lamanna, \u0060He shall ascertain\u0027] is for oaths).",
  "And those who disbelieve say to those who believe, \u0060Follow our path, our religion, and we will bear [responsibility for] your sins\u0027, when you follow us, should there be any [such sins] (the imperative here functions as a predicate). God, exalted be He, says: But they will not [be able to] bear anything of their sins. Truly they are liars, in [saying] this.",
  "And they shall certainly bear their [own] burdens, their sins, and other burdens along with their [own] burdens, [as punishment] for saying to believers: Follow our path [previous verse] and for their leading astray those who follow them [blindly]; and on the Day of Resurrection they shall surely be questioned concerning what they used to invent, [what] they used to fabricate of lies against God, a questioning of rebuke (the lm in both verbs [la-yahmilunna and la-yus\u0027alunna] is for oaths; in both [verbs] the [plural] indicators of the subject, ww and nn [-na], have been omitted).",
  "And verily We sent Noah to his people, when he was forty years of age or older, and he remained among them a thousand-less-fifty years, calling them to affirm God\u0027s Oneness, but they denied him; so the Flood engulfed them, a deluge of water drifted against them, rising above them and drowning them, for they were wrongdoers, idolaters.",
  "Then We delivered him, namely, Noah, and the occupants of the ship, those who were with him in it, and We made this a sign, a lesson, for all peoples, for [all] peoples that would come after them, should they disobey the messengers sent to them. Noah lived for a further sixty years or more after the Flood, until mankind multiplied [again].",
  "And, mention, Abraham, when he said to his people, \u0060Worship God and fear Him, fear His punishment; that is better for you, than the worship of idols which you practice, if you only knew, what is good from what is otherwise.",
  "What you worship besides God, that is, other than Him, are only graven images and you fabricate a calumny, you speak lies [such as]: \u0060[These] graven images are God\u0027s partners\u0027. Truly those whom you worship besides God have no power to provide for you. So seek your provision from God, request it from Him, and worship Him, and be thankful to Him; to Him you shall be returned.",
  "But if you deny, that is, if you deny me, O people of Mecca, then [many] communities have denied before you, that is, before my time; and the messenger\u0027s duty is only to communicate [the Message] clearly\u0027. Both stories are meant to comfort the Prophet (s). And regarding his people, God, exalted be He, says:",
  "Have they not seen (yaraw, or taraw, \u0060have you not seen?\u0027), observed, how God originates creation (yubdi\u0027u, from [4th form] abda\u0027a; a variant reading has yabda\u0060u from [1st form] bada\u0027a, both with the same meaning: \u0060He creates them originally\u0027) then, He, restores it, namely, creation, just as He originated them? Surely that, which is mentioned of the first and the second [acts of] creation, is easy for God, so how can they deny the second one?",
  "Say: \u0060Travel in the land and observe how He originated creation, of those before you, and [how He] made them die. Then God shall bring about the other genesis (al-nash\u0027a, or al-nash\u0027a). Truly God has power over all things, among them the origination [of creation] and the restoration [thereof].",
  "He chastises whomever He will, to chastise, and has mercy on whomever He will, to have mercy, and to Him you shall be returned.",
  "And you will never be able to thwart [Him], your Lord [and prevent Him] from catching up with you, on earth, or in the heaven, were you to be in it, in other words, you cannot elude Him; and you do not have besides God, that is, other than Him, any guardian, to defend you against Him, or any helper, to help you [escape] from His chastisement.",
  "And those who disbelieve in God\u0027s signs and the encounter with Him, namely, the Qur\u0027n and the Resurrection [respectively], they have despaired of My mercy, that is, [of attaining] My Paradise, and for those there shall be a painful chastisement.",
  "God, exalted be He, says with regard to the tale of Abraham, peace be upon him: But the only answer of his people was that they said, \u0060Slay him, or burn him!\u0027 Then God delivered him from the fire, into which they threw him, by making it cool and harmless for him. Surely in that, namely, [in that] deliverance of him from it, there are signs -- namely, the fact that it did not have any affect on him despite its greatness, and the fact that it was extinguished and that within a brief period meadows sprung up in its place -- for a people who believe, [a people who] affirm the truth of God\u0027s Oneness and His power, for they are the ones to benefit from these [signs].",
  "And he, Abraham, said: \u0060You have adopted mere idols besides God, which you worship (m [of innam] relates to the verbal noun) for the sake of [mutual] affection between you (mawaddatu baynikum: this is the predicate of inna [of innam]; the accusative reading [mawaddata baynikum] would denote a direct object denoting reason, so that the m would denote \u0060entirety\u0027) -- in other words, you are friends of one another in your worship of them, in the life of this world. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will disown one another, the leaders will dissociate from those who followed [them]; and you will curse one another, those who followed will curse their leaders; and your abode, your destination all together, will be the Fire, and you will have no helpers\u0027, to protect you against it.",
  "And Lot believed in him, he affirmed the sincerity of Abraham, and he was his [paternal] nephew, from his brother Hrn, and he, Abraham, said, \u0060Indeed I am migrating, away from my people, toward my Lord, to where my Lord commands. So he shunned his people and emigrated from the rural lands of Iraq to Syria. Indeed He is the Mighty, in His kingdom, the Wise\u0027, in what He does.",
  "And We gave him, after Ishmael, Isaac, and Jacob, after Isaac; and We ordained among his descendants prophethood, thus all prophets after Abraham are descended from him, and the Scripture, meaning, the [Holy] Books, the Torah, the Gospels, the Psalms and the Criterion (al-furqn). And We gave him his reward in this world, which is fair praise [of him] by members of all the [Abrahamic] religions. And in the Hereafter he shall truly be among the righteous, for whom there shall be the highest degrees [of reward].",
  "And, mention, Lot, when he said to his people \u0060Truly you (read a-innakum, pronouncing both hamzas, or not pronouncing the second and inserting an alif between the two in either case and in both instances) commit lewdness, namely, [coming in unto] the rears of men, such as none in [all] the worlds, of jinn or men, has committed before you.",
  "What! Do you come unto men, and cut off the way, the [travel] roads of passers-by, committing lewd acts with whoever passes your way, such that people ceased to pass by [where] you [live], and you discuss in your gatherings, in your conversations, indecency?\u0027, [you discuss] committing lewd acts with one another. But the only answer of his people was that they said, \u0060Bring us the chastisement of God, if you are truthful\u0027, in your deeming such [acts] vile and that chastisement will befall those who do such things.",
  "He said, \u0060My Lord, help me, by making that of which I spoke come true regarding the sending down of chastisement, against the people who work corruption\u0027, those who are disobedient, by coming unto men. So God answered his call.",
  "And when Our messengers came to Abraham with the good tidings, of Isaac and Jacob after him, they said, \u0060We shall assuredly destroy the people of this town, namely, the town of Lot, for truly its people are evildoers\u0027, disbelievers.",
  "He, Abraham, said, \u0060Lo! Lot is in it.\u0027 They, namely, the messengers, said, \u0060We know very well who is in it. Assuredly We shall deliver him (read la-nunjiyannahu or la-nunajjiyannahu) and his family, except his wife: she is of those who will stay behind\u0027, [of those] who will remain behind in the chastisement.",
  "And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was distressed on their account, he was grieved because of them, and he was constrained [unable] to help them, because they had handsome faces, dressed as guests, and thus he feared for them from his people. So they informed him that they were the messengers of his Lord. But they said, \u0060Do not be afraid, nor grieve. We shall surely deliver you (read munajjka or munjka) and your family, except your wife: she is of those who will remain behind (ahlaka, \u0060your family\u0027, is in the accusative as a supplement to the [suffixed direct object pronoun] kf [of munajjka, \u0060We shall surely deliver you\u0027]).",

  "And, We destroyed, Korah, and Pharaoh, and Hmn! And verily Moses brought them, beforehand, clear signs, manifest proofs, but they acted arrogantly in the land; and they could not thwart Us, they could not elude Our chastisement.",
  "So each, of those mentioned, We seized for his sin; and among them were some upon whom We unleashed a squall of stones, as in the case of the people of Lot, and among them were some who were seized by the Cry, such as Thamd, and among them were some whom We made the earth swallow, such as Korah, and among them were some whom We drowned, like the people of Noah, Pharaoh and his people. And God never wronged them, by chastising them for [having committed] no sin, but they wronged themselves, by committing sins.",
  "The likeness of those who choose besides God [other] patrons, namely, idols, from whom they hope to profit, is as the likeness of the spider that makes a home, for itself in which to shelter.

Surely in that, Book, is mercy and a reminder, an admonition, for a people who believe.",
  "Say: \u0060God suffices as a witness between me and you\u0027, of my sincerity. He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth, including my circumstances and yours. And those who believe in falsehood, namely, all that is worshipped besides God, and [who] disbelieve in God, from among you -- those, they are the losers, in their bargain, for they have purchased disbelief in return for faith.",

  "And of His signs, exalted be He, is that He unleashes the winds as bearers of good tidings, meaning, so that they may bring you good tidings of rain, and that He may let you taste, thereby, of His mercy, namely, [in the way of] rain and fertile soil, and that the ships may run, thereby, by His command, by His will, and that you may seek, [that you may] request of, His bounty, provision, by way of commerce at sea, and that perhaps you might [then] give thanks, for these graces, O people of Mecca, and so affirm His Oneness.",
  "And verily We sent before you messengers to their people and they brought them clear signs, plain proofs of their sincerity concerning their Message to them, but they denied them. Then We took vengeance upon those who were guilty, We destroyed those who denied them, and it was ever incumbent upon Us to give victory to the believers, over the disbelievers, by destroying these and delivering the believers.",
  "God is the One Who unleashes the winds which then raise, stir up, clouds, and He then spreads them across the heaven as He will, in small or large quantities, and He forms them into fragments (read kisafan or kisfan: \u0060scattered pieces\u0027) then you see the rain issuing out of them, that is, out of the midst of them. Then when He drops it, the rain, upon whomever of His servants He will, lo! they rejoice, they are happy because of the rain.",
  "Though indeed before it was sent down upon them, before that (min qablihi is [repeated] for emphasis) they had been despondent, despairing of its sending down.",
  "So behold the effects (a variant reading has [singular] athar, \u0060the effect\u0027) of God\u0027s mercy, that is, His grace in giving [them] rain, how He revives the earth after it has died, [after] it has dried out, so that it produces vegetation [again]. Surely He is the Reviver of the dead and He has power over all things.",
  "But if (wa-la-in, the lm is for oaths) We unleash a [different] wind, that damages vegetation, and they see it turn yellow, they would begin (la-zall is the response to the [conditional] oath) after that, that is, after its turning yellow, to disbelieve, to deny the grace of [having been given] rain.",
  "And so you cannot make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call when (read al-du\u0060\u0027a idh, pronouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the second one [that comes] between it and the y\u0027) they go away with their backs turned.",
  "Nor can you guide the blind out of their error. You can only make hear, in a way so as to understand and accept, those who believe in Our signs, [in] the Qur\u0027n, and have thus submitted, sincere in their affirmation of God\u0027s Oneness.",
  "God is the One Who created you from [a state of] weakness, [from] a \u0060base fluid\u0027 [cf. Q. 32:8], then He ordained after, a second, weakness, which is the weakness of [the period of] childhood, strength, that is, the strength of youth, then after strength He appointed weakness [again] and grey hair, the weakness of old age and the grey hairs of decrepitude (read [vocalised as] du\u0060f, \u0060weakness\u0027, in all three places). He creates what He will, of weakness and strength, youth and grey hairs, and He is the Knower, of how to manage His creatures, the Omnipotent.",
  "And on the Day when the Hour comes the guilty, the disbelievers, shall swear that they had not remained more than an hour, in the grave. God, exalted be He, says: That is how they use to be deceived, [how] they used to be turned away from the truth -- the Resurrection -- similar to the way in which they have [now] been turned away from the real truth about how long they had remained.",
  "But those who have been given knowledge and faith, of angels and others, shall say, \u0060You have remained according to God\u0027s decree, in accordance with what He had decreed [for you] in His prior knowledge, until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of Resurrection, which you rejected, but you did not know\u0027, that it would come to pass.",
  "So on that day their excuses, for denying it, will not profit (read l yanfa\u0060u or l tanfa\u0060u) the evildoers, nor will they be asked to make amends (yusta\u0060tabna means \u0060they will [not] be asked for al-\u0060utb\u0027, which denotes \u0060a return to that which pleases God\u0027).",
  "And verily We have struck, We have coined, for mankind in this Qur\u0027n every [kind of] similitude, as a way of cautioning them. And if (wa-la-in, the lm is for oaths) you, O Muhammad (s), were to bring them a [miraculous] sign, such as the staff or the hand in the case of Moses, those who disbelieve, from among them, will certainly say (la-yaqlanna: the indicative nn has been omitted because of the other nn coming after it, and likewise the ww [replaced by the damma in lu], because of two unvocalised consonants coming together and it indicates the plural person), \u0060You -- in other words, Muhammad (s) and his Companions -- are nothing but followers of falsehood\u0027.",
  "Thus does God seal the hearts of those who do not know, [anything of] God\u0027s Oneness, in the same way that He has sealed the hearts of these [aforementioned individuals].",
  "So be patient. Surely God\u0027s promise, to give you victory over them, is true. And do not let them cause you to be inconstant, those who are uncertain, of the Resurrection, in other words, do not let them cause you to succumb to inconstancy and frivolity by abandoning patience, that is to say, do not abandon it. Meccan, except for verses 27, 28 and 29, which are Medinese; it consists of 34 verses revealed after [srat] al-Sfft.",
  "Alif lm mm: God knows best what He means by these [letters].",
  "Those, namely, these signs, are the signs of the wise Book, the Qur\u0027n, the one containing wisdom (the genitive annexation [ytu\u0027l-kitbi\u0027l-hakm] has the [partitive] meaning of min, \u0060from\u0027);",
  "it is, a guidance and a mercy (read nominative rahmatun; the popular accusative reading [rahmatan] would make it a circumstantial qualifier referring to yt, \u0060signs\u0027, the operator of which being the implicit demonstrative import of tilka, \u0060those\u0027) for the virtuous,",
  "who maintain the prayer (alladhna yuqmna\u0027l-salta, an explication of al-muhsinna, \u0060the virtuous\u0027) and pay the alms and who are certain of the Hereafter (the repetition of hum, \u0060they\u0027 [here translated \u0060who\u0027] is for emphasis).",
  "Such follow guidance from their Lord and it is they who are the successful, the winners.",
  "And among people there is he who purchases idle talk, in other words, that [part of it] which diverts [people] from its [true] significance, that he may lead [people] astray (read li-yadilla; or li-yudilla) from the way of God, the religion of Islam, without knowledge and take it (read [subjunctive] wa-yattakhidhah as a supplement to yudilla, \u0060that he may lead astray\u0027; or [indicative] wa-yattakhidhuh as a supplement to yashtar, \u0060who buys\u0027) in mockery, as something to be mocked. For such there will be a humiliating chastisement, one of abasement.",
  "And when Our signs, in other words, [in] the Qur\u0027n, are recited to such [a one] he turns away disdainfully as though he never heard them, as though there were a deafness in his ears (both comparisons constitute two circumstantial qualifiers referring to the subject of [the verb] wall, \u0060turns away\u0027; or it is that the second [comparison] is an explication of the first). So give him tidings of, inform him of, a painful chastisement. The use of [the expression] \u0060good tidings\u0027 meant derisively against such [a person] -- this was al-Nadr b. al- Hrith. He used to visit al-Hra for commerce and purchase books containing the stories of the non-Arab peoples and then recount these to the people of Mecca. He would say, \u0060Muhammad recounts to you the stories of \u0060d and Thamd, whereas I relate to you the stories of the Persians and the Byzantines!\u0027 They would thus [go to] enjoy his stories and neglect to listen to the Qur\u0027n.",
  "Surely those who believe and perform righteous deeds, for them there shall be Gardens of Bliss,",
  "abiding therein (khlidna fh, is a circumstantial qualification [of a future status]), in other words, their abiding therein will have been ordained once they enter it -- a promise of God in truth, that is to say, God promised them this and realised it in truth; and He is the Mighty, Whom nothing can overwhelm and so prevent Him from fulfilling His promise and His threat [of chastisement], the Wise, the One Who assigns all things to their rightful places.",
  "He created the heavens without any pillars that you can see (\u0060amad is the plural of \u0060imd, which is an ustuwna, \u0060a column\u0027) -- this is the truth since there are no actual pillars -- and cast high mountains into the earth, lest it shake with you, and He dispersed therein all kinds beasts. And We sent down (there is a shift from the third [to the second] person) water from the heaven and We caused to grow in it of every splendid kind, [every] fair specimen.",
  "This is God\u0027s creation, in other words, what is created by Him. Now show me, inform me, O people of Mecca, what those [you worship] besides Him, [those] other than Him, have created, namely, your gods, so that you have associated them with Him, exalted be He (m is an interrogative of denial and a subject; dh has the significance of alladh, and what follows it of the relative clause is the predicate [of the subject m]; arn glosses \u0060the action\u0027, and what follows it stands in place of two direct objects). Nay (bal, is for transition) but the evildoers are in manifest error, [error] that is evident because of their ascribing partners to God: and you are like them.",
  "And verily We gave Luqmn wisdom, comprising knowledge, religiousness, and right-mindedness in speech; his many wisdoms are well-known. He used to give legal opinions [in matters of religion] before David was summoned [to prophethood], but lived on into the latter\u0027s summoning. He then took to acquiring knowledge from him [David] and refrained from giving [any more] legal opinions, explaining this thus: \u0060Should I not be content if someone [like the prophet David] has spared me the trouble?\u0027 He was once asked, \u0060What is the worst kind of person?\u0027 He said, \u0060The one who does not care that people should see him doing evil\u0027. In other words, [We gave him wisdom] and We said to him: \u0060Give thanks to God, for the wisdom that He has given you. Whoever gives thanks only for his own sake, because the reward for his gratitude shall be his, and whoever is ungrateful, for a grace, then surely God is Independent, [without need] of His creation, Praised\u0027, in what He does.",
  "And, mention, when Luqmn said to his son, when he was admonishing him, \u0060O my son (y bunayya is an affectionate diminutive [of y ibn]) do not ascribe partners to God: idolatry is truly a tremendous wrong\u0027, so return to him [in repentance] and submit [to Him].",
  "And We have enjoined man concerning his parents, We commanded him to be dutiful towards them -- his mother bears him, and weakens, in weakness after weakness, that is to say, she is weakened by the pregnancy, the pains of labour and the delivery; and his weaning is in two years, and We said to him [to man]: \u0060Give thanks to Me and to your parents. To Me is the journey\u0027s end, the return.",
  "But if they urge you to ascribe to Me as partner that whereof you have no knowledge, that accords with [any] reality, then do not obey them. And keep them company in this world honourably, in other words, with decency: dutifulness and kindness -- and follow the way of him who returns to Me [in penitence], with [acts of] obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I will inform you of what you used to do, and requite you for it (the [entire] sentence containing the \u0060enjoinder\u0027 [verse 14] and what comes after it constitutes a parenthetical statement).",
  "\u0060O my son! Even if it, namely, the evil trait, should be the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, and [even if] it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, in other words, in the most concealed place therein, God will bring it forth, and He will call [that person] to account for it. Truly God is Subtle, in bringing it forth, Aware, of its location.",
  "O my son! Establish prayer and enjoin decency and forbid indecency. And be patient through whatever may befall you, as a result of such enjoining and forbidding. Truly that, which is mentioned, is true constancy, in other words, that is one of those necessary things regarding which one must have firm resolve.",
  "And do not turn your cheek disdainfully from people (tusa\u0060\u0060ir: a variant reading has tus\u0060ir) do not turn your face away in disdain, and do not walk upon the earth exultantly, in other words, with haughtiness. Truly God does not like any swaggering braggart, strutting in his step, [boasting] in front of people.",
  "And be modest in your bearing, being moderate in it, neither dragging slowly nor rushing, but peaceful and dignified, and lower your voice; indeed the most hideous of voices is the donkey\u0027s voice\u0027, beginning [its hideous bray] with an exhalation and ending with an inhalation.",
  "Do you not see, do you [not] realise, O you who are being addressed, that God has disposed for you whatever is in the heavens, such as the sun, the moon, and the stars, that you may benefit from them, and whatever is in the earth, of fruits, rivers and animals, and He has showered, He has made abundant and made complete, His favours upon you, [both] outwardly, namely, [by giving you your] wholesome form, even limbs and otherwise, and inwardly?, that is, [by giving you] knowledge and so on. Yet among people, that is, [people such as] the Meccan disbelievers, there are those who dispute concerning God without any knowledge or guidance, from a messenger, or an illuminating scripture, revealed by God, rather [they dispute] by [blindly] imitating [others].",
  "And if it is said to them: \u0060Follow what God has revealed\u0027, they say, \u0060We will rather follow what we found our fathers following\u0027. He, exalted be He, says: What! Would they follow such [things], even though Satan were calling them to the chastisement of the Blaze?, that is, to what will bring it about necessarily? No!",
  "And whoever surrenders his purpose to God, that is, [whoever] takes to obeying Him, and is virtuous, a believer in [His] Oneness, has certainly grasped the firmest handle, the stronger end, which is not in danger of being severed, and to God belongs the sequel of all matters, their [ultimate] return.",
  "And whoever disbelieves, then do not let his disbelief grieve you, O Muhammad (s), do not be concerned with his disbelief. To Us shall be their return and We shall inform them of what they did. Truly God knows [best] what is in the breasts, just as [He knows] other things, and so He will requite [them] accordingly.",
  "We will give them comfort, in this world, for a little [while], for the [duration of the] days of their lives, then We will drive them, in the Hereafter, to a harsh chastisement, namely, the chastisement of the Fire from which they will find no escape.",
  "And if (wa-la-in, the lm is for oaths) you were to ask them, \u0060Who created the heavens and the earth?\u0027, they will surely say, \u0060God\u0027 (la-yaqlunna, \u0060they will surely say\u0027, the indicative nn has been omitted because of the like [sc. the nn] coming after it, and likewise the ww of the [plural] person, because of two unvocalised consonants coming together). Say: \u0060Praise be to God\u0027, for the manifestation of the definitive argument against them by the affirmation of the Oneness [of God]. Nay, but most of them do not realise, that this [affirmation] is an obligation upon them.",
  "To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants, and so none other than Him deserves to be worshipped in them. Indeed God, He is the Independent, [without need] of His creatures, the Praised, in His actions.",
  "And if all the trees on earth were pens, and the sea (wa\u0027l-bahru is a supplement to [m] the subject of anna) replenished with seven more seas, were ink, the Words of God would not be spent, [those words] expressing all the things He knows, written in those pens with that [amount of] ink or with even more [ink] than that [would not be spent], for His knowledge, exalted be He, is infinite. Truly God is Mighty, nothing being beyond Him, Wise, from Whose knowledge and wisdom nothing escapes.",
  "Your creation and your resurrection are only as [that of] a single soul, in terms of creation and resurrection, because it is the result of the words kun fa-yakn, \u0060\u0022Be!\u0022 and it is!\u0027 Truly God is Hearer, hearing everything that may be heard, Seer, seeing everything that may be seen, nothing able to distract Him from anything else.",
  "Have you not seen, have you [not] realised, O you being addressed, that God makes the night pass into the day and makes the day pass into the night, such that the increase of the one is relative to the decrease of the other, and He has disposed the sun and the moon, each, of the two, running, in its course, to an appointed term, namely, [to] the Day of Resurrection, and that God is Aware of what you do?",
  "That, which is mentioned, is [so] because God, He is the Truth, the established [truth], and whatever they call on (read yad\u0060na; or tad\u0060na, \u0060you call on\u0027) whatever they worship, besides Him is, evanescent, falsehood, and because God is the High [Exalted], above His creation by virtue of [His] subjugation [of them], the Great, the Mighty.",
  "Have you not seen that the ships run upon the sea by the grace of God, that He may show you, O you who are being addressed in this [statement], some of His signs? Surely in that there are signs, lessons, for every [servant who is] steadfast, [in abstaining] from acts of disobedience to God, grateful, for His grace.",
  "And if waves cover them, that is, [if] these rise above the disbelievers, like awnings, like mountains that act as awnings over those below them, they call on God, sincere before Him in their faith, that is, [in their] supplication, that He may deliver them, in other words, they do not call on any other [god] with Him; but when He delivers them to land, some of them compromise, middling between belief and disbelief, while others persist in their disbelief. And none denies Our signs, an example of which is Our delivering [them] from [such treacherous] waves, except every perfidious ingrate, [ungrateful] for God\u0027s graces, exalted be He.",
  "O people, namely, [such as] the people of Mecca, fear your Lord and fear a day when no parent shall avail a child, thereon in any way; and no child, thereon, shall avail its parent in any way. Surely God\u0027s promise, of resurrection, is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you, [and divert you] from Islam, and do not let the Deceiver, Satan, deceive you concerning God, because of His forbearance and granting [people] respite.",
  "Lo! God, with Him lies knowledge of the Hour, when it will come to pass; and He sends down (read yunzilu, or yunazzilu) the rain, at times which [only] He knows; and He knows what is in the wombs, whether it is a male or a female; and not one of the three things is known by anyone other than God, exalted be He. And no soul knows what it will earn tomorrow, of good or evil, but God, exalted be He, knows this; and no soul knows in what land it will die, but God, exalted be He, knows this.

  "And they say, to the believers: \u0060When will this [decisive] Judgement, between us and yourselves, be, if you are truthful?\u0027",
  "Say: \u0060On the day of [this] Judgement, [which will be effected] by sending the chastisement on them, their [newly found] faith [then] shall not benefit those who had been disbelievers, nor shall they be given respite, to make repentance or [offer] excuses.",
  "So turn away from them, and wait, for the chastisement to be sent down on them. They too are waiting, for your death to take place or [for you] to be killed and so be rid of you -- this was [revealed] before the command to fight them. Medinese; it consists of 73 verses, revealed after [srat] l \u0060Imrn.",
  "O Prophet! Fear God, remain in fear of Him, and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites, [and so follow them] in what contravenes your Law. Truly God is Knower, of what will happens before it happens, Wise, in what He creates.",
  "And follow what is revealed to you from your Lord, namely, the Qur\u0027n. Truly God is Aware of what you do (ta\u0060malna; a variant reading has ya\u0060malna, \u0060[what] they do\u0027).",
  "And put your trust in God, regarding this affair of yours; and God suffices as Guardian, to preserve you. And [the members of] his [the Prophet\u0027s] community are subject to the same [admonitions] in all of the above.",
  "God has not placed two hearts inside any man: [this was revealed] in order to refute those disbelievers who said that they each had two hearts with which they could reason better than Muhammad\u0027s single mind; nor has He made your wives whom (read as all\u0027, or all\u0027) you repudiate by zihr (read tazzahharna, or tuzhirna; the original t\u0027 [of tatazharna] has been assimilated with the z\u0027) -- a man would say to his wife for example, \u0060You are for me as [untouchable as] my mother\u0027s back\u0027 -- your mothers, in other words, [He has not made you wives] like [your] mothers, so that they are illicit [for conjugality] in that respect, [a practice] which in pre-Islamic times was considered a [valid form of] divorce. An atonement with [necessary] conditions is necessary in such a case, as mentioned in srat al-Mujdila [Q. 58:2-3]. Nor has He made those whom you claim as [adopted] sons (ad\u0060iy\u0027, the plural of da\u0060iyy, which is one claimed as the son of one who is not his [biological] father) your sons, in reality. That is a mere utterance of your mouths, namely, [of] the Jews and the hypocrites. When the Prophet (s) married Zaynab bt. Jahsh, who had been Zayd b. Hritha\u0027s wife, the adopted son of the Prophet (s), they said, \u0060Muhammad married his son\u0027s wife!\u0027, and so God proved them liars in this. But God speaks the truth, in this [matter], and He guides to the way, the way of truth.",
  "Instead, attribute them to their [true] fathers. That is more equitable, [that is] more just, in the sight of God. If you do not know their [true] fathers, then they are your brethren in religion and [as] your associates. And you would not be at fault for any mistake you make, in this respect, except, in, what your hearts may premeditate, after the prohibition [has been issued]. And God is Forgiving, of whatever you said before the prohibition [was issued], Merciful, to you in this respect.",
  "The Prophet is closer to the believers than their [own] souls, in terms of what he calls them to and what their own souls have called them to contravene, and his wives are their mothers, insofar as they [the believers] are forbidden to marry them. And those related by blood, kinsmen, are more entitled, to inherit [from], one another in the Book of God than the [other] believers and the Emigrants, in other words, than inheriting on account of [their sharing] faith and the Emigration, which had been the case at the beginning of Islam but was then abrogated; barring any favour you may do your friends, by [making] a bequest, which is permissible. This, namely, the abrogation of inheritance on account of [shared] faith and Emigration by the inheritance on account of kinship, is written in the Book -- in both instances al-kitb, \u0060the Book\u0027, denotes the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahfz).",
  "And, mention, when We took a pledge from the prophets, at the point when they were brought forth from the loins of Adam, the size of atoms, and from you, and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus son of Mary, that they worship [only] God and call others to worship Him (the mention of the five [names] is an instance of supplementing the specific to the general). And We took from them a solemn pledge, a solid [one], that they fulfil what they have been charged with, and this was [effected] by [swearing] an oath to God, after which the pledge was consummated;",
  "that He, God, may question the truthful about their truthfulness, in delivering the Message, as a way thereby to [justifiably] reproach the disbelievers; and He, exalted be He, has prepared for those who disbelieve, in them, a painful chastisement (\u0060adhban alman is a supplement to akhadhn, \u0060We took\u0027).",
  "O you who believe! Remember God\u0027s favour to you when hosts, of disbelievers, came against you, as confederates, at the time the Ditch (al-khandaq) was being dug, and We unleashed against them a [great] wind and hosts, of angels, you did not see. And God is ever Seer of what you do (read ta\u0060malna to imply \u0060in the way of [your] digging of the ditch\u0027; or read ya\u0060malna, \u0060[of what] they do\u0027, to imply \u0060the idolaters\u0027 forming of a confederation\u0027).",
  "When they came at you from above you and from below you, in other words, from the higher side of the valley and from its lower side, from the east and from the west, and when the eyes turned away [in fear], from everything, to [gaze at] their enemies [approaching] from every side, and the hearts lept to the throats (hanjir, the plural of hunjura, which lies at the bottom of the gullet) out of intense fear, while you entertained all sorts of, different, thoughts concerning God, [some] of assistance, some of despair;",
  "it was there that the believers were [sorely] tried, [there] they were tested, to distinguish the sincere individual from the one otherwise, and were shaken with a mighty shock, because of the severity of the terror.",
  "And, mention, when the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is sickness, namely, weakness of conviction, were saying, \u0060What God and His Messenger promised us, of assistance [to victory], was [nothing] but delusion\u0027, falsehood.",
  "And when a party of them, namely, the hypocrites, said, \u0060O people of Yathrib!, namely, the region of Medina (it [Yathriba] is a diptote because of its being a proper noun and because of the [morphological similarity it bears to a] verbal form) there is not a stand [possible] (read muqm or maqm) for you [here], in other words, no place to stay and no [strategic] position, so turn back, to your dwellings in Medina -- they had set out with the Prophet (s) towards the foot of a mountain outside Medina for battle. And a group of them [even] sought the permission of the Prophet, to turn back, saying, \u0060Our homes are exposed, unprotected and we fear for them\u0027. God, exalted be He, says: although they were not exposed. They only sought to flee, from battle.",
  "And had they been invaded in it, namely, Medina, from all sides and had they been exhorted, in other words, had the invaders exhorted them, to treachery, [a return to] idolatrous ways, they would have committed it (read la-tawh, or la-atawh, meaning, \u0060they would have offered it\u0027, or \u0060they would have committed it\u0027 [respectively]) and would have hesitated thereupon but a little.",
  "Though they had assuredly pledged to God before that, that they would not turn their backs [to flee]; and a pledge given to God must be answered for, regarding whether it was fulfilled [or not].",
  "Say: \u0060Flight will not avail you should you flee from death or [from] being slain, and then, if you were to flee, you would not be extended comfort, in this world, after you have fled, except a little\u0027, [except for] the remainder of your terms [of life]. 1756381685",
  "Say: \u0060Who is it that can protect you, grant you sanctuary, from God should He desire [to cause] you ill, [whether it be] destruction or defeat, or, [who is it that] can cause you ill, should He, God, desire for you mercy?\u0027, good. And they shall not find for themselves besides God, in other words, other than God, any protector, to avail them, or helper, to ward off harm from them.",
  "Indeed God already knows the hinderers among you and those who say to their brethren, \u0060Come to us\u0027, and they do not engage in the battle except a little, for show and for [the sake of their] reputation,",
  "grudging to you, in their help (ashihha, \u0060grudging\u0027, is the plural of shahh, and is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject [of the verb] ya\u0027tna, \u0060they engage\u0027). And when there is a panic, you see them looking at you, their eyes rolling like one, that is, like the look of one, or the rolling of one, fainting at death, in other words, [one] in the throes thereof; but when the panic subsides, and the spoils have been secured, they scald you, they hurt you, or they smite you, with [their] sharp tongues, in their greed for the riches, in other words, for the spoils, which they demand [greedily]. Those, they never believed, really. Therefore God has invalidated their works, and that, invalidation, is easy for God, by His will.",
  "They suppose that the confederates, of disbelievers, have not [yet] departed, to Mecca, because of their fear of them, and were the confederates to come, a second time, they would wish that they were in the desert with the Bedouins asking about your news, your encounters with the disbelievers. And if they were among you, this second time, they would fight but a little, for show and for fear of being reviled.",
  "Verily there is for you a good example (read iswa or uswa) in the Messenger of God, to emulate in combat and in holding one\u0027s ground [therein], for whoever (li-man substitutes for lakum, \u0060for you\u0027) hopes for [the encounter with] God, fears Him, and the Last Day, and remembers God often, in contrast to those who do not.",
  "And when the believers saw the confederates, of disbelievers, they said, \u0060This is what God and His Messenger promised us, in the way of trial and [assistance to] victory, and God and His Messenger were truthful\u0027, about the promise. And that only increased them in faith, in belief in God\u0027s promise, and submission, to His command.",
  "Among the believers are men who are true to the covenant they made with God, in steadfastly remaining alongside the Prophet (s). Some of them have fulfilled their vow, having died or been killed [fighting] for God\u0027s cause, and some are still awaiting, for this [fate], and they have not changed, [their commitment to] the covenant, in the least, and they stand in contrast to the situation with the hypocrites;",
  "that God may reward the truthful for their truthfulness and chastise the hypocrites, if He will, by causing them to die in [a state of] hypocrisy, or relent to them. Surely God is Forgiving, to he who repents, Merciful, to him.",
  "And God repulsed those who were disbelievers, namely, the confederates, in their rage, without their attaining any good, [without achieving] their desire in any way to triumph over the believers. And God spared the believers from fighting, by [unleashing] the wind and the angels. And truly God is Strong, in bringing about what He wants, Mighty, prevailing with His way.",
  "And He brought down those of the People of the Scripture, namely, the [Ban] Qurayza, who had supported them from their strongholds (says is the plural of ssa, and is that in which one fortifies himself [against an enemy]) and He cast terror into their hearts, [so that] some, of them, you slew, and these were the combatants, and some, of them, you took captive, namely, their children.",
  "And He made you inherit their land and their homes and their possessions, and a land you had not trodden, thitherto, and this was [the territory of] Khaybar, which was captured after [that of] Qurayza. And God has power over all things.",
  "O Prophet! Say to your wives: -- who were nine, and they had asked him for some of the adornments of this world, which he did not possess -- \u0060If you desire the life of this world and its adornment, come [now], I will provide for you, in other words, the compensation [to be provided] for divorce, and release you in a gracious manner, I will divorce you and will not coerce [you to stay].",
  "But if you desire God and His Messenger and the Abode of the Hereafter, namely, Paradise, then God has indeed prepared for the virtuous among you, [virtuous for] desiring the Hereafter, a great reward\u0027, namely, Paradise: so choose the Hereafter over [the life of] this world.",
  "O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you commits manifest indecency (read mubayyana, or mubayyina, meaning [respectively], \u0060it has become evident\u0027, meaning, \u0060one that is evident\u0027) the chastisement shall be doubled (yud\u0060af: a variant reading has [2nd form] yuda\u0060\u0060af, and still another has nuda\u0060\u0060if, \u0060We shall double\u0027, in which case [read] al-\u0060adhba, as accusative) for her, in other words, twice the chastisement for other women; and that is easy for God.",
  "But whoever of you is obedient to God and His Messenger, and acts righteously, We shall give her a twofold reward, in other words, twice the reward for other women (variant readings [for ta\u0060mal and nu\u0027tih] are [impersonal] ya\u0060mal, \u0060[whoever] acts\u0027, and yu\u0027tih, \u0060He will give her\u0027). And We have prepared a noble provision for her, in Paradise, in addition [to the twofold reward].",
  "O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other, group of, women. If you fear, God, for you are more exalted [in status], then do not be complaisant in your speech, with men, lest he in whose heart is a sickness, hypocrisy, aspire [to you], but speak honourable words, without any complaisance.",
  "And stay in your houses (read qirna or qarna, derived from al-qarr, and is actually, aqrirna or aqrarna from qarirtu or qarartu: the vowelling of the r\u0027 is moved to the qf and [the r\u0027] is omitted together with the conjunctive hamza) and do not flaunt your finery (tabarrajna, with one of the two original t\u0027 [of tatabarrajna] letters omitted) in the [flaunting] manner of the former Time of Ignorance, in other words, before Islam, when they used to display their beauty to men -- [the stipulation regarding] such \u0060displays\u0027 after [the coming of] Islam is mentioned in the verse: and not to display their adornment except what is apparent [Q. 24:31]. And maintain prayer and pay the alms, and obey God and His Messenger. Indeed God will but to rid you of sin, O, People of the House, in other words, [O] women of the Prophet (s), and to purify you, of it, with a thorough purification.",
  "And remember that which is recited in your houses of the revelations of God, [of] the Qur\u0027n, and wisdom, the Sunna. Truly God is Kind, to His friends, Aware, of all His creatures.",
  "Indeed the men who have submitted [to God] and the women who have submitted [to God], and the believing men and the believing women, and the obedient men and the obedient women, and the men who are truthful and the women who are truthful, in their faith, and the patient men and the patient women, [steadfast] in [performing] acts of obedience, and the humble men and the humble women, and the charitable men and the charitable women, and the men who fast and the women who fast, and the men who guard their private parts and the women who guard their private parts, from what is unlawful, and the men who remember God often and the women who remember God often -- for them God has prepared forgiveness, of [their] acts of disobedience, and a great reward, for their acts of obedience.",
  "And it is not [fitting] for any believing man or believing woman, when God and His Messenger have decided on a matter, to have (read takna or yakna) a choice in their matter, in contravention of the decision of God and His Messenger. This [verse] was revealed regarding \u0060Abd Allh b. Jahsh and his sister Zaynab, whose hand the Prophet had asked for in marriage, but meaning on behalf of Zayd b. Hritha. They were loathe to this [proposal] when they found out [that it was on the latter\u0027s behalf], for they had thought that the Prophet (s) wanted to marry her himself. But afterwards they consented because of the [following part of the] verse: And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger has certainly strayed into manifest error. Thus the Prophet (s) gave her in marriage to Zayd. Then on one occasion he [the Prophet] caught sight of her and felt love for her, whereafter [when he realised that] Zayd lost his affection for her and so said to the Prophet (s), \u0060I want to part with her\u0027. But the Prophet said to him, \u0060Retain your wife for yourself\u0027, as God, exalted be He, says:",
  "And when (idh is dependent because of [an implied preceding] udhkur, \u0060mention [when]\u0027) you said to him to whom God had shown favour, by [guiding him to] Islam, and to whom you [too] had shown favour: by manumitting him -- this was Zayd b. Hritha, who had been a prisoner of war before [the coming of] Islam (in the period of al-jhiliyya). The Messenger of God (s) purchased him before his call to prophethood, and then manumitted him and adopted him as his son -- \u0060Retain your wife for yourself and fear God\u0027, before divorcing her. But you had hidden in your heart what God was to disclose, [what] He was to manifest of your love for her and of [the fact] that should Zayd part with her you would marry her, and you feared people, would say, \u0060He has married his son\u0027s wife!\u0027, though God is worthier that you should fear Him, in all things, so take her in marriage and do not be concerned with what people say. Zayd subsequently divorced her and her [obligatory] waiting period was completed. God, exalted be He, says: So when Zayd had fulfilled whatever need he had of her, We joined her in marriage to you -- the Prophet consummated his marriage with her without [the customary] permission [from her legal guardian] and gratified the Muslims with [a feast of] bread and meat -- so that there may not be any restriction for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have fulfilled whatever wish they have of them. And God\u0027s commandment, that which He has decreed, is bound to be realised.",
  "There is no restriction for the Prophet in what God has ordained, [in what] He has made lawful, for him: [that is] God\u0027s precedent (sunnata\u0027Llhi is in the accusative because the operator of the oblique has been removed [from the oblique construction ka-sunnati\u0027Llhi, \u0060as is God\u0027s precedent\u0027) with those who passed away before, of prophets, which is that there is no restriction for them in this respect, a [special] dispensation for them regarding marriage -- and God\u0027s commandment, what He does, is inexorable destiny",
  "-- [those] who (alladhna qualifies the previous alladhna) deliver the Messages of God and fear Him, and fear no one except Him, and therefore they do not fear what people [might] say about that which God has made lawful for them. And God suffices as Reckoner, as keeper of the deeds of His creatures and [as One] to reckon with them.",
  "Muhammad is not the father of any man among you: he is not Zayd\u0027s biological father and so it is not unlawful for him to marry his [former] wife Zaynab [after him]; but, he is, the Messenger of God and the Seal of the Prophets, and so he will not have a son that is a [fully grown] man to be a prophet after him (a variant reading [for khtim al-nabiyyna] has khtam al-nabiyyn, as in the instrument [known as a] \u0060seal\u0027, in other words, their [prophethood] has been sealed by him). And God has knowledge of all things, among these is the fact that there will be no prophet after him, and even when the lord Jesus descends [at the end of days] he will rule according to his [Muhammad\u0027s] Law.",
  "O you who believe! Remember God with much remembrance.",
  "And glorify Him morning and evening, in other words, at the beginning of the day and at the end of it.",
  "It is He Who blesses you, that is to say, Who shows mercy to you, and His angels, ask forgiveness for you, that He may bring you forth, that He may always bring you forth, from darkness, namely, [from] disbelief, into light, namely, faith. And He is Merciful to the believers.",
  "Their greeting, from Him, exalted be He, on the day they encounter Him will be \u0060Peace\u0027, [extended to them] by the tongues of the angels. And He has prepared for them a noble reward, namely, Paradise.",
  "O Prophet! Indeed We have sent you as a witness, against those to whom you have were sent, and as a bearer of good tidings, for those who affirm your sincerity, of Paradise, and as a warner, for those who deny you, of the [punishment of the] Fire,",
  "and as a summoner to God, to obedience to Him, by His leave, by His command, and as a illuminating lamp, in other words, the equivalent of it, in terms of one\u0027s being able to find guidance therewith.",
  "And give good tidings to the believers that there will be for them a great bounty from God, namely, Paradise.",
  "And do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites, in [assenting to do] what contravenes your Law; and disregard, leave aside, their injuriousness -- do not retaliate against them for it until you receive a command [from God] regarding [how to deal with] them. And put your trust in God, for He will suffice you, and God suffices as Guardian, One to Whom matters are entrusted.",
  "O you who believe if you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them (read tamasshunna or tumshunna) that is, before you have copulated with them, there shall be no [waiting] period for you to reckon against them, [no] waiting period [needed to preclude pregnancy] or otherwise. But provide for them, give them what they can use for [securing] comforts, in cases where no dowry has been fixed for them; otherwise theirs is to retain half of what was fixed, but no more -- this is what Ibn \u0060Abbs said and it is [the opinion] followed by al-Shfi\u0060\u0027; and release them in a gracious manner, leave them be without [the intention to cause them any] harm.",
  "O Prophet! Indeed We have made lawful for you your wives whom you have given their dowries and what your right hand owns, of those whom God has given you as spoils of war, from the disbelievers, [whom you have] taken captive, such as Safiyya and Juwayriyya, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you, as opposed to those who did not emigrate, and any believing woman if she gift herself [in marriage] to the Prophet and if the Prophet desire to take her in marriage, and ask for her hand in marriage without paying [her] a dowry -- a privilege for you exclusively, not for the [rest of the] believers (nikh, \u0060marriage\u0027, when expressed by the term hiba, \u0060gift\u0027, denotes [marriage] without dowry). Indeed We know what We have imposed upon them, namely, the believers, with respect to their wives, in the way of rulings, to the effect that they should not take more than four wives and should only marry with [the consent of] a legal guardian, [the presence of] witnesses and [the payment of] a dowry, and, with respect to, what their right hands own, of slavegirls, in the way of purchase or otherwise, so that the handmaiden be one lawful for her master, such as a slavegirl belonging to the People of the Scripture (kitbiyya), and not a Magian or an idolater, and that she should be ascertained [as not carrying child] with the necessary waiting period (istibr\u0027) before copulation; so that (li-kayl is semantically connected to what came before [this last statement]) there may be no [unnecessary] restriction for you, [no] constraint in marriage [for you]. And God is Forgiving, of what is difficult to guard against, Merciful, in giving dispensations [allowing for latitude] in this respect.",
  "You may put off (read turji\u0027 or turj), you may postpone [consorting with], whomever of them you wish, namely, of your wives, from their turn [for intimacy], and consort, embrace [in conjugality], whomever you wish, of them, and come unto her, and as for whomever you may desire of those whom you have set aside, from their share, you would not be at fault, to desire her and consort with her [again]. He was given the choice in this respect after it had been obligatory for him to give each wife her [equal] share [of conjugality]. That, freedom of choice, makes it likelier that they will be comforted and not grieve, and that they will be satisfied with what you give them, of what has been mentioned of your freedom to choose [whom to consort with], every one of them (kulluhunna emphasises the subject of [the verb] yardayna, \u0060they will be satisfied\u0027) will be well-pleased with what you give her. And God knows what is in your hearts, with respect to [your] women and [your] preferring some [to others]. We have given you the freedom to choose [from among them] in order to make it easier for you to have what you desire. And God is Knower, of His creatures, Forbearing, in refraining from punishing them.",
  "Women are not lawful for you (read l tahillu, or l yahillu) beyond that, beyond the nine that have chosen you [as their husband], nor [is it lawful] for you to change (tabaddala: one of the two original t\u0027 letters [of tatabaddala] has been omitted) them for other wives, by divorcing them or some of them and marry in place of those whom you divorce, even though their beauty impress you, except those whom your right hand owns, of slavegirls, which is [in contrast] lawful for you. In addition to these [slavegirls] the Prophet (s) came to own Mriya [the Copt]. She bore for him Ibrhm, who died during his lifetime. And God is Watcher over, Preserver [of], all things.",
  "O you who believe, do not enter the Prophet\u0027s houses unless permission is granted you, to enter by invitation, to [share] a meal, and so you enter, without waiting for the [right] moment, [for] when it is ready (inhu, a verbal noun from an, ya\u0027n). But when you are invited, enter, and, when you have had your meal, disperse, without, lingering for, any [leisurely] conversation, amongst yourselves. Indeed that, lingering, is upsetting for the Prophet, and he is [too] shy of you, to make you leave, but God is not shy of the truth, that you should leave -- in other words, He would never refrain from declaring it (a variant reading [for yastahy] has yastah). And when you ask anything of [his] womenfolk, in other words, the wives of the Prophet (s), ask them from behind a screen, a curtain. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts, than [entertaining] sinful thoughts. And you should never cause the Messenger of God hurt, in any way; nor ever marry his wives after him. Assuredly that in God\u0027s sight would be very grave, as a sin.",
  "Whether you disclose anything or keep it hidden, regarding marrying them after him, truly God has knowledge of all things, and will requite you for it.",
  "They [the Prophet\u0027s wives] would not be at fault with regard to [socialising with] their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brothers\u0027 sons, or their sisters\u0027 sons, or their own, believing, women, or what their right hands own, of slavegirls or [male] servants, in seeing them or conversing with them without a screen. And fear [O women] God, in what you have been commanded. Surely God is Witness to all things, with nothing being hidden from Him.",
  "Indeed God and His angels bless the Prophet, Muhammad (s). O you who believe, invoke blessings on him and invoke peace upon him in a worthy manner, in other words, say: \u0060O God, bless our master Muhammad and grant him peace\u0027 (Allhumma sall \u0060al sayyidin Muhammad wa-sallim).",
  "Indeed those who are injurious to God and His Messenger -- and they are the disbelievers, who attribute to God what He is exalted above of such things as [His having] a son or a partner and they deny His Messenger -- God has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter, He has banished them [from His mercy], and has prepared for them a humiliating chastisement, and that is the Fire.",
  "And those who cause hurt to believing men and believing women without the latter\u0027s having done anything, [those who] accuse them of what they have not done, have verily borne [the guilt of] calumny, they have borne lies, and [the burden of] manifest sin.",
  "O Prophet! Tell your wives and daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks closely over themselves (jalbb is the plural of jilbb, which is a wrap that covers a woman totally) -- in other words, let them pull part of it [also] over their faces, leaving one eye [visible], when they need to leave [the house] for something. That makes it likelier that they will be known, to be free women, and not be molested, by being approached. In contrast, slavegirls did not use to cover their faces and so the disbelievers used to pester them. And God is Forgiving, of any occasion in the past when they may have neglected to cover themselves, Merciful, to them in His veiling them.",
  "If (la-in, the lm is for oaths) the hypocrites do not desist, from their hypocrisy, and likewise those in whose hearts is a sickness, [in their urge] to fornicate, as well as the scaremongers in the city, who alarm the believers by saying [to them things like], \u0060Your enemy is here and your raiding parties have been massacred!\u0027, or [they say to them], \u0060They have been defeated!\u0027. Assuredly We will urge you [to take action] against them, We will give you sway over them, then they will not be your neighbours, they will not dwell near you, in it except for a little [while], after which they will depart.",
  "Accursed, banished from mercy, [shall they be], wherever they are found they shall be seized and slain violently, that is to say, that is the ruling concerning them -- meant as a command [for the Prophet].",
  "God\u0027s precedent, in other words, God has made this His precedent [in dealing], with those who passed away before, with regard to the hypocrites of past communities who used to alarm believers with their scaremongery, and you will find that there is no changing God\u0027s precedent, [no changing of it] from Him.",
  "People, [such as] the people of Mecca, question you concerning the Hour: when will it be? Say: \u0060Knowledge thereof lies only with God -- and what do you know, [what would] provide you with knowledge thereof? In other words, you do not know it, perhaps the Hour is near\u0027.",
  "God has indeed cursed the disbelievers, He has banished them [from His mercy], and prepared for them a blaze, a violent fire into which they shall be admitted,",
  "to abide, their abiding having been foreordained, therein forever. They shall not find any protector, to preserve them from it, or helper, to ward it off from them.",

  "And they, namely, those who had been the followers [of the leaders of error], shall say, \u0060Our Lord, we obeyed our leaders (read [plural] sdatan, or sdtan, which is the plural of the plural) and elders, and they led us astray from the way, the path of guidance.",

  "O you who believe, do not behave, towards your Prophet, as did those who harmed Moses -- when they would say, for example, \u0060The only reason he does not wash with us is that he has an inflammation in his testicles\u0027 -- whereat God absolved him of what they alleged: when Moses placed his robe on a rock to go to wash, the rock hurtled away with it until it came to a halt amid a group of men from the Children of Israel. As Moses chased it and took his robe to cover himself, they saw that he had no such inflammation (udra is an inflammation of the testicle). And he was distinguished in God\u0027s sight. An instance of our Prophet (s) being subjected to hurt was when [on one occasion] while dividing up the spoils a man said to him, \u0060This is a division that I do not want to please God!\u0027, whereat the Prophet (s) became angered and said, \u0060May God have mercy upon Moses, for truly he was hurt with worse than this, but endured\u0027 -- reported by al-Bukhr.",

  "Indeed We offered the Trust -- [the obligation to] prayer and other matters which, when performed, result in reward and when neglected, result in punishment -- to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, and created in them the power of comprehension and speech [at the time of that offer], but they refused to bear it and were apprehensive of it; but man, Adam, undertook it, when it was offered to him.

  "Praise be to God -- God, exalted be He, praises Himself with these [words]; the import constitutes the eulogy that \u0060praise\u0027 is ever-established [for God] and it entails the attribution to Him of all that is beautiful, exalted be He -- to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, as possessions and creation. And to Him belongs [all] praise in the Hereafter, as in this world, for His friends praise Him as they enter Paradise. And He is the Wise, in what He does, the Aware, of His creatures.",

  "And those who disbelieve say, that is, some of them say to others in order to provoke disbelief [in them]: \u0060Shall we show you a man -- namely, Muhammad (s) -- who will inform you that when you have been utterly torn to pieces you shall indeed be created anew?\u0027",
  "Has he invented (read a\u0027ftar; the hamza, read with a fatha vowelling, is for the interrogative and suffices in place of the conjunctive hamza) a lie against God, in this [respect], or is there a madness in him, [does he suffer] a dementia on account of which he has imagined that? God, exalted be He, says: Nay, but those who do not believe in the Hereafter, that comprises resurrection and chastisement, will be in the chastisement, thereat, and in error that is far, from the truth, in this world.",
  "Have they not observed what is before them and what is behind them, in other words, what is above them and what is beneath them, of heaven and earth?

Surely in that, which is observed, there is a sign for every penitent servant, turning back to his Lord, [signs] indicating God\u0027s power to resurrect and to do what He will.",
  "And verily We bestowed on David a [great] favour from Us -- prophethood and scripture -- and We said: \u0060O mountains, repeat with him [in praise], by making glorifications, and the birds [too]!\u0027 (read wa\u0027l-tayra in the accusative as a supplement to the [syntactical] locus of jibl, \u0060mountains\u0027, in other words, and We also called on them to glorify [God] with him). And We made iron malleable for him, so that it was as dough in his hands.",
  "And We said: \u0060Fashion, from it, long coats of mail -- complete suits of armour which the person wearing it drags behind him along the ground -- and measure [well] the links\u0027, that is, in the weaving of the coats (the maker of these is called sarrd). In other words, make them so that the rings thereof are arranged properly. And act, O family of David, together with him, righteously. Indeed I am Seer of what you do, and will requite you for it accordingly.",
  "And, We disposed, for Solomon the wind (the nominative reading of al-rhu would be based on an implicit [missing verb] sakhkharn, \u0060We disposed\u0027) its morning course, meaning its journey from the morning to the noon, was a month\u0027s journey and its evening course, that is, its journey from the noon to sunset, was a month\u0027s journey. And We caused a fount of [molten] copper to flow for him, in other words, We caused the copper to melt for him, and so the fount flowed for three days and nights like water, and to this day people have been using of that [copper] which was given to Solomon [at that time]. And of the jinn [there] were those who worked before him by the leave, by the command, of his Lord. And such of them as deviated from Our command, to him to obey him [Solomon], We would make them taste the chastisement of the Blaze, the Fire in the Hereafter -- but it is also said, [that their chastisement was] in this world, in which case an angel would smite one of them with a lash thereof that would scorch him.",
  "They fashioned for him whatever he wished: lofty shrines (mahrb are high edifices which are ascended by stairs) and statues (tamthl is the plural of timthl, which is any thing which you fashion as a likeness [of another]), in other words, brass, crystal or marble figures -- the use of figures was not prohibited according to his Law; and basins (jifn is the plural of jafna) like cisterns (jawbin is the plural of jbiya, which is a large basin) -- around each \u0060basin\u0027 a thousand men would gather to eat -- and cauldrons built into the ground, fixed with foundations, and cannot be moved from their places: these were made from the [rocks of the] mountains of Yemen, and to which one ascended by climbing up a ladder. And We said: \u0060Work, O, House of David, in obedience to God, in thankfulness, to Him for what He has given you. And few indeed of My servants are thankful\u0027, labouring in obedience to Me in thanks for My favours.",
  "And when We decreed for him, for Solomon, death, in other words, [when] he died -- he remained supported against his staff an entire year, while the jinn continued to toil in hard labour as was customary, unaware of his death, until [finally] when a termite ate through his staff, he fell to the ground [and was seen to be] dead -- nothing indicated to them that he had died except a termite (al-ard is the verbal noun from uridat al-khashaba, passive verbal form, in other words, \u0060it [the piece of wood] was eaten away by a termite [al-arada]\u0027) that gnawed away at his staff (read minsa\u0027atahu or minstahu, replacing the hamza with an alif, meaning a \u0060staff\u0027, so called because [when describing it one would say] yunsa\u0027u bih, to mean it is used to repel or drive away [creatures]\u0027). And when he fell down, dead, the jinn realised, it became apparent to them, that (an, is softened, in other words, annahum) had they known the Unseen -- comprising what was hidden from them in the way of Solomon being dead -- they would not have continued in the humiliating chastisement, [in] that hard labour of theirs, [in which they continued] as they supposed him to be alive, which is in contrast to what they would have supposed had they known the Unseen and the fact that he had been there an entire year, judging by how much of the staff the termite had eaten through after his death; in other words, [they would not have continued in the humiliating chastisement] for a single day or even a single night [longer].",
  "Verily there was for Sheba (Saba\u0027, declined [as li-Saba\u0027in] or left as indeclinable [li-Saba\u0027a], is [the name of] a tribe that took its name from one of their Arab ancestors) in their dwelling-place, in Yemen, a sign: indicating God\u0027s power, exalted be He, two gardens (jannatn, a substitution [for yatun, \u0060a sign\u0027]) to the right and to the left, in other words, on the right side of their valley and on its left side. And it was said to them: \u0060Eat of your Lord\u0027s provision and give thanks to Him, for the graces He has bestowed on you in the land of Sheba. A good land -- in which there was no dung, gnats, flies, fleas, scorpions, or snakes, and in which when a stranger passed through with his clothes lice-infected, these [lice] would be killed off because of the purity of its air -- and, God is, a forgiving Lord.\u0027",
  "But they were disregardful, of giving thanks to Him and became disbelievers, so We unleashed upon them the flood of the Dam (al-\u0060arim is the plural of \u0060arima, which is a structure or something similar that holds water back [to be stored] for when it is needed), in other words, [We unleashed upon them] the flood- waters of their valley which had been held back by the mentioned [structure] so that they engulfed their two gardens together with all their property. And We gave them in place of their two gardens two gardens bearing (dhawtay, a dual form of [feminine plural] dhawt; usually [the form dhtay from] the singular [would have been used]) bitter fruit, bitter and vile (ukul may be read as a genitive annexation [ukulin khamtin] in the sense of \u0060that which is eaten [thereof being bitter]; or it may be read without [as ukuli khamtin]; and this [phrase] is supplemented [by the following, wa-athlin wa-shay\u0027in min sidrin qall) and tamarisk and sparse lote trees.",
  "That, replacement [of what they had], is what We requited them with for their ingratitude: and is anyone but the ingrate ever [so] requited? (read hal yujz ill\u0027l-kafru; or read as hal nujz ill\u0027l-kafra, \u0060Would We requite anyone but the ingrate?\u0027), in other words, it is only the like of such who is called to account.",
  "And We set between them, between Sheba, who were in Yemen, and the towns which We had blessed, with [abundance of] water and trees -- these being the towns of Syria, to which they used to travel for commerce -- prominent towns, continuous [along the route] from Yemen to Syria, and We facilitated [for travellers] the journeying through them, such that they would rest for the afternoon in one and spend the night in the next, [and so on] until the end of their travel, having no need of any supplies or water along the way; and We said, \u0060Travel through them night and day safely\u0027, having no fear by night or by day.",
  "But they said, \u0060Our Lord, make far apart (ba\u0060\u0060id: a variant reading has b\u0060id) the stages of our travel\u0027, to Syria: make these [stages through] deserts, so that they could glory before the poor in riding their camels and bearing their supplies and water, and so they behaved wantonly with the graces [bestowed on them by God], and they wronged their souls, through disbelief, and so We made them bywords, [of wrongdoing] in this respect, for those who came after them, and We caused them to disintegrate totally, We scattered them all over the lands. Surely in that, which is mentioned, there are signs, lessons, for every [servant who is] steadfast, [in refraining] from acts of disobedience, grateful, for [God\u0027s] graces.",
  "And verily Ibls proved true (read sadaqa or saddaqa) his opinion of them, that is, of the disbelievers among them -- [the folk of] Sheba -- which was that by his tempting them to go astray, they would follow him. So they followed him ([if the verb above is read] sadaqa, this would mean that \u0060he was right in his opinion\u0027, and [if read] saddaqa, it would mean that \u0060he found this [opinion of his] to be true\u0027) -- [all] except a group of the believers (mina\u0027l-mu\u0027minna, [the min, \u0060of\u0027] is explicative [not partitive], in other words, [all except that group] who were the believers: they did not follow him).",
  "And he did not have any warrant over them, any power to sway [them], from Us, but that We might know, by [this] knowledge being made manifest, him who believed in the Hereafter from him who was in doubt thereof, and so requite each of the two accordingly. And your Lord is Preserver, Watcher, of all things.",
  "Say, O Muhammad (s), to the disbelievers of Mecca: \u0060Call on those whom you have asserted, those whom you have asserted to be gods, besides God, in other words, other than Him, so that they might benefit you, as you are wont to assert. God, exalted be He, says of them: They do not possess [even] so much as the weight of an atom, of good or evil, in the heavens or in the earth, and they do not have any share in either of them, nor has He, exalted be He, among them, the gods, any auxiliary\u0027, [anyone required as His] helper.",
  "And intercession will not avail with Him, exalted be He -- this was in response to their saying that their gods would intercede [for them] with Him -- except for him to whom leave is given, in this respect (read adhina, \u0060[to whom] He gives leave\u0027; or udhina, \u0060[to whom] leave is given\u0027). Yet, when fear is banished from their hearts (read active fazza\u0060a, or passive fuzzi\u0060a), [when fear] is removed from them, upon leave being given for this [intercession], they will say -- some will say to others in anticipation of a favourable outcome -- \u0060What has your Lord said?\u0027, concerning this. They will say: [He has said] the saying that is, \u0060The truth\u0027, in other words, leave has been given for it. And He is the Exalted, above His creation, by [His] subjugation [of them], the Great, the Tremendous.",
  "Say: \u0060Who provides for you from the heavens, rain, and [from] the earth?\u0027, vegetation. Say: \u0060God!\u0027 -- [even] if they do not say it, there is no other [valid] answer. And indeed either we or you are -- in other words [either] one of the two parties [is] -- rightly guided or in manifest error. The ambiguity here [concerning which of the two is rightly guided] is intended as a gentle invitation for them to [embrace] faith if their way to it is facilitated [by God].",
  "Say: \u0060You will not be questioned about the sins we committed, nor shall we be questioned about what you do\u0027, for we are quit of you.",
  "Say: \u0060Our Lord will bring us together, on the Day of Resurrection, then He will judge between us with truth, and He will admit the truthful into Paradise and the liars into the Fire. And He is the Judge, the Knowing\u0027, in what He judges.",
  "Say: \u0060Show me, apprise me of, those whom you have joined to Him as associates, in worship. No indeed! -- [this is] meant to deter them from [even] supposing that He has an associate. Rather He is God, the Mighty, Whose way will prevail, the Wise\u0027, in the way in which He manages [the affairs of] His creation and so He could not have any associate in His kingdom.",
  "And We did not send you except to all (kffatan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-ns, \u0060mankind\u0027, and is made to precede [li\u0027l-ns] because of the importance attached to it) of mankind [both] as a bearer of good tidings, to believers, of Paradise, and a warner, to the disbelievers, of chastisement, but most people, such as the disbelievers of Mecca, do not know, this.",
  "And they say, \u0060When shall this promise, of chastisement, be [fulfilled], if you are being truthful?\u0027, concerning it.",
  "Say: \u0060Yours is the tryst of a Day which you can neither defer nor advance by a single hour\u0027, and this is the Day of Resurrection.",
  "And those who disbelieve, from among the people of Mecca, say, \u0060We will not believe in this Qur\u0027n, nor in that which was [revealed] before it\u0027 -- in other words, what preceded it, such as the Torah and the Gospel, both of which contain proofs of the Resurrection -- because they reject the truth of this [last]. God, exalted be He, says of them: But if you were to see, O Muhammad (s), when the evildoers, the disbelievers, are brought to stand before their Lord, bandying arguments against one another. Those who were oppressed -- the followers -- will say to those who were arrogant -- the leaders: \u0060Had it not been for you, barring us from faith, we would have been believers\u0027, in the Prophet.",
  "Those who were arrogant will say to those who were oppressed, \u0060Was it us who barred you from guidance after it had come to you?, Nay! Rather you were guilty\u0027, of your own accord.",
  "And those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, \u0060Nay, but [it was your] scheming night and day, in other words, [such were] your schemes against us during both [of these times], when you used to command us to disbelieve in God and set up partners with Him\u0027. And they, that is, the two parties, will conceal their remorse, for not having believed in Him, when they see the chastisement, in other words, each person will hide it [his remorse] from the next for fear of being reviled; and We will place fetters around the necks of the disbelievers, [while they are] in the Fire. Shall they be requited except, the requital, for what they used to do?, in the world.",
  "And We did not send a warner to any town without its affluent ones, its leaders, those enjoying [life\u0027s] comforts, saying, \u0060Indeed we disbelieve in that [Message] with which you have been sent\u0027.",
  "And they say, \u0060We possess more wealth and children, than those who are believers, and we shall not be chastised\u0027.",
  "Say: \u0060Truly my Lord extends provision, He makes it abundant, for whomever He will, as a test, and restricts [it], for whomever He will, to try [them], but most people, such as the disbelievers of Mecca, do not know\u0027, this [truth].",
  "Nor is it your wealth or your children that will bring you near to Us in closeness, except for, but [it is], those who believe and act righteously: those, they shall have a twofold reward for what they did, in other words, [they shall have it] as the reward of their action -- as a good deed, for example, is rewarded tenfold or more -- and they shall be in the lofty abodes, of Paradise, secure, from death and otherwise (a variant reading [for al-ghuruft] is al-ghurfa [the generic noun] implying a plural).",
  "And those who strive against Our signs, namely, the Qur\u0027n, [seeking] to invalidate it, supposing [Us] to be inomnipotent -- or [supposing] that they can elude Us -- those, they will be arraigned into the chastisement.",
  "Say: \u0060My Lord extends provision, He makes it abundant, for whomever He will of His servants, as a test, and restricts [it] for him, after having extended it -- or [He restricts it] for him whom He will to try, and whatever thing you may expend, for [the cause of] good, He will replace it. And He is the best of providers\u0027. It is said that every man \u0060provides for\u0027 his dependants (yarzuqu \u0060\u0027ilatahu), meaning that [he does so] from the provision given [to him] by God.",
  "And, mention, on the Day when He will gather them all together, namely, [all] the idolaters, He will say to the angels, \u0060Was it these who used to worship you?\u0027 (read a-h\u0027l\u0027i iyykum, pronouncing both hamzas, or by replacing the first with a y\u0027 or dropping it altogether).",
  "They will say, \u0060Glory be to You, exalted above that You should have an associate! You are our Supporter, not they, in other words, as far as we are concerned there are no bonds of association between us and them. Nay, (bal, is to indicate transition) rather, they used to worship the jinn, the devils, in other words, [they used to] obey them and [agree to] worship us; most of them were believers in them\u0027, accepting as truth what these [jinn] used to say to them.",
  "God, exalted be He, says: \u0060So today none among you has any power over another, in other words, none of those worshipped [have any power] over any of those who worshipped, either to benefit, [through] intercession, or to hurt\u0027, [through] chastisement. And We shall say to those who did wrong, who disbelieved: \u0060Taste the chastisement of the Fire which you used to deny!\u0027",
  "And when Our signs, [from] the Qur\u0027n, are recited to them, [being] clear signs, evident [ones], by the tongue of our Prophet Muhammad (s), they say, \u0060This is just a man who desires to bar you from [worshipping] what your fathers used to worship\u0027, of idols. And they say, \u0060This, Qur\u0027n, is nothing but a calumny, a lie, that has been invented, against God. And those who disbelieve say to the truth, the Qur\u0027n, when it comes to them, \u0060This is nothing but plain sorcery\u0027. God, exalted be He, says:",
  "And We did not give them any scriptures for them to study, nor did We send them any warner before you, so on what grounds do they deny you?",
  "And those who were before them [also] denied, and they, these ones [the Meccans], have not received [even] a tenth of what We gave those [others], in the way of might, long life and abundance of wealth. Yet they denied My messengers, [who were sent] to them, so how was My abhorrence! [so how was] My rebuttal against them through punishment and destruction, in other words, it was appropriate.",
  "Say: \u0060I will give you just one [piece of] admonition: namely, that you rise up for God, in other words, for His sake, in twos and individually, and then reflect: and realise [that], there is no madness in your companion, Muhammad (s). He is just a warner to you before [the befalling of] a severe chastisement\u0027, in the Hereafter, if you disobey him.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060I have not asked you, in return for [my] warning and delivering the Message [to you], any reward, since it is for [the benefit of] you, in other words, I do not ask you for any reward in return for this. Indeed my reward lies only with God, and He is Witness over all things\u0027, observing [them all], knowing my truthfulness.",
  "Say: \u0060Indeed my Lord hurls the truth, He casts it onto His prophets -- [He is] the Knower of the Unseen\u0027, [of] all that is hidden from His creatures throughout the heavens and the earth.",
  "Say: \u0060The truth, Islam, has come. And falsehood, disbelief, neither originates nor restores [anything]\u0027, in other words, it leaves no trace [of itself] behind.",
  "Say: \u0060If I go astray, from the truth, I will be going astray only to my own loss, that is to say, the sin of my going astray shall be held against me; and if I am rightly guided, it will have been by what my Lord reveals to me, of the Qur\u0027n and wisdom. Truly He is Hearer, of supplications, Nigh\u0027.",
  "If you could but see, O Muhammad (s), when they are stricken with terror, at the Resurrection, you would see a dreadful thing, and so there is no escape, for them, from Us, that is to say, they will not [be able to] elude Us, and they are seized from a close quarter, namely, [from] the graves.",
  "And they will say, \u0060We believe in him [now]\u0027, in other words, [in] Muhammad (s) -- or [if read \u0060We believe in it\u0027, then] in the Qur\u0027n. But how can they attain [it] (read tanwush or tan\u0027ush), that is, attain faith, from a place that is far away, from the place for [attaining] it -- as they are [now] in the Hereafter, and the [proper] place for [attaining] it was in this world --",
  "when they disbelieved in it before?, in this world. And they throw guesses at the Unseen from a far-off place, in other words, [they make guesses] about something the knowledge of which was hidden far away from them, as when they would say that the Prophet was a sorcerer, or a poet, or a soothsayer, or that the Qur\u0027n was sorcery, poetry or soothsaying.",
  "And a barrier is set between them and what they crave, in the way of faith -- in other words, [their craving] to embrace it -- just as was done with their counterparts, in [respect to] disbelief, formerly, in other words, before them. Indeed they used to be in grave doubt, [doubt] causing them to have misgivings about that in which they now believe, but the proofs for which they never considered in this world. Meccan: it consists of 45 or 46 verses, revealed after [srat] al-Furqn.",
  "Praise be to God, God praises Himself with in these [terms], as explained at the beginning of [the preceding] srat Saba\u0027, Originator of the heavens and the earth, the One Who created them without any precedent, Appointer of the angels as messengers, to [His] prophets, having wings in [sets of] two or three or four. He multiplies in creation, in angels and other [creatures], what He will. Surely God has power over all things.",
  "Whatever mercy God unfolds for mankind, in the way of provision or rain, none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds, thereof, none can release it after Him, that is, after His withholding it. And He is the Mighty, Whose way prevails, the Wise, in what He does.",
  "O people, that is, the people of Mecca, remember God\u0027s grace to you, in His making you dwell within the [Meccan] Sanctuary and preventing raids against you. Is there any creator (min khliqin: min is extra; khliq is the subject) other than God (read ghayru\u0027Llhi or gharyri\u0027Llhi, as an adjectival qualification of khliq, \u0060creator\u0027, either concording with the [oblique] form [of min khliqin] or concording with the syntactical status [thereof]; the predicate of the subject [is the following]) who provides for you from the heaven, rain, and, from the, earth?, vegetation (the interrogative is [actually] an affirmative, that is to say, \u0060there is no creator or provider other than Him). There is no god except Him. So how then do you deviate?, how are you turned away from affirming His Oneness when you already affirm that He is the Creator and the Provider?",
  "And if they deny you, O Muhammad (s), with regard to your coming with [the message of] God\u0027s Oneness, resurrection, reckoning and punishment, verily [other] messengers before you were denied, in this respect, so be steadfast as they were steadfast; and to God all matters are returned, in the Hereafter, when He will requite the deniers and grant victory to the messengers.",
  "O mankind! Indeed God\u0027s promise, of resurrection and of other issues, is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you, from believing in [all of] that, and do not let the Deceiver, Satan, deceive you concerning God, on account of His forbearance and respiting [of sinners in this life].",
  "Truly Satan is an enemy to you. So treat him as an enemy, by being obedient to God and do not obey him; he only summons his faction, his followers in disbelief, so that they may be among the inhabitants of the Blaze, the fierce Fire.",
  "Those who disbelieve, theirs will be a severe chastisement; but those who believe and perform righteous deeds, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward -- this is a declaration of what [fate] will be for the adherents of Satan and what will be for his opponents [respectively].",
  "The following was revealed regarding Ab Jahl and others: Is he, the evil of whose deeds is made [to seem] fair to him, by distortion, so that he deems it good [...]? (a-fa-man, \u0060is he [whose]\u0027 constitutes the subject, the predicate of which is [an omitted] \u0060like one whom God has guided?\u0027 No! And this [predicate] is indicated by [what follows]). Indeed God leads astray whomever He will and guides whomever He will. So do not let your soul expire for their sake, for those to whom it has made [to seem] fair, out of sighings, by becoming anguished lest they do not believe. Indeed God is Knower of what they do, and He will requite them for it.",
  "And it is God Who unleashes the winds (al-riyha: a variant reading has al-rha) and they raise clouds (fa- tuthru\u0027l-sahba: the imperfect tense here is used to narrate the past), that is, they stir them up, then We drive them (there is a shift here from the third person [to the first person] address) to a dead land (read mayyitin or maytin), wherein is no plant life, and therewith revive the earth, of that land, after it has been dead, [after] its having been dried-out. In other words, We made seeds and grass grow in it: Such will be the Raising, that is, the Resurrection and the bringing [of the dead] back to life.",
  "Whoever desires glory [should know that] all glory belongs to God, in this world and in the Hereafter, and it cannot be obtained from Him except through obedience to Him, so let such [a one] be obedient to Him. To Him ascends good words, that is to say, He is aware of such [good words], and these are [statements such as] \u0060there is no god except God\u0027 and the like; and as for righteous action, He exalts it, He accepts it; but those who plot evil, schemes against the Prophet -- [as was the case] at the council assembly, in the way of imprisoning him, killing him or expelling him, as mentioned in [srat] al-Anfl [Q. 8:30] -- theirs shall be a severe chastisement and their plotting shall come to nothing: it shall be ruined.",
  "And God created you from dust, by having created your father Adam from it, then from a drop of [seminal] fluid, in other words, from sperm, by creating his seed from it; then He made you pairs, males and females. And no female bears or brings forth except with His knowledge (ill bi-\u0060ilmihi is a circumstantial qualifier, in other words, \u0060[except] that it is known by Him\u0027) and no long-living person is given long life, in other words, the life of none is increased for one who has a long life, nor is anything diminished of his life, in other words, [of the life of] that same long-living person or some other long-living person, but it is [recorded] in a Book, namely, the Preserved Tablet. Surely that is easy for God.",
  "Nor are the two [kinds of] seas alike: this one is extremely sweet, pleasant to drink and that one is salty, extremely bitter. Yet from each, of the two, you eat fresh meat, namely, fish, and obtain, from the salt -- and it is also said, from both of them -- ornaments which you wear, namely, pearls and coral. And you see, you sight, the ships therein, in each of the two [seas], ploughing through (mawkhira, in other words, tamkhuru\u0027l-m\u0027a, meaning, \u0060it cleaves it as it makes its way through it, coming and going by the same wind) that you may seek of His bounty, exalted be He, through commerce, and that perhaps you may give thanks, to God for this [bounty].",
  "He, God, makes the night pass, enter, into the day, so that it becomes longer, and He makes the day pass into the night, so that it becomes longer, and He has disposed the sun and the moon, each, of them, moving, in its course, to an appointed term -- [to] the Day of Resurrection. That is God, your Lord; to Him belongs [all] sovereignty. As for those on whom you call, [whom] you worship, besides Him, in other words, other than Him -- and they are the idols -- they do not possess [even] so much as the husk of a date-stone.",
  "If you call on them, they will not hear your call, and [even] if they heard --hypothetically [speaking] -- they would not [be able to] respond to you; and on the Day of Resurrection they will disown your [idolatrous] associations, in other words, your associating them with God [in power], that is to say, they will declare themselves innocent of you and of your worship of them. And none can inform you, about the state in the two abodes, like One Who is Aware, Knower, and this is God, exalted be He.",
  "O mankind! You are the ones who are in need of God, in every state. And God, He is the Independent, [without any need] of His creatures, the Praised, the One Who is praised in whatever He does with them.",
  "If He will, He can take you away and bring about a new creation, instead of you.",
  "And that is not an arduous thing for God.",
  "And no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another [sinful soul]. And should one, soul, burdened heavily, with sin, call for, some of, its burden to be borne, by another, nothing of it will be borne, even if, the one called, be a relative, kin, such as a father or a son -- the impossibility of \u0060having something borne [by another]\u0027 in both instances is something ordained by God. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in secret, in other words, those who fear Him despite not having seen Him, for they are the ones to benefit from the warning, and observe the prayer, maintain [performance of] it. For whoever purifies himself, cleansing himself of idolatry and other [similar abominations], is purifying himself only for [the sake of] his own soul, because the reforming of his self pertains to him. And to God is the [end of the] journeying, the return in the Hereafter when He will requite according to deeds.",
  "Nor are the blind and the seer equal, that is, the disbeliever and the believer [are not equal],",
  "nor darkness -- disbelief -- and light -- faith;",
  "nor shade and torrid heat, namely, Paradise and the Fire;",
  "nor are the living equal to the dead, the believers and the disbelievers [respectively] (the addition of the particle l, \u0060nor\u0027, in all three instances is for emphasis). Indeed God makes to hear whomever He will, to be guided, so that such [a person] then responds to Him by embracing faith. But you cannot make those who are in the graves to hear, namely, the disbelievers -- whom He has likened to the dead -- [to hear] and so respond.",
  "You are but a warner, to them.",
  "Truly We have sent you with the truth, with [right] guidance, as a bearer of good tidings, to him who responds to it, and a warner, to him who does not respond to it. And there is not a community but there has passed, there has been, in it a warner, a prophet to warn it.",
  "And if they, that is, the people of Meccans, deny you, those before them also denied: their messengers brought them manifest signs, miracles, and with scriptures, such as the scrolls of Abraham, and with the illuminating Book, namely, the Torah and the Gospel, so endure [patiently] as they endured.",
  "Then I seized those who disbelieved, for their denial, and how was My abhorrence!, [how was] My rebuttal against them by way of punishment and destruction, in other words, it was appropriate.",
  "Have you not seen, [have you not] realised, that God sends down water from the heaven, wherewith We bring forth (there is here a shift from the third person [to the first person] address) fruits of diverse hues, such as green, red, and yellow [fruits] and so on? And in the mountains are streaks (judad is the plural of judda, which is a mountain trail or the like) white and red, and yellow, of diverse hues, some intense and some pale, and [others] pitch-black? (gharbbu sd is a supplement to judadun, \u0060streaks\u0027, meaning, dark- black rocks: one commonly says aswad ghirbb, but rarely ghirbb aswad).",
  "And of humans and beasts and cattle, there are diverse hues likewise, like the diversity of the [hues of] fruits and mountains. Indeed only those of God\u0027s servants who have knowledge fear Him, in contrast to the ignorant, such as the disbelievers of Mecca. Truly God is Mighty, in His kingdom, Forgiving, of the sins of His faithful servants.",
  "Indeed those who recite the Book of God and observe prayer, they maintain [performance of] it, and expend of what We have provided them secretly and openly, [to give] as alms and otherwise, anticipate a commerce that will never be ruined,",
  "that He may pay them in full their rewards, the reward for their mentioned deeds, and enrich them out of His bounty. Truly He is Forgiving, of their sins, Appreciative, of their obedience.",
  "And that which We have revealed to you of the Book, the Qur\u0027n, is the truth, confirming what was [revealed] before it, in other words, [confirming] the Books that came before it. Indeed, with regard to His servants, God is truly Aware and Seeing, knowing [both their] inward and outward aspects.",
  "Then We gave the Book, the Qur\u0027n, to those of Our servants whom We chose, namely, your community. Yet some of them are those who wrong themselves, by failing to act fully in accordance with it, and some of them are moderate, acting in accordance with it most of the time, and some are those who take the lead in [performing] good works, so that in addition to his [acquiring] knowledge he disseminates it and shows [others] the way [to proper conduct] as well as acting in accordance [with the Qur\u0027n], by the leave of God, by His will. That, bequest to them of the Book, is the greatest favour!",

  "And they will say, \u0060Praise be to God Who has removed, all, grief from us. Truly our Lord is Forgiving, of sins, Appreciative, of obedience,",
  "Who out of His favour has made us to dwell in the Abode of [everlasting] Stay, wherein no toil shall touch us, nor shall we be touched by any fatigue\u0027, lack of strength caused by exhaustion, [and this is] because [religious] obligations no longer apply therein (the second of these [\u0060fatigue\u0027], which is consequent upon the first [\u0060toil\u0027], is mentioned in order to make explicit the non-existence [of any toil in Paradise]).",
  "And as for those who disbelieve, there will be for them the fire of Hell: they will neither be done away with, through death, so that they may die, and find rest, nor will any [aspect] of its chastisement be lightened for them, [not even for] a single moment. In this way, in the way that We requite these, We requite every ingrate, [every] disbeliever (read yujz kullu kafrin, \u0060every ingrate is [so] requited\u0027; or najz kulla kafrin, \u0060[so] We requite every ingrate\u0027).",

And [moreover] the warner, the Messenger, came to you, but you did not respond to his call, so taste now [this chastisement]!

  "It is He Who made you successors in the earth (khal\u0027if, \u0060successors\u0027, is the plural of khalfa) in other words, one succeeding the other. So whoever disbelieves, of you, his disbelief will be to his own detriment, that is, the evil consequences of his disbelief [will be so]. And their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers with their Lord [in anything] except disfavour, wrath. And their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers [in anything] except loss, of [the reward of] the Hereafter.",

Show me, apprise me of, what [part] of the earth they have created. Or do they have some partnership, some share alongside God, in, the creation of, the heavens?\u0027 Or have We given them a scripture, so that they are [acting] upon a clear proof, a definitive argument, therefrom?, to the effect that they have some partnership with Me? Nothing of the sort! Nay, but the evildoers, the disbelievers, promise one another nothing but delusion, falsehood, when they say that the idols will intercede for them.",
  "Truly God sustains the heavens and the earth lest they disappear, in other words, He prevents them from disappearing. And if (wa-la-in: the lm is for oaths) they were to disappear there is none that can sustain them after Him, in other words, other than Him. Truly He is ever Forbearing, Forgiving, in deferring the punishment of the disbelievers.",
  "And they, that is, the disbelievers of Mecca, swore by God their most solemn oaths, [they swore] with utmost effort [to be sincere] in them, that if a warner, a messenger, were to come to them, they would be more readily guided than any one of the communities, [than] the Jews, the Christians or others, in other words, [more readily guided] than any one of these -- having [themselves] seen the extent to which these [groups] called each other liars, given that: The Jews say, \u0060The Christians stand on nothing\u0027, and the Christians say, \u0060The Jews stand on nothing\u0027, [Q. 2:113]. But when a warner, namely, Muhammad (s), did come to them, this, coming of his, only increased them in aversion, further away from [right] guidance,",

So do they expect, do they await, anything but the precedent of the ancients?, God\u0027s way [of dealing] with them, such as chastising them for their denial of the messengers? Yet you will never find any change in God\u0027s precedent, and you will never find any revision in God\u0027s precedent, that is to say, chastisement is never replaced by anything else, nor is it ever meted out other than to the one who deserves it.",
  "Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them -- and they were mightier than these in power?, but [still] God destroyed them for their denial of the messengers.

And when their term comes -- then truly [they will know that] God is ever Seer of His servants, and so He will requite them according to [the nature of] their deeds, rewarding the believers and punishing the disbelievers.

  "who used to say, to me in reproach, \u0022Are you really among those who affirm as truth, the Resurrection [and],",
  "[that] when we are dead and have become dust and bones, we shall actually be called to account?\u0022 \u0027, that we shall be requited and reckoned with -- he rejects [the truth of] this as well (as regards all three instances of the hamzas [sc. a-innaka, a-idh, and a-inn] what has been mentioned above [applies]).",
  "He, the one speaking, says, to his brethren [in Paradise], \u0060Will you have a look?\u0027, together with me into the Fire, to see his condition -- but they will say, \u0060No\u0027.",
  "Then he, that speaker, will take a look, through one of the apertures in Paradise, and he will catch sight of him, that is, he will see his comrade, in the centre of Hell, in the middle of the Fire.",
  "He will say, to him, acknowledging that he [the latter] deserves his fate: \u0060By God! You very nearly destroyed me, you [almost] ruined me through your misguidance (in, this has been softened from the hardened form [inna]).",
  "And had it not been for the favour of my Lord, His grace to me in giving me faith, I [too] would have been of those arraigned\u0027, with you, in the Fire. The inhabitants of Paradise will say:",
  "Do we then not die [anymore],",
  "aside from our first death, that is, the one [which we suffered] in this world, and are we not to be chastised?\u0027 -- this interrogative statement is one made out of [sheer] delight and in order to speak [at length] of the graces of God, exalted be He, in [His] granting of everlasting life and refraining from inflicting any punishment.",
  "Truly this, that has mentioned [as being the reward] for the inhabitants of Paradise, is indeed the mighty success.",
  "For the like of this let [all] the workers work -- it is said that this is said to them, or it is what they say [themselves].",
  "Is that, which is mentioned to them, a better hospitality (nuzul, denotes what is prepared for one who is being received as a guest and so forth) or the Zaqqm tree, that is prepared for the inhabitants of the Fire -- it is the vilest and most bitter tree of the Tihma region, which God causes to grow in the Fire, as will be stated shortly.",
  "We have indeed made it, for that reason [sc. its being a tree in the Fire], a trial for the wrongdoers?, namely, [for] the disbelievers of Mecca, for they said, \u0060Fire consumes trees so how can it make them grow forth?\u0027",
  "Indeed it is a tree that comes forth from the very source of Hell, in other words, from the depths of Hell, with its branches extending up through all its [different] levels.",
  "Its spathes, likened to the spathes of a date-palm, are like the heads of devils, [as] vile-looking snakes.",
  "And indeed they, the disbelievers, will eat of it, despite its vileness, because of the severity of their hunger, and will fill their bellies from it.",
  "Then, lo!, on top of it they will have a brew of boiling water, which they drink and which mixes with what they have eaten and becomes a brew thereof.",
  "Then indeed their return shall be to Hell-fire -- this suggests that they exit from it [only] to drink the boiling water, which is located outside it.",
  "Lo! they found their fathers to be astray,",
  "and so they are [also now] hurrying in their footsteps: they shall be prodded to follow them and they end up hurrying towards it [Hell-fire].",
  "And verily most of the ancients, of past communities, went astray before them,",
  "and We certainly had sent among them warners, in the way of messengers to threaten [them].",
  "So behold how was the consequence for them who were warned, namely, the disbelievers: in other words the sequel for them was [that they ended up in] the chastisement;",
  "[all] except God\u0027s sincere servants, namely, the believers, who are saved from chastisement because they were sincere in their worship (mukhlisna); or (if one reads mukhlasna) because God has made them sincerely devoted to such [worship].",
  "And verily Noah called to Us, when he said, \u0060My Lord: I have been overcome, so help [me] [Q. 54:10], and how excellent were the Hearers of the prayer, for him, were We: in other words he invoked Us against his people, so We destroyed them by drowning [them].",
  "And We delivered him and his family from the great distress, which was the drowning,",
  "and made his descendants the survivors, thus all human beings are descended from him, peace be upon him. He had three sons: Shem (Sm), the ancestor of the Arabs, the Persians and the Byzantines; Ham (Hm), the ancestor of the Negroes; and Japheth (Yfith), the ancestor of the Turks, the Khazar and [the peoples of] Gog and Magog and [the inhabitants of] such regions.",
  "And We left, We preserved, for him, fair praise, among posterity: [among] the prophets and communities [after him] until the Day of Resurrection [which is]:",
  "\u0060Peace, from Us, be to Noah among the worlds!\u0027",
  "Thus indeed, in the way that We requited them, We requite the virtuous.",
  "He was indeed one of Our faithful servants.",
  "Then We did drown the others, the disbelievers from among his folk.",
  "And truly of his adherents, that is, of those who agreed with him on the fundaments of religion, was Abraham, despite the fact that there was a long interval between them, 2640 years, and between them came [the prophets] Hd and Slih.",
  "When he came to his Lord, in other words, he continued to follow Him upon coming to Him, with a heart that was pure, of any doubt or the like,",
  "when he said, [while still] in this continuous state of his, to his father and his folk, in reproach: \u0060What do -- what is it that -- you worship?",
  "Is it a calumny (a-ifkan, as regards the two hamzas, the same applies as mentioned before) -- gods other than God -- that you desire? (ifkan is an object denoting reason; lihatan is the direct object of turdna, \u0060you desire\u0027; ifk denotes the worst kind of lie). In other words: do you worship [any] other than God?",
  "What then is your supposition regarding the Lord of the Worlds?\u0027, having worshipped other than Him, [do you think] that He will leave you without punishment? No! They were a people of astrologers. On one occasion, they went out to celebrate a festival of theirs and left their food behind with their idols, claiming that they were securing thereby blessings for it and that they would eat it upon their return. They had said to the lord Abraham: \u0060Come out with us\u0027.",
  "And he cast a glance at the stars -- to delude them into thinking that he relies on them, so that they would then trust him --",
  "and said, \u0060Indeed I feel [I will be] sick\u0027, that is, I will fall ill.",
  "So they went away, to their festival, leaving him behind.",
  "Then he turned, he stole away, to their gods, the idols, in front of which the food had been placed, and said, mockingly: \u0060Will you not eat? -- but they failed to utter [a word].",
  "He then said: What is wrong with you that you do not speak?\u0027 -- but [still] he received no response.",
  "He then turned on them striking [them] with his right hand, with might, smashing them. Those who saw him reported this to [the rest of] his people.",
  "So they came running towards him, walking hurriedly, and they said to him, \u0060We worship them while you smash them?!\u0027",
  "He said, to them in reproach: \u0060Do you worship what you [yourselves] have carved, out of stone and other materials, idols,",
  "when God created you and whatever you make?\u0027, [whether it be] your act of carving and that which you have carved? So worship Him alone! (the m [in wa-m ta\u0060malna, \u0060and whatever you make\u0027] is that of the verbal noun; but it is also said to introduce a relative clause, or it is adjectivally qualified).",
  "They said, amongst themselves: \u0060Build for him a structure, then fill it with firewood and set it on fire, and when it is ablaze, then cast him into the fierce fire\u0027.",
  "So they sought to outwit him, by flinging him into the fire, so that it may destroy him, but We made them the lowermost, the vanquished, as he came out of the fire unharmed.",
  "And he said, \u0060I shall indeed depart to my Lord, I shall emigrating to Him from the abode of disbelief -- He will guide me, to the place to which My Lord has commanded that I end up in, and this was Syria. When he reached the Holy Land, he said:",
  "My Lord! Grant me, a child, of the righteous\u0027.",
  "So We gave him the good tidings of a forbearing son.",
  "And when he was old enough to walk with him, that is, to go about with him and help him out -- this is said to have been [either] at the age of seven or at the age of thirteen -- he said, \u0060O my dear son, I see, that is, I have seen, in a dream that I shall sacrifice you -- and the visions of prophets are [always] true and their actions are [inspired] by the command of God, exalted be He. So see what you think\u0027, of this dream. He consulted him so that he [his son] might accept the idea of being sacrificed and comply with the command for it. He said, \u0060O my father (the [final] t\u0027 [in abati] replaces the y\u0027 of the genitive [possessive] annexation [y ab]) do whatever you have been commanded, to do. You shall find me, God willing, of the steadfast\u0027, in this [affair].",
  "And when they had both submitted, [when] they had submitted to and were prepared to comply with God\u0027s command, exalted be He, and he had laid him down on his forehead, [when] he had pushed him down to the ground thereon -- every human being has two brows (jabn) between which is the forehead (jabha); this was at Min. Abraham passed the knife across his [son\u0027s] throat but it did not do anything, by some impediment of the Divine Power,",
  "We called to him, \u0060O Abraham!",
  "Verily you have fulfilled the vision\u0027, by what you have done, in that you were able to go through with the act of sacrifice. In other words, that [which you have done] suffices for you [as redemption] (the statement ndaynhu, \u0060We called to him\u0027, is the response to the lamm, \u0060when\u0027, so that the ww [in wa-ndaynhu, \u0060We called to him\u0027] is extra). So, in the same way that We have rewarded you, do We reward those who are virtuous, to their own souls in obeying the Command [of God], by removing from them their distress.",
  "Truly this, sacrifice to which he was commanded, was indeed a clear test\u0027, that is to say, the ultimate test [of faith].",
  "Then We ransomed him, the one whom he had been commanded to sacrifice, namely, Ishmael or Isaac -- two different opinions -- with a mighty sacrifice, [a mighty] ram from Paradise, the same one that Abel had offered as as sacrifice: Gabriel, peace be upon him, brought it and the lord Abraham sacrificed it as he cried, Allhu akbar, \u0060God is Great\u0027.",
  "And We left, We preserved, for him among posterity, fair praise [namely]:",
  "\u0060Peace, from Us, be to Abraham!\u0027",
  "So, in way that We rewarded him, do We reward those who are virtuous, to their own souls.",
  "Indeed he is one of Our faithful servants.",
  "And We gave him the good tidings of [the birth of] Isaac -- some have argued that this proves that the one who was sacrificed was not him [Isaac] -- a prophet (nabiyyan is a future circumstantial qualifier, that is to say, \u0060he will come to be, with his prophethood decreed), one of the righteous.",
  "And We blessed him, by multiplying his descendants, and Isaac, his son, [We also blessed] by appointing the majority of prophets from among his progeny. And among their descendants is he who is virtuous, [he who is] a believer, and he who plainly wrongs his soul, [he who is] a disbeliever, whose disbelief is manifest.",
  "And verily We favoured Moses and Aaron, with prophethood,",
  "and We delivered them and their people, the Children of Israel, from the great distress, namely, Pharaoh\u0027s enslavement of them.",
  "And We helped them, against the Egyptians, so that they became the victors.",
  "And We gave them the enlightening scripture, the one whose statements concerning prescribed punishments and rulings and otherwise are excellently expressed -- this is the Torah.",
  "And We guided them to the straight path, [the straight] way,",
  "and We left, We preserved, for them among posterity, fair praise [namely]:",
  "\u0060Peace, from Us, be to Moses and Aaron!\u0027",
  "So, just as We rewarded them both, do We reward the virtuous.",
  "Indeed both were among Our faithful servants.",
  "And truly Elias (read [wa-inna Ilys] with the initial hamza or without [wa-inna\u0027l-ysa) was [also] one of the messengers. Some think that this [Elias] was the son of Aaron\u0027s brother -- [Aaron] the brother of Moses; but some say that this [Elias] was some other [person], who was sent to the people living in and around Baalbak.",
  "When (idh is dependent because of an implicit [verb] udhkur, \u0060mention\u0027) he said to his people, \u0060Will you not fear [God]?",
  "Do you call on Baal -- this was the name of an idol of theirs which was made of gold, from which the name of their city derives, with the addition of [the suffix] bak -- that is to say, do you worship him, and abandon the Best of Creators, and not worship Him,",
  "God, your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers?\u0027 (read [as predicates] allhu, rabbukum and rabbu, in the nominative, because of the [implicit] omitted huwa [being the subject]; or read allha, rabbakum and rabba, in the accusative, as supplements to ahsana, \u0060the best of\u0027).",
  "But they denied him. So they will indeed be arraigned, in the Fire,",
  "-- [all] except God\u0027s delivered servants, namely, the believers, who will be saved from it,",
  "and We left for him among posterity, fair praise [namely]:",
  "\u0060Peace, from Us, be to Elias!\u0027. It is said that this [ilysn] is [the same] Elias mentioned above; but it is also said that this denotes him together with [all] those who were believers with him, and so they have been coupled [under the same term] with him being the predominant, as when one might say al-Muhallabn, \u0060the Muhallabids\u0027, to mean al-Muhallab and his folk; a variant reading has l ysn, by which is meant his family as well as Elias himself.",
  "Indeed so -- just as We rewarded him -- do We reward the virtuous.",
  "Truly he is one of Our faithful servants.",
  "And indeed Lot was one of the messengers;",
  "mention, when We delivered him together with all his family,",
  "except an old woman [who was] among those who stayed behind, in other words, those who stayed behind in the chastisement.",
  "Then We destroyed [all] the others, the disbelievers from among his people.",
  "And indeed you pass by them, by their remains and [the remains of] their dwellings during your travels, [both] in the morning, that is, during the daytime,",
  "and at night: will you, O people of Mecca, not then understand?, what befell them and so take heed therefrom?",
  "And indeed Jonah was one of the messengers;",
  "when he fled to the laden ship -- after he became furious with his people, as the chastisement which he had promised them did not come down on them; so he boarded the ship, which then stopped out in the deep sea. The seamen said, \u0060There is a runaway slave here [upon this ship] who has fled from his master: a casting of lots should expose him!\u0027",
  "Then he drew lots, with the passengers on the ship, and was of those rejected, of the losers in the draw and so they threw him into the sea.",
  "Then the whale swallowed him while he was blameworthy, that is, while he was guilty of a blameworthy thing, having gone to sea and embarked the ship without his Lord\u0027s permission.",
  "And had he not been one of those who glorify [God], that is to say, those who make remembrance [of God], for inside the whale\u0027s belly he was repeatedly saying [the words] \u0060There is no god except You. Glory be to You! I have indeed been one of the wrongdoers\u0027 [Q. 21:87],",
  "he would have tarried in its belly until the day when they are raised, in other words, the whale\u0027s belly would have been his tomb until the Day of Resurrection.",
  "Then We cast him, We flung him out of the belly of the whale, onto the barren land, onto the face of the earth, that is, onto the shore on that same day -- or three, or seven, or twenty, or forty days later -- and he was sick, ailing like a [newly-born] featherless chick.",
  "And We made a gourd plant to grow above him, to provide shade for him with its stem, which is not the case usually with gourds, as a miracle for him; a mountain goat would come to him in the morning and in the evening and he would drink its milk, until he finally regained his strength.",
  "And We sent him, afterwards -- as [We had done] before, to a people in Nineveh, in the region of Mosul -- to a [community of a] hundred thousand or, in fact, more -- [a community of] twenty, thirty or seventy thousand.",
  "And they believed, after they saw [with their own eyes] the chastisement which they had been promised. So We gave them comfort, We kept them alive to enjoy their wealth, for a while, until their terms [of life] would be concluded [while they took comfort] therein.",
  "So ask them, inquire of the Meccan disbelievers, by way of reproach: are daughters to be for your Lord, after their claim that the angels were God\u0027s daughters, while sons are to be for them?, so that the best becomes exclusively theirs?",
  "Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses?, to Our [act of] creation, that they might then say such a thing?",
  "Lo! it is indeed out of their [own] mendacity, their [own] lies, that they say,",
  "\u0060God has begotten\u0027, when they say that the angels are God\u0027s daughters. And verily they are liars, in this [respect].",
  "Has He preferred daughters to sons? (read a\u0027staf, \u0060has He preferred\u0027, indicating an interrogative [hamza], which stands in place of the omitted conjunctive hamza).",
  "What is wrong with you? How do you judge?, [how do you make] such a depraved judgement?",
  "Will you not then remember? (tadhakkarna: the t\u0027 [of tatadhakkarna] has been assimilated with the dhl), that He, glory be to Him, is exalted above having a child?",
  "Or do you have a clear warrant?, plain definitive proof that God has a child?",
  "Then produce your scripture, the Torah, and show Me this [as it is mentioned] in it, if you are being truthful, about this statement of yours.",
  "And they, namely, the idolaters, have set up between Him, exalted be He, and the jinn, namely, the angels (jinna: they are so called because they are hidden [ijtinn] from vision) a kinship, by saying that they are God\u0027s daughters, while the jinn certainly know that they, that is, those who say this, shall indeed be arraigned, into the Fire, to be chastised therein.",
  "Glory be to God, affirming that He is exalted, above what they attribute, [to Him] in the way of His having a child,",
  "-- [all] except God\u0027s devoted servants, namely, believers (the exceptive clause here is discontinuous) in other words, [that is] because they declare that God transcends what such individuals attribute [to Him].",
  "For indeed you and what you worship, of idols,",
  "-- you cannot tempt, anyone, thereto, that is, to [incline to] your [worshipped] idols (\u0060alayhi, \u0060thereto\u0027, is semantically connected to His saying [bi-ftinna], \u0060you cannot tempt\u0027),",
  "except him who will burn in Hell, in God\u0027s knowledge, exalted be He.",
  "Gabriel said to the Prophet (s): And there is not one of us, [us] the company of angels, but has a known station, in the heavens, in which he worships God and which he does not transgress.",
  "And indeed it is we who are the rangers, of our feet in prayer.",
  "And indeed it is we who give glory, [it is we] who declare that God transcends what does not befit Him.",
  "And indeed (in, is softened in place of the hardened one) they, the Meccan disbelievers, used to say,",
  "\u0060If we had but a reminder, a scripture, from the ancients, that is, from among the scriptures of past communities,",
  "we would have surely been God\u0027s devoted servants\u0027, [devoting] worship purely to Him.",
  "God, exalted be He, says: Yet they disbelieved in it, in other words, in the Book that came to them, namely, the Qur\u0027n, more glorious than [all] those other scriptures; but they will come to know, the consequences of their disbelief.",
  "And verily Our Word, [containing the promise] of victory, has gone beforehand in favour of Our servants, the messengers: and that [Word] is, I shall assuredly prevail, I and My messengers [Q. 58:21] --",
  "or it is His [following] saying -- assuredly they shall be helped,",
  "and assuredly Our hosts, namely, the believers, they will indeed be the victors, over the disbelievers by [their being given] the definitive proofs and assistance against them in this world. And if some of these [believers] are not victorious over them in this world, then assuredly in the Hereafter [they will be so].",
  "So leave them, in other words, shun the Meccan disbelievers, for a while, until [such time as] you are commanded to fight them;",
  "and watch them, when the chastisement is sent down on them; for they will [soon] see, the consequences of their disbelief.",
  "They then said in mockery, \u0060When will this chastisement be sent down?\u0027 God, exalted be He, threatens them by saying: Do they seek to hasten Our chastisement?",
  "But when it descends in their courtyard -- al-Farr\u0027 said that the Arabs find it sufficient to refer to a people by referring to \u0060their courtyard\u0027 -- how awful, how terrible a morning, will be the morning for those who were warned (the overt noun [al-mundharn] has replaced the [third person] pronominalisation [in shatihim]).",
  "So leave them for a while,",
  "and watch; for they will [soon] see -- this [statement] is repeated in order to emphasise the threat made to them and to reassure the Prophet (s).",
  "Glory be to your Lord, the Lord of Might, of Triumph, [exalted is He] above what they allege!, in the way of His having a child.",
  "And peace be to the messengers, who convey from God the Message of the Oneness [of God] and [His] Laws.",
  "And praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds, for granting these [messengers] victory and destroying the disbelievers. Meccan: it consists of 86 or 88 verses, revealed after [srat] al-Qamar.",
  "Sd: God knows best what He means by this [letter]. By the Qur\u0027n bearing the Remembrance, that is, [bearing] the Pronouncement; or [what is meant is that the Qur\u0027n is a Book] of renown (the response to this oath has been omitted, in other words: \u0060It is not as the Meccan disbelievers say, that there are many gods\u0027).",
  "Nay, but those who disbelieve, from among the people of Mecca, dwell in conceit, in self-glory and [in] disdain of faith, and defiance, disagreement with, and enmity towards, the Prophet (s).",
  "How many -- in other words, many -- a generation, a community of past communities, We have destroyed before them, and they cried out, when the chastisement was sent down on them, when it was no longer the time for escape, that is to say, the time was not one for fleeing (the [suffixed] t\u0027 [of wa-lta] is extra; the sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of [the verb] ndaw, \u0060they cried out\u0027) in other words, they called for help but the situation was such that there could be no escape or deliverance; but still the Meccan disbelievers have not taken heed from their example.",
  "And they marvel that a warner has come to them from among themselves, a messenger from among their number, to warn them and to threaten them with [the punishment of] the Fire after resurrection -- and this [warner] is the Prophet (s). And those who disbelieve (the overt noun [al-kfirn] has replaced the [third person] pronominalisation) say, \u0060This is a sorcerer, a liar.",
  "Has he made the gods One God? -- for he had said to them, \u0060Say: there is no god except God\u0027 -- in other words [they objected]: how could one god suffice for all of creation? Lo! that is indeed a curious thing\u0027.",
  "And the council from among them go about, from the place of their assembly at the house of Ab Tlib and [the place] where they heard the Prophet (s) say, \u0060Say: there is no god except God\u0027, saying, \u0060Go!, they say to one another, go, and stand by your gods, adhere firmly to worship of them; lo! this, that has been mentioned concerning the Oneness of God, is indeed a thing sought, from us.",
  "We never heard of this in the latter-day creed, namely, the creed of Jesus. This is surely [nothing] but an invention, [mere] lies.",
  "Has the Remembrance, the Qur\u0027n, been revealed to him, Muhammad (s), out of [all of] us\u0027, when he is neither the elder nor the noblest among us? In other words, it could not have been revealed to him (read a- unzila pronouncing both hamzas, or not pronouncing the second one, but in both cases inserting an intervening alif or without [this insertion]). God, exalted be He, says: Nay, but they are in doubt concerning My Remembrance, My revelation, that is, the Qur\u0027n, for they deny the one who has brought it. Nay, but they have not yet tasted My chastisement, and if they were to taste it, they would certainly believe the Prophet (s) in what he has brought -- but then [in such a case] their belief [in the Prophet] would be of no benefit to them.",
  "Or do they possess the treasuries of your Lord\u0027s mercy, the Mighty, the Victor, the Bestower?, [treasuries] such as prophethood and otherwise, so that they might give it to whomever they want?",
  "Or do they possess the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them? If this is what they claim: Then let them ascend by the means, [of ascension] that lead to the heaven and bring [down] some revelation (wahy) and then assign it exclusively to whomever they wish (am in both verses represents the [rhetorical] hamza of denial).",
  "A routed (mahzmun is an adjectival qualification of jundun, \u0060host\u0027) host [is all that they are], in other words, they are [nothing but] a despicable host, nothing more -- in their denial of you -- from among the factions (mina\u0027l-ahzbi, also an adjectival qualification of jundun) in other words, [they are] like those hosts of factions who were in confederation against prophets before you: these were defeated and destroyed, and likewise We shall destroy these [people].",
  "Before them the people of Noah denied (the inflection of [the verb kadhdabat, \u0060denied\u0027, that is governed by] qawmu, \u0060people\u0027, is in the feminine person because of the [implicit] sense), and [so did those of] \u0060d and Pharaoh, he of the stakes -- he used to fix four stakes for the person who incurred his wrath and tie to these [stakes] that person\u0027s hands and feet and then torture him --",
  "and Thamd and the people of Lot and the dwellers in the wood, a small forest, namely, the people of Shu\u0060ayb, peace be upon him -- those were the factions.",
  "Each one, of the factions, did not but deny the messengers, for when they deny one, they have [in effect] denied them all, since their call [to God] is [the same] one, namely, the call to [affirmation of] His Oneness. So My retribution was justified, [it was] necessary.",
  "And these, that is, the disbelievers of Mecca, do not await but a single Cry, namely, the Blast of the Resurrection that will herald chastisement for them, for which there will be no revoking (read fawq or fuwq).",
  "And they said -- after the following [verse] was revealed, As for him who is given his book in his right hand ... to the end [of the verse, Q. 69:19] -- \u0060Our Lord, hasten on for us the record of our deeds before the Day of Reckoning\u0027 -- they said this mockingly.",
  "God, exalted be He, says: Bear patiently what they say and remember Our servant David, the one of fortitude, that is to say, [the one] of fortitude in worship: he used to fast every other day and keep vigil for half the night, sleep for a third and then keep vigil for the [last] sixth. Indeed he was a penitent [soul], always returning to what pleases God.",
  "Truly We disposed the mountains to glorify [God] with him, with the same glorification, at evening, at the time of the night prayer, and at sunrise, at the time of the morning prayer, which is when the sun has fully risen with its light extending everywhere.",
  "And, We disposed, the birds, mustered [in flocks], gathered before him, glorifying with him; each, of the mountains and birds, turning to him, reverting to obedience of him by glorifying [God with him].",
  "And We strengthened his Kingdom, We reinforced it with guards and hosts: every night there thirty thousand men would be standing guard at his sanctuary; and gave him wisdom, prophethood and sound judgement in [all] matters, and decisive speech, [the ability to formulate] a satisfactory statement [for a decision] in any endeavour.",
  "And has there come to you, O Muhammad (s) (the purpose of the interrogative [indicated by hal] here is to provoke curiosity and a desire to listen to what will follow) the tale of the disputants, when they scaled the sanctuary?, David\u0027s sanctuary, that is, his place of prayer, for they had been prohibited from entering by the [front] gates because of his being engaged in worship, in other words, [has it come to you] their tale and their account?",
  "When they entered upon David, and he was frightened by them. And they said, \u0060Do not fear; we are, two disputants (some say that this means \u0060two groups\u0027, in order to agree with the plural person [of the verb dakhal, \u0060they entered\u0027]; others say, \u0060two individuals\u0027 with the plural person actually denoting these two; al- khasm may refer to a one or more individuals. These two were angels who had come in the form of two disputants, between whom there [was supposed to have] occurred the situation mentioned -- [but] only hypothetically -- in order to alert David, peace be upon him, to what he had done: he had ninety nine women but desired the woman of a man who had only her and no other. He [David] had married her and consummated the marriage. One of us has infringed upon the [rights of the] other, so judge justly between us and do not transgress, [do not] be unjust, and guide us, direct us, to the right path\u0027, the correct way.",
  "\u0060Behold, this brother of mine, in other words, my fellow co-religionist, has ninety-nine ewes -- here used to represent the women -- while I have a single ewe; yet he said, \u0022Entrust it to me\u0022, in other words, make me in charge of it, and he overcame me in speech\u0027, in other words, in the argument; so the latter conceded charge of it to him.",
  "He said, \u0060He has certainly wronged you by asking for your ewe that he may add it to his sheep. And indeed many associates infringe upon [the rights of] one another, except such as believe and perform righteous deeds, but few are they!\u0027 (m emphasises the \u0060fewness\u0027). As the two angels were ascending to the heaven one said to the other, \u0060He has certainly passed judgement on himself!\u0027 David was thus alerted [to his deed]. God, exalted be He, says: And David thought, in other words, he became certain, that We had indeed tried him, that We had caused him to fall into a trial, that is, a test, through his love for that woman. So he sought forgiveness of his Lord and fell down bowing, in other words, prostrate, and repented.",
  "So We forgave him that and indeed he has [a station of] nearness with Us, that is, [even] more good [things] in this world, and a fair return, in the Hereafter.",
  "\u0060O David! We have indeed made you a vicegerent on the earth, managing the affairs of people; so judge justly between people and do not follow desire, that is, the desires of the soul, that it then lead you astray from the way of God, that is to say, from the proofs that indicate [the truth of] His Oneness. Truly those who go astray from the way of God, in other words, from belief in God -- for them there will be a severe chastisement because of their forgetting the Day of Reckoning\u0027, as a result of their having neglected faith. For had they been certain of [the truth of] the Day of Reckoning, they would have [first] been believers in this world.",
  "And We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in vain, frivolously. That, namely, the creation of what has been mentioned as being for no [particular] purpose, is the supposition of those who disbelieve, from among the people of Mecca. So woe -- a valley [in hell-fire] -- to the disbelievers from the Fire!",
  "Or shall We treat those who believe and perform righteous deeds like those who cause corruption in the earth; or shall We treat the God-fearing like the profligate? This was revealed when the Meccan disbelievers said to the believers, \u0060In the Hereafter we will receive the same [reward] as that which you will receive\u0027 (am, \u0060or\u0027, contains the [rhetorical] hamza of denial).",
  "A Book (kitbun, the predicate of a missing subject, namely, hdh, \u0060this is\u0027) that We have revealed to you, full of blessing, that they may contemplate (yaddabbar is actually yatadabbar, but the t\u0027 has been assimilated with the dl) its signs, [that] they may reflect upon its meanings and become believers, and that they may remember, that they may be admonished -- those people of pith, those possessors of intellect.",
  "And We bestowed on David, Solomon, his son -- what an excellent servant!, that is, Solomon. Truly he was a penitent [soul], always returning [to God] with glorification and remembrance at all times.",
  "When one evening -- which is the period after midday -- there were displayed before him the prancing steeds (al-sfint, \u0060horses\u0027, is the plural of sfina, which denotes [a horse] standing on three legs with the fourth supported on the edge of the hoof, and derives from [the verb] safana, yasfinu sufnan; al-jiyd is the plural of jawd, which is a \u0060racer\u0027; the meaning is that these [horses] are such that when they are halted they stand still and when they run they surpass [others] in speed). One thousand horses were displayed before him after he had performed the midday prayer, for he had wanted to use them in a holy struggle (jihd) against an enemy. But when the display reached the nine-hundredth [horse], the sun set and he had not performed the afternoon prayer. So he was greatly distressed.",
  "He said, \u0060Lo! I have loved, I have desired, the love of [worldly] good things, that is, [of] horses, over the remembrance of my Lord\u0027, that is, [over] the afternoon prayer, until it, that is, the sun, disappeared behind the [night\u0027s] veil, [until] it was concealed by that which veils it from sight.",
  "Bring them back to me!, that is, the horses that were displayed; and they so brought them back. Then he set about slashing, with his sword, [their] legs (al-sq is the plural of sq) and necks, in other words, he slaughtered them and cut off their legs as an offering [of atonement] to God, exalted be He, for having been distracted by them from the prayer. He gave all the meat thereof as voluntary alms and so God compensated him what was better and faster that these [horses], and this was the wind, which blew at his command as he wished.",
  "And We certainly tried Solomon: We tested him by wresting his kingdom from him, because he had married a woman [solely] out of his desire for her. She used to worship idols in his [own] home without his knowledge. Now, [control of] his kingdom lay in his ring. On one occasion, needing to withdraw [to relieve himself], he took it off and left it with this woman of his, whose name was al-Amna, as was his custom; but a jinn, [disguised] in the form of Solomon, came to her and seized it from her. And We cast upon his throne a [lifeless] body, which was that [very] jinn, and he was [the one known as] Sakhr -- or it was some other [jinn]; he sat upon Solomon\u0027s throne and so [as was the case with Solomon] the birds and other [creatures] devoted themselves to him [in service]. When Solomon came out [of his palace], having seen him [the jinn] upon his throne, he said to the people, \u0060I am Solomon [not him]!\u0027 But they did not recognise him. Then he repented -- Solomon returned to his kingdom, many days later, after he had managed to acquire the ring. He wore it and sat upon his throne [again].",
  "He said, \u0060My Lord! Forgive me and grant me a kingdom that shall not belong to anyone after me, in other words, other than me (this [use of min ba\u0060d to mean \u0060other than me\u0027] is similar to [Q. 45:23] fa-man yahdh min ba\u0060di\u0027Llh, \u0060who will guide him other than God?\u0027). Truly You are the Bestower\u0027.",
  "So We disposed for him the wind, which blew softly, gently, at his command wherever he intended.",
  "And the devils [also We disposed], every builder, building marvellous edifices, and diver, in the sea, bringing up pearls,",
  "and others too, from among them, bounded together in fetters, in shackles with their hands tied to their necks.",
  "And We said to him: \u0060This is Our gift. So bestow, grant thereof to whomever you wish, or withhold, from giving, without any reckoning\u0027, in other words, without your being called to account for any of this.",
  "And indeed he has [a station of] nearness with Us and a fair resort -- a similar [statement] has already appeared [in another verse above].",
  "And mention also Our servant Job, when he called out to his Lord, [saying], \u0060Lo! Satan has afflicted me with hardship, harm, and suffering\u0027, pain: he attributes all this to Satan, even though all things are from God, to show reverence [in his call] to Him, exalted be He.",
  "And it was said to him: \u0060Stamp your foot, on the ground -- and he stamped [it] and a spring of water gushed forth, and it was said: This is a cool bath, [cool] water for you to wash with, and a drink\u0027, for you to drink of. So he washed himself and drank [from it] whereat every ailment that had affected him internally and externally disappeared.",
  "And We gave him [back] his family along with others like them, that is, God brought back to life all the children of his that had died and provided him with as many [in addition to them], as a mercy, a grace, from us, and a reminder, an admonition, to people of pith, possessors of intellect.",
  "And [We said to him], \u0060Take in your hand a bunch of twigs, or some blades of grass, and smite therewith, your wife -- for he had sworn to smite her a hundred times on one occasion when she was late in coming to him -- and do not break [your] oath\u0027, by not smiting her: so he took a hundred rushes and smote her with them once [and that sufficed to fulfil his oath]. Truly We found him to be steadfast. What an excellent servant!, [was] Job. Indeed he was a penitent [soul], always returning to God, exalted be He.",
  "And mention [also] Our servants Abraham, and Isaac and Jacob -- men of fortitude, vigorous in their worship, and insight, deep understanding of religion (a variant reading [for \u0060ibdan, \u0060Our servants\u0027] has [singular] \u0060abdan, \u0060Our servant\u0027, with Ibrhma as the explication thereof, and what follows as being a supplement to \u0060abdan, \u0060Our servant\u0027).",
  "Assuredly We purified them with an exclusive [thought], namely, the remembrance of the Abode, of the Hereafter: in other words to [always] remember it and to work for it (a variant reading [for bi-khlisatin dhikr\u0027l-dr] has the genitive construction [bi-khlisati dhikr\u0027l-dr], making this [dhikr al-dr, \u0060remembrance of the Abode\u0027] the explicative thereof).",
  "And indeed in Our sight they are of the elect, the excellent (akhyr is the plural of khayyir).",
  "And mention [also] Our servants Ishmael, and Elisha, who was a prophet (the lm [here in al-Yasa\u0060] is extra) and Dh\u0027l-Kifl -- there is disagreement over whether he was a prophet; it is said that [he was so called because] he looked after (kafala) a hundred prophets who had sought refuge with him from being killed. Each, that is, every one of them, was among the excellent (akhyr is the plural of khayyir).",
  "This is a remembrance, of them, [made] by [the mention of] fair praise [of them] here; and indeed for the God-fearing, who comprise them, there will truly be a fair return, in the Hereafter --",
  "Gardens of Eden (jannti \u0060Adnin is either a substitution for, or an explicative supplement to, husna ma\u0027bin, \u0060a fair return\u0027) whose gates are [flung] open for them;",
  "reclining therein, on couches; therein they call for plenteous fruit and drink.",
  "And with them [there] will be maidens of restrained glances, restricting their eyes to their spouses, of a like age, of the same age, girls who are thirty three years of age (atrb is the plural of tirb).",
  "\u0060This, that is mentioned, is what you are promised, by way of the unseen (there is a shift in the address away from the third [to the second] person]) for the Day of Reckoning.",
  "This is indeed Our provision, which will never be exhausted\u0027, in other words, one which will never cease (this [last] sentence [m lahu min nafdin] is a circumstantial qualifier referring to rizqun, \u0060Our provision\u0027; or it is a second predicate of inna, \u0060indeed\u0027, meaning that it will be \u0060everlasting\u0027).",
  "That, which is mentioned, will be [the reward] for the believers [is so]; but for the insolent (this is a new sentence) there will surely be an evil [place of] return --",
  "Hell, which they will enter -- an evil resting place!",
  "This, chastisement -- inferred [as so] by what follows -- let them then taste it: burning hot water and pus (read ghasq or ghassq), the festering matter excreted by the inhabitants of the Fire;",
  "and other (khar may be plural or singular) kinds [of torment] resembling it, in other words, like the boiling water and pus mentioned, in pairs, of all sorts, in other words, their chastisement will consist of various kinds.",
  "And it will be said to them as they enter the Fire with their followers: \u0060This is a horde about to plunge, to enter, with you, into the Fire violently -- at which point those who used to be followed say: no welcome [is there] for them [here]!, in other words, [they will find] no comfort for them [here]. They will indeed roast in the Fire\u0027.",
  "They, the followers, say, \u0060Nay, but for you [there is] no welcome! You prepared this, that is, disbelief, for us. So what an evil abode!\u0027, for us and for you, is the Fire.",
  "They, also, say, \u0060Our Lord, whoever prepared this for us, give him double his chastisement, that is, [give him in addition] the like of his chastisement, for his disbelief, in the Fire!\u0027",
  "And they, the disbelievers of Mecca, say, while they are in the Fire: \u0060What is the matter with us that we do not see [here] men whom we used to count, in the world, among the wicked?",
  "Did we treat them mockingly? (read sukhriyyan, or sikhriyyan), did we use to deride them in [the life of] the world (the [final] y\u0027 [in sikhriyy] is attributive). In other words, are they missing? Or have [our] eyes missed them [here]?\u0027, so that we have not caught sight of them. Such [men] were the poor among the Muslims, like \u0060Ammr [b. Ysir], Bill [al-Habash], Suhayb [al-Rm] and Salmn [al-Fris].",
  "Assuredly that is true: such [a scene] will necessarily take place, which is, the wrangling of the inhabitants of the Fire -- as shown above.",
  "Say, O Muhammad (s), to the disbelievers of Mecca: \u0060I am only a warner, to threaten [disbelievers] with [punishment in] the Fire. And there is no god except God, the One, the All-Compelling, of [all] His creatures;",
  "Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the Mighty, Whose way [always] prevails, the [ever] Forgiving\u0027, of His friends.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060It is a tremendous tiding",
  "from which you are turning away, namely, the Qur\u0027n, of which I have informed you and in which I have brought you what can only be known by revelation, and that is God\u0027s saying:",
  "I had no knowledge of the High Council, that is to say, [of] the angels, when they disputed, in the matter of Adam, when God, exalted be He, said [to them]: \u0060I am appointing on earth a vicegerent\u0027, to the end [of the verse, Q. 2:30].",
  "All that is revealed to me is that I am just a plain warner\u0027, one whose warning is clear.",
  "Mention, when your Lord said to the angels, \u0060Indeed I am about to create a human being out of clay, and this was Adam.",
  "So when I have proportioned him, completed him, and breathed in him, [when I have] caused to flow [therein], My spirit, so that he becomes a living [being] -- the addition of \u0060the spirit\u0027 to Adam is an honour for him; the \u0060spirit\u0027 is a subtle body that gives life to a human being by permeating him -- then fall down in prostration before him!\u0027 -- a prostration of salutation [that is actually] a bow.",
  "Thereat the angels prostrated, all of them together (there are two emphases here [kulluhum and ajma\u0060n]);",
  "except Ibls, the father of the jinn, who was among the [audience of] angels; he was disdainful and he was one of the disbelievers, according to God\u0027s knowledge, exalted be He.",
  "He said, \u0060O Ibls! What prevents you from prostrating before that which I have created with My own hands?, in other words, whose creation I [Myself] have undertaken. This [in itself] is an honour for Adam, as God has [Himself] undertaken the [unmediated] creation of all creatures. Are you being arrogant, now, in refraining from prostrating (an interrogative meant as a rebuke); or are you of the exalted?\u0027, of the proud, and have therefore disdained to prostrate yourself, because you are one of them?",
  "He said, \u0060I am better than him. You created me from fire and You created him from clay\u0027.",
  "He said, \u0060Then begone hence, that is, from Paradise -- or, it is said, [begone] from the heavens -- for you are indeed accursed, outcast.",
  "And indeed My curse shall be on you until the Day of Judgement\u0027, [the Day] of Requital.",
  "He said, \u0060My Lord, then reprieve me until the day when they, mankind, will be raised\u0027.",
  "He said, \u0060Then you will indeed be among the reprieved",
  "until the day of the known time\u0027, the time of the First Blast.",
  "He said, \u0060Now, by Your might, I shall surely pervert them all,",
  "except those servants of Yours among them who will be saved\u0027, namely, the believers.",
  "He said, \u0060So the truth is -- and the truth I [always] speak (read both [words] in the accusative [fa\u0027l-haqqa wa\u0027l-haqqa]; or with the first in the nominative and the second in the accusative because of the verb [aqlu, \u0060I speak\u0027] that follows. As for reading the first one in the accusative, this would be on account of the mentioned verb [qla, \u0060he said\u0027]; but it is also said to be on account of its being a verbal noun, the sense being uhiqqu l-haqqa, \u0060I establish the truth\u0027; or [it is in the accusative by implication] if the particle for the oath [fa] is removed. It [the first haqq] could also be in the nominative because of its being the subject of a missing predicate, as in fa\u0027l-haqqu minn, \u0060truth [comes] from Me\u0027. It is also said that [the sentence means] fa\u0027l-haqqu qasam, \u0060the truth is [this] oath from Me\u0027, the response to which is the following [la-amla\u0027anna ...]) --",
  "I shall assuredly fill Hell with you, by way of [filling it with] your progeny, and with whoever of them follows you, that is, of mankind, all together\u0027.",
  "Say: \u0060I do not ask of you, in return for this, for delivering the Message [to you], any reward, any fee; nor am I an impostor, so as to make up the Qur\u0027n myself.",
  "It is only, in other words, the Qur\u0027n is only, a reminder, an admonition, for all worlds, [those of] humans, jinn and [other] rational beings, [but] excluding the angels.",
  "And you will assuredly come to know, O disbelievers of Mecca, its tiding, the news of its truth, in [due] time\u0027, that is to say, on the Day of Resurrection (\u0060ilm, \u0060knowing\u0027, is here being used in the sense of \u0060urf, \u0060experience\u0027; the prefixed lm [in la-ta\u0060lamunna, \u0060you will assuredly know\u0027] is for an implicit oath, in other words [what is meant is] wa\u0027Llhi [la-ta\u0060lamunna, \u0060By God you will assuredly know\u0027]). Meccan, except for verses 52, 53 and 54, which are Medinese; it consists of 75 verses, revealed after [srat] Saba\u0027.",
  "The revelation of the Book, the Qur\u0027n (tanzlu\u0027l-kitbi, the subject) is from God (mina\u0027Llhi, its predicate) the Mighty, in His kingdom, the Wise, in His handiwork.",
  "Indeed We have revealed to you, O Muhammad (s), the Book with the truth (bi\u0027l-haqqi is semantically connected to anzaln, \u0060We have revealed\u0027); so worship God, devoting your religion purely to Him, [pure] of any idolatry, in other words, affirming His Oneness.",
  "Surely to God belongs pure religion, none other than Him being deserving of it. And those who take besides Him, the idols [as], patrons: and they are the disbelievers of Mecca -- they say: \u0060We only worship them so that they may bring us near to God\u0027 (zulf, a verbal noun, with the sense of taqrban, \u0060for the sake of nearness\u0027). God will indeed judge between them, and the Muslims, concerning that about which they differ, of religion, and so admit the believers into Paradise, and the disbelievers into the Fire. Truly God does not guide one who is a liar, attributing a child to Him, a disbeliever, worshipping other than God.",
  "Had God wanted to take a son -- as they allege [that He has], \u0060The Compassionate One has taken [to Himself] a son\u0027 [Q. 19:88], He could have chosen from what He has created whatever He willed, and taken it as a child, instead of the angels whom they claim to be God\u0027s daughters, or [their claim] that \u0060Ezra is the son of God\u0027, or that \u0060Jesus is the son of God\u0027 [cf. Q. 9:30]. Glory be to Him, in exaltation of Him as being above that He should take a child. He is God, the One, the All-Compelling, over all His creatures.",
  "He created the heavens and the earth with the truth (bi\u0027l-haqqi is semantically connected to khalaqa, \u0060He created\u0027). He turns the night into day, so that it grows, and turns the day into night, so that it grows, and He has disposed the sun and the moon, each running, in its course, for an appointed term, until the Day of Resurrection. Verily it is He Who is the Mighty, Whose way [always] prevails, Requiter of His enemies, the [ever] Forgiving, of His friends.",
  "He created you from a single soul, namely, Adam, then made from it its mate, Eve; and He sent down for you of the cattle, [of] camels, cows, small cattle, sheep and goats, eight kinds, of each kind a male and a female -- as He makes clear in srat al-An\u0060m [Q. 6:143f.]. He creates you in your mothers\u0027 wombs, creation after creation, that is to say, as a sperm-drop, then a blood clot, then a foetus, in a threefold darkness, that is, the darkness of the belly, that of the womb and that of the placenta. That is God, your Lord. To Him belongs [all] sovereignty. There is no god except Him. Why then are you being turned away?, from worshipping Him to worshipping [things] other than Him?",
  "If you are ungrateful, indeed God is Independent of you, though He does not approve of ingratitude for His servants, even if He should will it [to manifest itself] in some of them. And if you give thanks, to God and thus become believers, He will approve of it (read yardah, or yardahu, either lengthening the vowel or not), that is, [of such] thankfulness, for you. And no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another [soul], in other words, it will not bear [the responsibility for] it. Then to your Lord will be your return, whereat He will inform you of what you used to do. Indeed He is Knower of what is in the breasts, of what is in the hearts [of men].",
  "And when distress befalls a person, that is, the disbeliever, he supplicates his Lord, he implores, turning, returning, to Him penitently. Then, when He bestows on him a grace from Himself, he forgets, he neglects, Him Whom he had supplicated, implored, before, namely, God (in other words m functions as min, \u0060whom\u0027) and sets up equals, associates, with God, that he may lead [others] astray (read li-yadilla or li-yudilla) from His way -- [from] the religion of Islam. Say: \u0060Revel in your ingratitude for a while -- for the remainder of your term [of life]. You shall indeed be among the inhabitants of the Fire\u0027.",
  "Or is he who (read, softened, a-man) devotes himself [in worship], observing duties of obedience, in the watches of the night, [during] its hours, prostrating and standing, in prayer, apprehensive of the [eventuality of the] Hereafter, in other words, fearing its chastisement, and hoping for the mercy, the Paradise, of his Lord ... ?, like one who is disobedient through disbelief or otherwise? (a variant reading has am-man, pronouncing the hamza, so that am has the sense of bal, \u0060rather\u0027). Say: \u0060Are those who know equal with those who do not know?\u0027, in other words, they are not equal, just as the person of knowledge is not equal to the ignorant one. Only people of pith, possessors of intellect, remember, [only they] are admonished.",
  "Say: \u0060O servants of Mine who believe! Fear your Lord, that is to say, [fear] His chastisement, by being obedient to Him. For those who are virtuous in this world, through obedience, there will be good, and that is Paradise, and God\u0027s earth is vast, so emigrate throughout it, away from the [company of] disbelievers and the sight of indecencies. Truly the steadfast, in [their] obedience [of God] and in [enduring] whatever [hardship] they may be tested with, will be paid their reward in full without any reckoning\u0027, without any measure or any scales [to work it out].",
  "Say: \u0060Indeed I have been commanded to worship God devoting [my] religion purely to Him, [pure] of any idolatry,",
  "and I have been commanded to be the first of those who submit\u0027, from this community.",
  "Say: \u0060Indeed, should I disobey my Lord, I fear the chastisement of a tremendous day\u0027.",
  "Say: \u0060God [alone] I worship, devoting [my] religion purely to Him, [pure] of any idolatry.",
  "So worship whatever you wish besides Him\u0027, other than Him -- herein is a threat for them as well as a declaration [of the fact] that they do not worship God, exalted be He. Say: \u0060Indeed the losers are those who [will] have lost their souls and their families on the Day of Resurrection, by condemning their souls to abide [forever] in the Fire, and their failure to attaining [the bliss promised among] the black-eyed virgins who would have been prepared for them in Paradise had they been believers. Truly that is the manifest loss!\u0027",
  "Above them they will have canopies, layers, of fire, and beneath them [they will have [similar] canopies, of fire. That is what God frightens His servants with, that is, the believing ones, that they may have fear of Him -- this [sense of the verse] is suggested by [what follows]), \u0022So, O servants of Mine, fear Me!\u0022\u0027",
  "As for those who steer clear of the worship of false deities, graven images, and turn penitently, apply themselves, to God, there are good tidings for them, of Paradise. So give [such] good tidings to My servants,",
  "who listen to the words [of God] and follow the best [sense] of it, which is that which contains [the means to] righteousness for them. Those, they are the ones whom God has guided; and those, they are the people of pith, the possessors of intellect.",
  "Can he against whom the word of chastisement has been fulfilled ...?, namely [the words], I will surely fill Hell [with jinn and mankind together] [Q. 11:119]; Will you deliver, bring out, one who is in the Fire? (this is the response to the conditional clause, in which the overt qualification [man f\u0027l-nr, \u0060one who is in the Fire\u0027] replaces the pronominalisation [a-fa-man, \u0060he ... whom\u0027]; the hamza [in a-fa-anta, \u0060will you\u0027] is for rejection, in other words [the sense is that] you will not be able to guide him and therefore deliver him from the Fire).",
  "But as for those who fear their Lord, and therefore obey Him -- for them there will be lofty abodes with [other] lofty abodes built above them, with rivers flowing beneath them, that is, beneath [both] the upper and the lower abodes -- a promise of God (wa\u0060da\u0027Llhi, in the accusative because of an implied verb governing it). God does not fail the tryst, [He does not break] His promise.",
  "Have you not seen, realised, that God sends down water from the heaven, then conducts it as springs, making it enter points of springs, in the ground? Then with it He brings forth crops of diverse hues. Then they wither, they become dried-out, and you see them, for example, after having been green, turning yellow. Then He turns them into chaff. Truly in that there is a reminder for people of pith, possessors of intellect, by which they may be reminded, for it is an indication of God\u0027s Oneness and His power.",
  "Is he whose breast God has opened to Islam, and becomes guided, so that he follows a light from his Lord ...?, like he whose heart He has sealed [with disbelief]? -- this [understanding of the ellipsis] is indicated by [what follows]. So woe -- an expression indicating \u0060chastisement\u0027 -- to those whose hearts have been hardened against the remembrance of God, that is, [hardened] against the acceptance of the Qur\u0027n. Such are in manifest error.",
  "God has revealed the best of discourses, a Book (kitban, substitutes for ahsana, \u0060the best\u0027) namely, a Qur\u0027n, consimilar, in other words, some of its parts are similar to others in terms of [their] arrangement and otherwise, in coupled phrases -- [a Book] in which the Promise [of reward] is coupled with the Threat [of punishment], together with other such [couplings] -- whereat quiver, at the mention of whose Threat shiver, the skins of those who fear their Lord; then their skins and their hearts soften to, they are reassured by, the remembrance of God, that is, at the mention of His Promise. That, Book, is God\u0027s guidance, by which He guides whomever He will, of His servants; and whomever God leads astray, for him there is no guide.",
  "Is he who will be fending off, [is he] who will encounter, with his face the awful chastisement on the Day of Resurrection ...?, that is, the most severe [chastisement], when he is flung into the Fire with his hands bound to his neck in fetters, [is he] like one who will be secure from it by entering Paradise? And it will be said to the wrongdoers, namely, the disbelievers of Mecca: \u0060Taste [now] what you used to earn\u0027, that is, [taste] the requital for it.",
  "Those who were before them denied, their messengers with regard to the coming of the chastisement; and so the chastisement came on them whence they were not aware, in a way that would never have occurred to them.",
  "So God made them taste disgrace, abasement and humiliation, in the way of being transformed [into swine] and being killed and otherwise, in the life of this world. And the chastisement of the Hereafter will surely be greater, had they, that is, the deniers, known, [the nature of] the chastisement thereof, they would not have denied.",
  "And verily We have struck, coined, for mankind in this Qur\u0027n every [kind of] similitude, that perhaps they may remember, [that perhaps] they may be admonished --",
  "an Arabic Qur\u0027n (qur\u0027nan \u0060arabiyyan, a circumstantial qualifier for emphasis) without any deviation, that is, [without] any contradiction or variance, that perhaps they may guard themselves, against disbelief.",
  "God strikes, for the idolater and the believer in God\u0027s Oneness, a similitude: a man (rajulan, substitutes for mathalan, \u0060a similitude\u0027) shared by several [masters], quarrelling, disputing, ill-mannered, and a man belonging exclusively to one man. Are the two equal in comparison? (mathalan, for specification), in other words, the slave of many [masters] is not the same as the slave of a single person. For in the case of the former, if all of his masters were to demand his service simultaneously, he would be confused as to whom of them he should serve -- which is the similitude of the idolater; the latter [the slave of one] is the similitude of the one who believes in the One God. Praise be to God!, alone. Nay, but most of them, that is, the people of Mecca, do not know, the chastisement in which they will end up and so they associate others with God.",
  "You -- an address to the Prophet (s) -- will indeed die, and they [too] will indeed die, and so there is no satisfaction to be gained from [another\u0027s] death: this was revealed because they kept waiting for the Prophet (s) to die.",
  "Then you will indeed, O mankind, concerning the injustices you committed towards one another, be contending before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection.",
  "So who is -- in other words, none is -- a greater wrongdoer than he who imputes falsehood to God, by ascribing partners and child to Him, and [who] denies the truth, namely, the Qur\u0027n, when it reaches him? Is there not a [fitting] abode in Hell for the disbelievers? Indeed, there is.",
  "And he who brings the truth -- and that is the Prophet (s) -- and [those] who confirm it, namely, the believers (here alladh, \u0060he who\u0027, has the significance of alladhna, \u0060those who\u0027), those, they are the ones who guard themselves, against idolatry.",
  "They shall have whatever they wish with their Lord. That is the reward of those who are virtuous, to their own souls through their [acceptance of] faith;",
  "so that God may absolve them of the worst of what they did, and pay them their reward by the best of what they used to do (aswa\u0027a and ahsana mean [simply] al-sayyi\u0027, \u0060bad\u0027, and al-hasan, \u0060good\u0027).",
  "Does God not suffice [as defender of] His servant?, the Prophet? Indeed, He does. Yet they would frighten you -- the address is for him (s) -- of those besides Him, namely, the idols, [by telling him] that these [idols] might kill him or render him insane. And whomever God leads astray, for him there is no guide.",
  "But whomever God guides, there is no one [able] to lead him astray. Is not God Mighty, One Whose way [always] prevails, a Lord of Retribution?, against His enemies? Indeed, He is.",
  "And if (wa-la-in: the lm is for oaths) you ask them, \u0060Who created the heavens and the earth?\u0027 they will surely say, \u0060God.\u0027 Say: \u0060Have you considered then those on whom you call, [those whom] you worship, besides God, namely, the idols, if God should desire some harm to befall me, would they [be able to] remove the harm imposed by Him? No! Or if He should desire some mercy for me, would they [be able to] withhold His mercy?\u0027 No! (a variant reading for the two clauses [kshiftun durrahu and mumsiktun rahmatahu] has the genitive construction [kshiftu durrihi and mumsiktu rahmatihi). Say: \u0060God is sufficient for me. In Him do [all] the trusting put their trust\u0027.",
  "Say: \u0060O my people! Act according to your situation, [according to] your circumstances, I [too] am acting, according to my circumstances. For you will [come to] know",
  "to whom (man, introduces the relative clause that is the direct object of [the action of] \u0060knowing\u0027) will come a chastisement that will disgrace him and on whom there will descend a lasting chastisement\u0027, an everlasting one, namely, the chastisement of the Fire. Indeed God [then] disgraced them at Badr.",
  "Truly We have revealed the Book to you for [the sake of] mankind with the truth (bi\u0027l-haqqi is semantically connected to anzaln, \u0060We have revealed\u0027). So whoever is guided, then it, his being guided, is for [the sake of] his own soul, and whoever goes astray, goes astray only to the detriment thereof. And you are not [meant to be] a guardian over them, and so compel them to [embrace] guidance.",
  "God takes the souls at the time of their death, and, He takes, those that have not died in their sleep, in other words, He takes them during sleep. Then He retains those for whom He has ordained death and releases the others until an appointed term, that is, until the time of their death. The one that is released is the soul [that possesses the faculty] of discernment, without which the soul [containing the force] of life is able to remain [temporarily] -- but this cannot be the other way round. Truly in that, mentioned, there are signs, indications, for a people who reflect, and then realise that the One with the power to do this also has the power to resurrect -- Quraysh, however, never reflected on this [fact].",
  "Or have they -- nay, but [they have] -- taken besides God, idols, as gods [to act as], intercessors?, with God, as they [are wont to] allege. Say, to them: \u0060What!, will they intercede, even though they have no power whatever, of intercession or otherwise, and are unable to comprehend?\u0027, that you worship them or [to comprehend] anything else [for that matter]? Nay.",
  "Say: \u0060All intercession belongs [solely] to God, that is to say, He has exclusive control over it, and so none can intercede except with His permission. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; then to Him you will be brought back\u0027.",
  "And when God is mentioned alone, that is, without [the mention of] their gods, thereat shrink, they are repelled and they become constricted, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter; but when those [others] besides Him, namely, the idols, are mentioned, behold, they rejoice!",
  "Say: \u0060O God! (Allhumma means y Allh) Originator of the heavens and the earth!, the Creator of them without precedent, Knower of the Unseen and the visible, [Knower of] what is hidden and what is witnessed, You will judge between Your servants concerning that wherein they used to differ\u0027, in the matter of religion: guide me to the truth over which they are at variance.",
  "And [even] if the evildoers possessed all that is in the earth, and as much of it besides, they would surely offer it to ransom themselves from the terrible chastisement on the Day of Resurrection. And there will appear, [there will become] manifest, to them from God that which they had never reckoned, [what they never] supposed [they would see].",
  "And there will appear to them the evils of what they had earned, and they will be besieged by, there will descend [on them], that which they used to deride, in other words, the chastisement.",
  "So when some distress befalls man (al-insn, here a generic), he supplicates Us. Then, when We bestow on him a grace from Us, he says, \u0060I was given it merely by force of knowledge\u0027, from God that I was deserving of it. Nay, but it, this saying, is a trial, a test by which servants are tested. But most of them do not know, that such bestowal [of grace] is a way of drawing [them] on and a test [of their faith].",
  "Already the same was said by those who were before them, of communities, such as Korah and those of his people who were content with such [a saying]. But what they used to earn did not avail them.",
  "So the evils of what they earned smote them, that is, the requital thereof [smote them]. And the evildoers among these, namely, [among] Quraysh, shall also be smitten by the evils of what they earned, and they will not be able to thwart it: [they will not] elude Our chastisement -- thus they were made to suffer seven years of drought and [only] afterwards were they enriched [with provision from God].",
  "Do they not know that God extends His provision, [that He] makes it abundant, for whomever He will, as a test, and restricts [it]?, for whomever He will, as a trial? Truly in that there are signs for a people who believe, in Him.",
  "Say [that God declares]: \u0060O My servants who have been prodigal against their own souls, do not despair (read taqnit, taqnat, or taqnut), do not give up hope, of God\u0027s mercy. Truly God forgives all sins, for those who repent from idolatry. Truly He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.",

  "so apply yourselves to this, before any soul should say, \u0060Alas for me (y hasrat is actually y hasrat, meaning \u0060O regret of mine\u0027) for what I have neglected of my duty to God, in other words, [of] obedience to Him. Indeed (wa-in: in is softened in place of the hardened form, in other words [understand it as] wa-inn) I was among those who ridiculed\u0027, His religion and His Book;",

  "\u0060Yes indeed! My signs came to you, the Qur\u0027n -- which is the means to guidance -- but you denied them and were arrogant, you disdained to believe in them, and you were among the disbelievers\u0027.",
  "And on the Day of Resurrection you will see those who imputed lies to God, by ascribing partner and child to Him, with their faces blackened. Is there not in Hell a [fitting] abode for those who are [too] arrogant?, to believe? Indeed [there is].",
  "And God will deliver, from Hell, those who fear, idolatry, because of their triumph, that is, on account of the place they have won in Paradise, by placing them in it. No evil will touch them, nor will they grieve.",
  "God is the Creator of all things and He is Guardian over all things, disposing of them as He will.",
  "To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth, in other words, the keys to their storehouses of rain and vegetation and other things. And those who disbelieve in the signs of God, [such as] the Qur\u0027n -- those, they are the losers (l\u0027ika humu\u0027l-khsirna is semantically connected to His words wa- yunajj\u0027Llhu\u0027lladhna ittaqaw, \u0060and God will deliver those who guarded themselves ...\u0027 to the end [of that statement]; the intervening statements are parentheticals).",

  "And certainly it has been revealed to you and to those before you [that], by God!, if you associate others [with God], O Muhammad (s) -- hypothetically -- your work shall surely fail and you shall surely be among the losers\u0027.",
  "Rather, worship God, alone, and be among the thankful, of His bestowal of graces on you.",
  "And they do not esteem God as He should be esteemed, they do not understand His true nature, or [it means] that they do not exalt Him with the exaltation truly worthy of Him, when they associate others with Him.

Glory be to Him! And exalted be He above what they associate!, with Him [of partners].",
  "And the Trumpet will be blown, for the First Blast, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth will swoon, will die, except whomever God wills, such as the houris, the beautiful youths [of Paradise] and others. Then it will be blown again, and behold, they, that is, all creatures who are dead, will rise up, looking on, waiting to see what will be done with them.",
  "And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord, when God reveals Himself for the passing of judgement, and the Book, of deeds, shall be set in place, for the Reckoning, and the prophets and witnesses, namely, Muhammad (s) and his community, will be brought, to bear witness that the messengers delivered [the Message to their respective communities]. And judgement will be made between them with truth, in other words, justly, and they will not be wronged, in a single thing.",
  "And every soul will be paid in full for what it did, that is, [it will be paid] the requital thereof, and He is best aware of what they do, and has no need for any witnesses.",
  "And those who disbelieve will be driven, violently, to Hell in troops, in separate groups, until, when they reach it, its gates are opened (futihat abwbuh is the response to idh, \u0060when\u0027) and its keepers will say to them, \u0060Did there not come to you [any] messengers from among yourselves, reciting to you the signs of your Lord, the Qur\u0027n and otherwise, and warning you of the encounter of this day of yours?\u0027 They will say, \u0060Yes, indeed; but the word of chastisement -- namely, the verse: Assuredly I will fill Hell ...

[The manner of] their being driven as well as the opening of the gates before their arrival is a way of honouring them; the driving of the disbelievers, however, and the opening of the gates only upon their arrival so that [all of] its heat is retained for them, is a means of humiliating them.",
  "And they will say: (this is a supplement to the implicit [response] dakhalh, \u0060they enter it\u0027) \u0060Praise be to God, Who has fulfilled His promise to us, of Paradise, and has made us inherit the land, the land of Paradise, that we may settle in Paradise wherever we wish\u0027, for it is all [Paradise], and there is no spot that can be preferred to another.

They were more powerful than them (a variant reading has minkum, \u0060than yourselves\u0027) in strength and in [their] vestiges on earth, in the way of large structures and palaces. Yet God seized them, He destroyed them, for their sins and they had none to shield them from God, from His chastisement.",
  "That was because their messengers used to bring them clear signs, manifest miracles, but they disbelieved. So God seized them. Indeed He is Strong, Severe in punishment.",

Indeed I fear that he may change your religion, [involving] your worship of me, so that you will then follow him [in his religion], or that he may cause corruption to appear in the land\u0027, by [initiating] killing and otherwise (a variant reading [for wa-an, \u0060and that\u0027] is aw-an, \u0060or that\u0027; a variant reading [for an yuzhira f\u0027l-ardi\u0027l-fasda] is [the impersonal construction] an yazhara f\u0027l-ardi\u0027l-fasdu, \u0060that corruption may appear in the land\u0027).",
  "And Moses said, to his people, after he had heard that [saying of Pharaoh]: \u0060Indeed I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning\u0027.",

If he is lying, then his mendacity will be to his own detriment, that is, the harm resulting from his mendacity [will be to his own detriment]; but if he is truthful, then there will befall you some of that with which he is threatening you, in the way of chastisement, soon.

So, that is, just as you have been led astray, God leads astray one who is a prodigal, an idolater, a skeptic\u0027, a doubter of that which the clear signs have certified.",
  "Those who dispute the signs of God, His miracles (alladhna yujdilna f yti\u0027Llhi, the subject) without any warrant, any evidence, that has come to them -- greatly hateful [is that], disputing of theirs (kabura, the predicate of the subject) in the sight of God and in the sight of those who believe. So, just as they have been led astray, God sets a seal, of misguidance, on the heart of every arrogant tyrant (read qalbin, \u0060the heart of\u0027, with nunation, or without, qalbi). As the heart grows arrogant, so does the individual and vice versa (kulli, in both readings, is meant to indicate the totality of the misguidance of such hearts, not the totality of the hearts).",

So, in the same way that these disbelievers have been led astray, God leads astray the disbelievers.",

And it was never [permitted] for any messenger, from among them, to bring a sign except with God\u0027s permission, for they are [also] servants enthralled [by Him].

  "And, mention, the day when God\u0027s enemies are gathered ([read either] yuhsharu a\u0060d\u0027u\u0027Llhi, or nahshuru a\u0060d\u0027a\u0027Llhi, \u0060[when] We gather God\u0027s enemies\u0027) to the Fire, for they will be driven [thereto],",
  "until, when they reach it (idh m: the m is extra), their hearing and their eyes and their skins will bear witness against them concerning what they used to do.",
  "And they will say to their skins, \u0060Why did you bear witness against us?\u0027 They will say, \u0060God made us speak, Who gave speech to all things, in other words, [all things] which He wanted to [be able to] speak. And He created you the first time, and to Him you will be returned: it is said that this statement is made by their skins; but it is also said to be God\u0027s words, as is the case with what follows, for it is similar in context to what preceded, namely, that the One with the power to originate you without any precedent and restore you to life after death, also has the power to make your skins and your limbs speak.",
  "And you did not use to conceal yourselves, when you used to commit lewd acts, lest your hearing or your eyes or your skins should bear witness against you, because you were never certain about [the truth of] resurrection; but you thought, when you used to conceal yourselves, that God did not know most of what you did.",
  "And that (wa-dhlikum, the subject) supposition of yours (zannukum, substitutes for it) which you supposed of your Lord (alladh zanantum bi-rabbikum, a descriptive clause; the predicate [is the following, ardkum]) has ruined you, that is, it has brought about your destruction. So you have become among the losers\u0027.",
  "So if they endure, the chastisement, the Fire will [still] be their abode; and if they seek reconciliation, if they seek the satisfaction [of God], then they will not be among the reconciled, those deemed satisfactory [by God].",
  "And We have assigned, We have occasioned [for], them companions, from among the devils, who have adorned for them that which is before them, of what concerns this world and the following after lusts, and that which is behind them, of what concerns the Hereafter, when they [make them] say that there will be neither resurrection nor reckoning. And the word, of chastisement -- namely, the verse: Assuredly I will fill Hell ... [Q. 11:119]) -- became due against them, being among, all those, communities that passed away, [that] were destroyed, before them of jinn and mankind. Truly they were losers.",
  "And those who disbelieve say, during the Prophet\u0027s (s) recitation [of the Qur\u0027n], \u0060Do not listen to this Qur\u0027n and hoot it down, make a din and so forth, and clamour whenever he is reciting, that perhaps you might prevail\u0027, so that he will then desist from recitation.",
  "God, exalted be He, says regarding them: But verily We will make those who disbelieve taste a severe chastisement, and We will verily requite them the worst of what they used to do, in other words, [with] the worst requital for their deeds.",
  "That, severe chastisement and worst requital, is the requital of God\u0027s enemies (jaz\u0027u a\u0060d\u0027i, the second hamza may be pronounced fully or replaced with a ww) -- the Fire! (al-nru, an explicative supplement to jaz\u0027u, \u0060the requital\u0027, alluded to by [the demonstrative] dhlika, \u0060that\u0027). Therein will be their everlasting abode, that is, as a place of [permanent] residence, from which there will be no removal, as a requital (jaz\u0027an is in the accusative as a verbal noun from the implicit verbal action) for their denial of Our signs, [for their denial of] the Qur\u0027n.",
  "And those who disbelieve will say, [while] in the Fire: \u0060Our Lord, show us those who led us astray from among the jinn and mankind -- namely, Ibls and Cain [respectively], both of whom established disbelief and slaying as something to be emulated -- so that we may have them underneath our feet [to trample them], in the Fire, that they may be among the lowermost\u0027, in other words, in a chastisement more severe than ours.",
  "Truly those who say, \u0060Our Lord is God!\u0027 and then remain upright, [adhering] to the affirmation of [God\u0027s] Oneness and to whatever else has been enjoined on them, the angels descend upon them, at the point of death, [saying to them], \u0060Do not fear, death and what will come after it, nor grieve, for any family or children that you have left behind, for we will look after them after you, and rejoice in the good tidings of the paradise which you were promised.",
  "We are your friends in the life of this world, that is, we will look after you in it, and in the Hereafter, in other words, we will be alongside you thereat until you enter Paradise; and therein you will have whatever your souls desire, and therein you will have whatever you request,",
  "as a hospitality, a pre-prepared provision (nuzulan is in the accusative because of an implied [preceding verb] \u0060appointed [for you]\u0027) from One Forgiving, Merciful\u0027, namely, God.",
  "And who speaks better [words] -- in other words, no one speaks better [words] -- than him who summons [others] to God, by affirming His Oneness, and acts righteously and says, \u0060Indeed I am one of those who submit [to God]\u0027?",
  "And they are not equal, the good deed and the evil deed, [even] with respect to their subdivisions, because any number of such [good deeds] are [always] above any number of the latter. Repel, the evil deed, with that, in other words, with that trait, which is better, such as [repelling] anger with endurance, ignorance with forbearance, and [the intention to inflict] harm with pardon, then, behold, he between whom and you there was enmity will be as though he were a dear friend, in other words, then your enemy will become like a close friend in terms of [his] affection [for you], if you act in such a way (alladh, \u0060he ... whom\u0027, is the subject; ka-annahu, \u0060as though\u0027, is the predicate; idh is an adverbial particle for [expressing] the comparative import).",
  "But none is granted it, in other words, [none] is given that better trait, except those who are steadfast; and none is granted it except one [deserving] of a great reward.",
  "And if (wa-imm: here the nn of the conditional particle in has been assimilated with the m, which is extra) some temptation from Satan should provoke you, in other words, if some diversion should turn you away from that [better] trait and other good acts, then seek refuge in God (this is the response to the conditional [\u0060and if\u0027]; the response to the command clause is omitted, being \u0060and He will ward it off from you\u0027). Truly He is the Hearer, of what is said, the Knower, of what is done.",
  "And among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun and moon, but prostrate to God Who created them, namely, these fours signs, if it is Him Whom you worship.",
  "But if they disdain, to prostrate to God alone, still those who are with your Lord, that is to say, still the angels, glorify, perform prayers to, Him night and day, and they tire not, they never weary [thereof].",
  "And among His signs is that you see the earth desolate, dried out, without any vegetation, but when We send down water upon it, it stirs, it moves, and swells, [swells] and rises. Truly He Who revives it is indeed the Reviver of the dead. Surely He has power over all things.",
  "Indeed those who blaspheme (yulhidna derives from [the verb] alhada, or lahada, \u0060he blasphemed\u0027) Our signs -- the Qur\u0027n, by denying [its truth] -- are not hidden from Us, and We will requite them. Is one who is cast into the Fire better [off], or one who arrives secure on the Day of Resurrection? Act as you wish; indeed He is Seer of what you do -- this is [meant as] a threat for them.",
  "Truly those who disbelieve in the Remembrance -- the Qur\u0027n -- when it comes to them ..., We will requite them -- and truly it is an unassailable Book:",
  "falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it, in other words, there is no scripture before it or after it that contradicts it; [it is] a revelation from One Wise, Praised, that is to say, [from] God, the One Who is praised in His affair.",
  "Nothing is said to you, in terms of denial [of you], except, the like of, what has already been said to the messengers before you. Surely your Lord is One of forgiveness, to believers, and [also] One of painful punishment, for disbelievers.",
  "And had We made it, namely, the Remembrance, a non-Arabic Qur\u0027n, they would have said, \u0060Why have its signs not been explained [clearly]?, so that we might understand them? What!, a Qur\u0027n [that is], non- Arabic and an Arab, prophet?\u0027 (this is an interrogative of denial [spoken] by them; read [a-a\u0060jamiyyun] pronouncing [both the first and] the second hamza, or by changing it into an alif and either writing it out in full or not). Say: \u0060For those who believe it is guidance, from error, and a healing, from [the disease of] ignorance; but as for those who do not believe, there is a deafness in their ears, a heaviness, and so they are unable to hear it, and they are blind to it, so they are unable to comprehend it. Those, they are [as if they were being] called from a distant place\u0027, that is to say, they are like one who is called from far away, unable to hear or comprehend what is being called out to him.",
  "And verily We gave Moses the Scripture, the Torah, but differences arose concerning it, in terms of [some] affirming the truth [of it] and [others] denying [it], as with the Qur\u0027n; and were it not for a Word that had [already] preceded from your Lord, to defer the reckoning and requital of creatures until the Day of Resurrection, judgement would have been made between them, in this world, concerning that over which they differed; for indeed they, the deniers of it, are in grave doubt concerning it, [doubt] which leads to [utter] uncertainty.",
  "Whoever acts righteously, it is for [the good of] his own soul, that he acts [thus], and whoever does evil, it is to the detriment thereof, in other words, the harm consequent from his evildoing will [only] be to him. And your Lord is not [at all] a tyrant to His servants, that is, He is not One of injustice, as He, exalted be He, says: Surely God shall not wrong so much as the weight of an atom [Q. 4:40].",
  "To Him devolves [all] knowledge of the Hour -- when it shall come to pass, none other than Him knows this. And no fruit (thamaratin: a variant reading has [the plural] thamartin, \u0060fruits\u0027) emerges from its sheath, its receptacle (akmm, the plural of kimm), except with His knowledge, and no female bears [child] or delivers except with His knowledge. And on the day when He will call out to them, \u0060Where [then] are My associates?\u0027 they will say, \u0060We proclaim to You, we now apprise You, that there is no witness amongst us\u0027, that is, a witness [who can testify to the allegation] that You have an associate.",
  "And what they used to call on, [what they used] to worship, before, in this world, of idols, has forsaken them and they suppose, they will be certain, that there is no refuge for them, no escape from the chastisement (the negation in both instances comments on the operation [implied in the nouns of actions; also the negation stands in place of the direct objects in both instances).",
  "Man never wearies of supplicating for good, in other words, he never ceases to ask his Lord for wealth and good health and other [good] things, but should any ill befall him, such as impoverishment or hardship, then he becomes despondent, despairing, of God\u0027s mercy -- this and what follows relates to [the attitude of] disbelievers.",
  "And if (wa-la-in: the lm is for oaths) We let him taste, [if] We bestow on him, mercy, [such as] riches or good health, from Us after the harm, the hardship or tribulation, that had befallen him, he will surely say, \u0060This is my due!, in other words, [it is] on account of what I do. I do not think that the Hour will ever set in, and even if (wa-la-in: the lm is for oaths) I am returned to my Lord, I will indeed have the best [reward] with Him\u0027, namely, Paradise. But We will assuredly inform those who disbelieve of what they did, and assuredly We will make them taste a harsh chastisement (the lm [prefixed] in both verbs is that for oaths).",
  "And when We bestow graces upon man (insn, the generic noun [is meant]), he shows disregard, of giving thanks, and turns aside, turns his head in arrogance (a variant reading [for n\u0027a] has na\u0027); but when ill befalls him, he makes prolonged supplications.",
  "Say: \u0060Consider [this]: if it, the Qur\u0027n, is from God, as the Prophet says, and you disbelieve in it, who -- in other words, none -- will be further astray than one who is in extreme defiance?\u0027, of the truth (this [third person singular address] is used instead of \u0060[who will be further astray] than you\u0027 in order to point out their status [as disbelievers]).",
  "We shall show them Our signs in the horizons, [in all] the regions of the heavens and the earth, in the way of the luminous [celestial] bodies, [the varieties of] vegetation and trees, and in their own souls, in the way of the exquisite craftsmanship and unique wisdom [inherent in their creation], until it becomes clear to them that it, namely, the Qur\u0027n, is the truth, revealed by God, informing of the Resurrection, the Reckoning and the Punishment, so that they [realise that they] will be punished for their disbelief in it and in the one who has come with it. Is it not sufficient that your Lord (bi-rabbika, governs the verb yakfi, \u0060sufficient\u0027) is witness to all things? (annahu \u0060al kulli shay\u0027in shahd, substitutes for bi-rabbika). In other words, is not sufficient proof of your truthfulness that nothing whatsoever can be hidden from God?",
  "Nay, verily they are in doubt about the encounter with their Lord, because they deny the Resurrection. Nay, verily He, exalted be He, encompasses all things, in knowledge and in power, and so He will requite them for their disbelief. Meccan, except for verses 23, 24, 25 and 26, which are Medinese; it consists of 53 verses revealed after [srat] Fussilat.",
  "H mm",
  "\u0060ayn sn qf: God knows best what He means by these [letters].",
  "Thus -- in other words, in the same [manner of] revelation -- does He reveal to you and, did He reveal, to those [who were] before you, God (Allhu, is the agent of [the action of] revelation) the Mighty, in His kingdom, the Wise, in His actions.",
  "To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, as possession, creation and servants, and He is the Exalted, above His creatures, the Tremendous, the Great.",
  "The heavens are well-nigh (read yakdu, or takdu) rent asunder (yanfatirna: a variant reading has yatafattarna) from above one another, in other words, [well-nigh] is each one torn away from above the one below it because of the magnitude of God, exalted be He, and the angels glorify with praise of their Lord, in other words, they are continuously engaged in praise [of Him], and ask forgiveness for those, believers, on earth. Verily God is the Forgiving, to His friends, the Merciful, to them.",
  "And those who have taken besides Him, namely, idols [as], guardians, God is watchful over them, He keeps count [of their deeds], that He may requite them; and you are not a guardian over them, in order to secure what is demanded of them: your duty is only to deliver the Message.",
  "And thus -- in the same [manner of] revelation -- have We revealed to you an Arabic Qur\u0027n, that you may warn, [that you may] threaten, the mother-town and those around it, namely, the inhabitants of Mecca and all other people, and that you may warn, [all] people, of the Day of Gathering, the Day of Resurrection whereat [all] creatures will be gathered, of which there is no doubt. A part, of them, will be in Paradise and a part will be in the Blaze, the Fire.",
  "And had God willed, He would have made them one community, in other words, following one religion, and that is Islam; but He admits whomever He will into His mercy, and the evildoers, the disbelievers, have neither guardian nor helper, to ward off the chastisement from them.",
  "Or have they taken, idols [as], guardians besides Him? (am, \u0060or\u0027, is disjunctive, functioning with the sense of bal, \u0060nay, but\u0027, the one used to denote a shift [in the subject matter]; the hamza is for denial, in other words \u0060those who are taken\u0027 [as guardians] are not [in fact] guardians [of anything]). But God, He [alone] is the Guardian, in other words, then One who helps believers (the f\u0027 [of fa\u0027Llhu] is merely for coordination) and He revives the dead, and He has power over all things.",
  "And whatever you may differ, with disbelievers, in, of religion or otherwise, the verdict therein belongs, it will return, to God, on the Day of Resurrection; He will judge between you. Say to them: That then is God, my Lord; in Him I have put my trust, and to Him I turn penitently.",
  "The Originator of the heavens and the earth, the One Who created them [without precedent]. He has made for you, from your own selves, pairs, when He created Eve from Adam\u0027s rib, and [also] pairs, males and females, of the cattle: He multiplies you (read yadhra\u0027ukum) by such [means], by the mentioned \u0060making\u0027, that is to say, He multiplies you through this [means] by way of propagation (the [suffixed] pronoun [-kum in yadhra\u0027ukum, \u0060He multiplies you\u0027] refers to both human beings and cattle, but predominantly [to humans]). There is nothing like Him (ka-mithlihi: the kf is extra, as there is no likeness of Him, exalted be He). He is the Hearer, of what is said, the Seer, of what is done.",
  "To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth, the keys to their storehouses of rain and vegetation and other things. He extends provision, He makes it abundant, for whomever He will, as a test [of their gratitude], and He restricts [it], He straitens it for whomever He will, as a trial. Truly He has knowledge of all things.",
  "He has prescribed for you as a religion that which He enjoined upon Noah -- for he was the first of the prophets [sent] with a [Divine] Law -- and that which We have revealed to you, and that which We enjoined upon Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus [declaring], \u0060Establish religion and do not be divided in it\u0027: this is what has been prescribed and enjoined upon [those mentioned above], and what has been revealed to Muhammad (s), and it is the affirmation of [God\u0027s] Oneness. Dreadful is for the idolaters that to which you summon them, in the way of affirming the Oneness [of God]. God chooses for it, for the [task of] affirming [His] Oneness, whomever He will, and He guides to it whomever turns penitently, [whomever] applies himself to obedience of Him.",
  "And they did not become divided, that is, the adherents of the [monotheistic] religions [did not become divided] in religion -- so that some affirmed the Oneness [of God], while others rejected it -- except after the knowledge, of His Oneness, had come to them, out of [jealous] rivalry, on the part of the disbelievers, among themselves. And were it not for a Word that preceded from your Lord, to defer requital [of them], until an appointed term, [until] the Day of Resurrection, it would have [already] been judged between them, to chastise the disbelievers in this world. And indeed those who were made heirs to the Scripture after them, namely, the Jews and the Christians, are truly in grave doubt concerning him, Muhammad (s).",
  "So to that then, [to that] affirmation of [God\u0027s] Oneness, summon, O Muhammad (s), people, and be upright, in [summoning them to] this, just as you have been commanded, and do not follow them in their desires, to abandon it. And say: \u0060I believe in whatever Book God has revealed. And I have been commanded to be just between you, in passing judgement. God is our Lord and your Lord. Our deeds concern us and your deeds concern you, and so each [one of us] will be requited according to his [own] deeds. There is no argument, [no] dispute, between us and you -- this was [revealed] before the command to struggle [against them]. God will bring us together, at the [time of the] Return to decide [definitively] between us, and to Him is the [final] destination\u0027, the [ultimate] return.",
  "And those who argue, with the Prophet, concerning, the religion of, God after His call has been answered, through faith, on account of His miracle having been manifested -- and they are the Jews -- their argument stands refuted, [is] invalid, with their Lord, and [His] wrath shall be upon them, and there will be a severe chastisement for them.",
  "God it is Who has revealed the Book, the Qur\u0027n, with the truth (bi\u0027l-haqqi is semantically connected to anzala, \u0060revealed\u0027) as well as the Balance, Justice. And what do you know -- perhaps the Hour, that is, its arrival, is near! (la\u0060alla, \u0060perhaps\u0027, comments on the verb describing the action, with what follows it functioning as two direct objects).",
  "Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it: they say, \u0060When will it come?\u0027, as a presumption on their part that it will never come; but those who believe are apprehensive of it and know that it is the truth. Nay, but verily those who are in doubt, those who argue, concerning the Hour are indeed in extreme error!",
  "God is Gracious to His servants, both the pious and the profligate, for He does not destroy them through hunger, despite their acts of disobedience. He provides for whomever He will, from among each of the two [classes of individuals] whatever He will. And He is the Strong, in [effecting] what He wants, the Mighty, Whose way [always] prevails.",
  "And whoever desires, in return for his actions, the harvest of the Hereafter, in other words, its gains, and that is reward, We will enhance for him his harvest, by multiplying in it the good deed up tenfold or more; and whoever desires the harvest of this world, We will give him of it, without multiplying [any of it], [giving him] only what is his [preordained] share; but in the Hereafter he will have no share.",
  "Or have they, the Meccan disbelievers, associates -- these being their devils -- who have prescribed for them, for the disbelievers, a religion, a corrupt [religion], which God has not given permission for?, such as idolatry and denial of resurrection? And were it not for a [prior] decisive word, in other words, a prior decree to the effect that requital will take place on the Day of Resurrection, it would have been judged between them, and the believers, by chastising the former in this world. Truly the wrongdoers, the disbelievers, will have a painful chastisement.",
  "You will see the wrongdoers, on the Day of Resurrection, apprehensive because of what they had earned, in this world, in the way of evil deeds, lest they be requited for these; and it, that is, the requital for these [deeds], will surely befall them, on the Day of Resurrection, inevitably; but those who believe and perform righteous deeds will be in the lushest Gardens, in other words, in the best of these [Gardens] in comparison with the other ones. They will have whatever they wish near their Lord; that is the great favour.",
  "That is the good tidings (read yubshiru or yubashshiru, from bishra, \u0060good news\u0027) which God gives to His servants who believe and perform righteous deeds. Say: \u0060I do not ask of you any reward for it, for delivering the Message, except the affection for [my] kinsfolk (ill, \u0060except\u0027: this represents a discontinuous exception, in other words, \u0060but I do ask of you that you show affection for my kinship [with you], which at the same time is your kinship\u0027; for he [the Prophet] had kinship ties with all the subdivisions of the [tribe of] Quraysh). And whoever acquires a good deed, an act of obedience, We shall enhance for him its goodness, by multiplying [the reward for] it. Surely God is Forgiving, of sins, Appreciative, [even] of little [good], and so He multiplies it [manifold].",
  "Or (am here is like bal) do they say, \u0060He has invented a lie against God?\u0027, in ascribing the Qur\u0027n to God, exalted be He. For if God will, He can seal, He can fortify, your heart, with patience to endure the hurt they cause [you] by such sayings and otherwise -- and God did this. And God will efface the falsehood, which they speak, and vindicate, confirm, the truth with His words, [the ones] revealed to His Prophet. Truly He is Knower of what is in the breasts, of what is in the hearts [of people].",
  "And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants, and pardons evil deeds, those from which repentance has been made, and knows what they do (yaf\u0060alna, may also be read taf\u0060alna, \u0060you do\u0027).",
  "And He answers those who believe and perform righteous deeds, He grants them what they ask for, and He enhances them of His bounty. And as for the disbelievers, for them there will be a severe chastisement.",
  "For were God to extend His provision to His servants, [to] all of them, they would, all of them, surely become covetous, in other words, they would become tyrants, in the earth; but He sends down (read yunzilu or yunazzilu) of provisions, in the measure that He will, thus extending it for some of His servants to the exclusion of others -- and from [such] extending [of provision to some] emerges tyranny. Surely He is Aware, Seer of His servants.",
  "And He it is Who sends down the [saving] rain after they have despaired, [after] they have given up hope of its being sent down, and unfolds His mercy, He extends His rain, and He is the [true] Patron, the Benevolent towards believers, the Praised, by them.",
  "And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and, the creation of, whatever He has scattered, [whatever] He has divided and spread, in them in the way of creatures (dbba: this denotes all those [creatures] which tread [yadubbu] upon the earth, whether human beings or otherwise). And He is able to bring them together, for the Gathering, whenever He will (rational beings as opposed to others predominate in the [suffixed] pronoun [-him of jam\u0060ihim, \u0060to bring them together\u0027]).",
  "And whatever affliction, [whatever] misfortune or hardship, may befall you -- [this is] an address to the believers -- is on account of what your [own] hands have earned, that is to say, [for] the sins that you have committed -- the use of \u0060hands\u0027 to express this is because most actions are effected by them. And He pardons much, of these [sins] and does not requite them, for God\u0027s kindness is greater than that He should [for example] double the requital in the Hereafter; as for those who do not commit [grave] sins, then what befalls them in this world [of hardship] raises their degree in the [reward of the] Hereafter.",
  "And you, O idolaters, cannot escape, from God, by fleeing, on earth, and thus elude Him, and, besides God, that is to say, other than Him, you have neither protector nor helper, to ward off His chastisement from you.",
  "And of His signs are the ships [that run] on the sea [appearing] like landmarks, like mountains, in terms of their magnitude.",
  "If He will, He stills the wind, whereat they remain, they become, motionless, fixed, not moving, on its surface. Surely in that there are signs for every steadfast, grateful [servant] -- this is the believer, who is steadfast during hardship and grateful in [times of] comfort.",
  "Or He wrecks them (ybiqhunna, a supplement to yuskin, \u0060He stills\u0027), that is to say, [or] He sinks them, including their passengers, by sending violent winds [upon them], because of what they, that is, the passengers of these [ships], have earned, of sins. And He pardons much, of such [sin] and does not cause those who have sinned to drown.",
  "And that those who dispute concerning Our signs may know (read [indicative] wa-ya\u0060lamu, \u0060and [they] know\u0027, beginning a new sentence; or [subjunctive] wa-ya\u0060lama, \u0060and that [they] may know\u0027, as a supplement to an implicit reason, in other words: \u0060He drowns them in order to exact vengeance against them and so that they may know that ...\u0027) they have no refuge, no escape from the chastisement (the negation represents two direct objects of [the verb] ya\u0060lamu [or ya\u0060lama], \u0060[they] know\u0027; the negation is also a comment on the [implied] action [of \u0060escaping\u0027]).",
  "So whatever you -- [this is] an address is to believers and others -- have been given, of the luxuries of this world, is [but] the enjoyment of the life of this world, enjoyed for the duration of it but then perishes. But what is with God, of reward, is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord (li\u0027lladhna man wa-\u0060al rabbihim yatawakkalna, is supplemented by [the following clause]),",
  "and those who avoid grave sins and indecencies, those [acts] that require [the implementing of] the prescribed legal punishments (hudd) ([the supplement above is] an example of supplementing the part to the whole) and [who], when they are angry, forgive, they let it pass;",
  "and those who answer their Lord, [those who] respond to what He has summoned them in the way of affirming His Oneness and worship [of Him], and observe prayer, maintaining it regularly, and whose courses of action, those [courses of action] that seem good to them, are [a matter of] counsel between them, in which they consult one another and do not act hastily, and who, of what We have bestowed on them, expend, in obedience to God -- such mentioned [individuals] constitute one category;",
  "and those who, when they suffer aggression, injustice, defend themselves -- these are another category -- that is to say, they retaliate against those who wrong them in the same manner in which the latter wronged them, as God, exalted be He, says:",
  "For the requital of an evil deed is an evil deed like it: the latter is [also] referred to as \u0060an evil deed\u0027 because in [outward] form it resembles the former; this is evident in what concerns retaliation for wounds. Some [scholars] say that even if another were to say, \u0060May God disgrace you!\u0027, then one should respond [equally] with, \u0060May God disgrace you!\u0027. But whoever pardons, his wrongdoer, and reconciles, the amity between himself and the one pardoned, his reward will be with God, that is to say, God will give him his reward without doubt. Truly He does not like wrongdoers, that is, those who initiate acts of wrongdoing and so merit His punishment.",
  "And whoever defends himself after he has been wronged, that is to say, after the wrongdoer has wronged him -- for such, there will be no course [of action] against them, no blame [on them].",
  "A course [of action] is only [open] against those who wrong people and seek [to commit], [who] commit, in the earth what is not right, [what are] acts of disobedience. For such there will be a painful chastisement.",
  "But verily he who is patient, and defend himself [by retaliating], and forgives, excuses [the wrong done to him] -- surely that, patience and excusing, is [true] constancy in [such] affairs, that is to say, it is one of those [courses of action] for which one must have firm resolve, meaning those which are required [of the believer] by [God\u0027s] Law.",
  "And whomever God leads astray has no protector after Him, that is to say, none to take charge of guiding him after God has led him astray. And you will see the wrongdoers, when they sight the chastisement, saying, \u0060Is there any way, any route [by which], to return?\u0027, to this world.",
  "And you will see them being exposed to it, namely, the Fire, submissive, fearful and humbled, by abasement, looking, at it, with a furtive glance, a slight look, stealthily (min [of min tarfin khafiyyin, \u0060with a furtive glance\u0027] is to indicate inceptiveness, or it functions with the sense of a b\u0027, \u0060with\u0027 [sc. bi-tarfin khafiyyin]). And those who believe will say, \u0060Verily the [true] losers are those who have lost themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection, for being condemned to abide forever in the Fire and for not being able to attain [the blissful company of] the houris prepared for them in Paradise had they been believers (the relative clause [alladhna khasir ..., \u0060those who have lost ...\u0027] constitutes the predicate of the particle inna, \u0060verily\u0027). Truly the wrongdoers, the disbelievers, will be in lasting, everlasting, chastisement -- these [words] constitute God\u0027s speech, exalted be He.",
  "And they have no guardians to help them besides God, that is to say, other than Him, to ward off His chastisement from them, and whomever God leads astray has no course [of action]\u0027, no route to the truth in this world or to Paradise in the Hereafter.",
  "Answer your Lord, respond to Him by affirming His Oneness and worshipping [Him], before there comes a day, namely, the Day of Resurrection, for which there is no revoking from God, in other words, one which when He brings about He will not revoke. On that day you will have no refuge, in which to seek refuge in, and for you there will be no [way of] denying, your sins.",
  "But if they are disregardful, of answering [God], We have not sent you as a keeper over them, to keep [track of] their deeds by securing what is demanded of them. Your duty is only to deliver the Message -- this was [revealed] before the command to struggle [against them]. And indeed when We let man taste from Us some mercy, some grace, such as wealth and good health, he exults in it; but if some ill, [some] calamity, befalls them (the pronoun here refers to \u0060man\u0027, on the basis of the [plural import of the] generic noun) because of what their [own] hands have sent ahead, [because of what] they have offered [of deeds] -- the expression refers to \u0060the hands\u0027 because most actions are effected by them), then lo! man is ungrateful, for the grace.",
  "To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates whatever He will; He gives to whomever He will, in the way of children, females, and He gives to whomever He will males.",
  "Or He combines them, that is to say, [or] He makes them, males and females; and He makes whomever He will infertile, such that she is unable to conceive or he cannot have a child. Surely He is Knower, of what He creates, Powerful, in [bringing about] whatever He will.",
  "And it is not [possible] for any human that God should speak to him except, that He should reveal to him, by revelation, in sleep or by inspiration, or, except, from behind a veil, where He makes the person able to hear His speech but without seeing Him -- as was the case with Moses, peace be upon him; or, except, that He should send a messenger, an angel, such as Gabriel, and he, the messenger, then reveals, to the person to whom he has been sent, that is to say, [and then] he speaks to him, with His permission, that is, God\u0027s, whatever He, God, will. Truly He is Exalted, above the attributes of created beings, Wise, in His actions.",
  "And thus, in the same way that We have revealed to messengers other than you, have We revealed to you, O Muhammad (s), a Spirit, namely, the Qur\u0027n, by which hearts are revived, from Our command, that [command] which We reveal to you. You did not know, before revelation came to you, what the Book was, [what] the Qur\u0027n [was], nor faith, that is, its ordinances and [ritual] ceremonies (the negation comments in place of the verb on the action, and what has come after it constitutes two direct objects); but We have made it, namely, the Spirit -- or the Qur\u0027n -- a light by which We guide whomever We will of Our servants. And verily you guide, you are summoning [people], by means of what is revealed to you, to a straight path, [a straight] way: the religion of Islam,",
  "the path of God, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants. Surely with God all matters end [their journey], [all matters] return. Meccan [entirely], or as some say [Meccan] with the exception of verse 45, which is Medinese; it consists of 89 verses, revealed after [srat] al-Shr.",
  "H mm: God knows best what He means by these [letters].",
  "By the Book, the Qur\u0027n, that clarifies, the one that manifests the path of guidance and what one needs of [the prescriptions of] the Law.",
  "Lo! We have made it, We have brought the Book into existence [as], an Arabic Qur\u0027n, in the language of the Arabs, that perhaps you, O people of Mecca, may understand, [that you may] comprehend its meanings.",
  "And it is indeed, fixed, in the Mother Book, the source of all the scriptures, namely, the Preserved Tablet, [which is] with Us (ladayn substitutes [for f ummi\u0027l-kitbi, \u0060in the Mother Book\u0027]) [and it is] indeed exalted, above [all] the scriptures [that came] before it, wise, containing excellent wisdoms.",
  "Shall We turn away, [shall We] withhold, from you the Remembrance, the Qur\u0027n, utterly, an utter withholding, so that you are then neither commanded nor forbidden, because you are a profligate, an idolatrous, folk? No!",
  "And how many a prophet did We send among the ancients!",
  "And never did a prophet come to them but that they used to deride him, in the same way that your people deride you -- this [statement] is intended to comfort the Prophet (s).",
  "So We destroyed those who were mightier than them -- than your people -- in prowess, strength, and [already] there passed, there has been mentioned in previous verses, the example of the ancients, the description of how they were destroyed, and thus the sequel for your people will be the same.",
  "And if (wa-la-in: the lm is for oaths) you ask them, \u0060Who created the heavens and the earth?\u0027 they will surely say (the indicative nn has been omitted because of the other nn coming after it, and likewise the ww [replaced by the damma in -lunna], because of two unvowelled consonants coming together), \u0060The Mighty, the Knower created them\u0027 -- [this would have to be] their eventual response, that is to say, God [created them], Lord of Might and Knowledge. God, exalted be He, adds:",
  "He Who made the earth a cradle for you, a flat resting-place, like a child\u0027s cradle, and placed for you therein ways, routes, that perhaps you may be guided, to your destinations during your travels;",
  "and Who sent down water from the heaven in measure, that is to say, in the measure that you require thereof and did not send it down in a deluge, and We revived with it a dead land. Thus -- like this revivification -- will you be brought forth, from your graves, alive;",
  "and Who created the pairs, the species, all of them, and made for you ships and cattle, such as camels, on which you ride (the referential pronoun has been omitted here for brevity; it is genitive in the case of the first, that is, fhi [sc. tarkabna fhi, \u0060you ride in them\u0027] and accusative in the case of the second [sc. tarkabnah, \u0060you ride them\u0027]),",
  "that you may sit, that you may find a firm position, upon their backs (He has made the [suffixed] pronoun a masculine plural and rendered zahr, \u0060back\u0027, plural because of the particle m and its [plural] import); and then remember your Lord\u0027s grace when you are settled on them, and say, \u0060Glory be to Him Who has disposed this for us, and we [by] ourselves were no match for it, [not] capable [of it].",
  "And indeed it is to our Lord that we shall return\u0027, [to Him that] we shall depart.",
  "And they assign to Him from among His own servants a part, when they say that the angels are God\u0027s daughters -- for a child is a part of its parent -- even though the angels are [like them] servants of His, exalted be He. Man, [such as the one] who says the above-mentioned [words], is verily a manifest ingrate, one whose ungratefulness is manifest and clear.",
  "Or (am has the significance of the hamza of denial; the \u0060saying\u0027 is implied, in other words, a-taqlna, \u0060[or] do you say that ...\u0027) He has adopted, from all that He has created, daughters, for Himself, and preferred you, privileged you, with sons? -- that which is the necessary inference from what you claim and which by itself is an abomination.",
  "And when one of them is given the good tidings of that which he has attributed to the Compassionate One, [of that which] he has likened to Him by the ascription to Him of daughters -- for a child is likened to its parent; in other words, when one of them is informed that a daughter has been born to him, his face becomes darkened, transformed into one laden with anguish, and he chokes inwardly, filled with anguish: so how can such a person then attribute daughters to Him? Exalted be He high above such [claims].",
  "What! (a-wa contains both the hamza of denial and the conjunctive waw, \u0060and\u0027, in other words, \u0060do they ascribe to God ...\u0027) one that is brought up amid trinkets, ornaments, and is incoherent in a dispute?, [unable] to argue clearly because of an [inherent] inability [in this respect] as a result of [that person belonging to] the female sex.",
  "And they have made the angels, who are themselves servants of the Compassionate One, females. Did they witness, were they present at, their creation? Their testimony, to the effect that they are females, will be written down and they will be questioned, about it in the Hereafter, wherefore punishment will ensue for them.",
  "And they say, \u0060Had the Compassionate One [so] willed, we would not have worshipped them\u0027, the angels: therefore our worship of them happens by His will and so He must be satisfied with it. God, exalted be He, says: They do not have any knowledge of that, which is said of His being satisfied with the worship of these [angels]; and they are only surmising, inventing lies in this [respect] and so punishment will befall them as a result thereof.",
  "Or have We brought them a scripture before, that is, [before] the Qur\u0027n, that they should worship other than God, so that they are holding fast to it? In other words, this never happened.",
  "Nay, but they say, \u0060Lo! we found our fathers following a [certain] creed and we are indeed, proceeding, in their footsteps to be guided\u0027, by them, for they used to worship other than God.",
  "And thus We never sent a warner before you into any city without that its affluent folk, those of comfortable means, said, the like of what your people say: \u0060Lo! we found our fathers following a [certain] creed and [so] we are indeed following in their footsteps\u0027.",
  "Say, to them: \u0060What! Will you follow them, even if I bring you a better [means to] guidance than what you found your fathers following?\u0027 They say, \u0060Lo! we disbelieve in what you, and those before you, are sent with\u0027. God, exalted be He, says to them, as a threat to them:",
  "So We took vengeance on them, that is to say, on those who denied the messengers before you; behold then how was the sequel for the deniers.",
  "And, mention, when Abraham said to his father and his people, \u0060Surely I am innocent of that which you worship,",
  "except Him Who originated, created, me; for He will indeed guide me\u0027, He will show me the way to His religion.",
  "And he made it, namely, the statement of the affirmation of [God\u0027s] Oneness, understood from his words, I shall indeed depart to my Lord; He will guide me [Q. 37:99], a word enduring among his posterity, his descendants, and thus there still remains among them those who affirm the Oneness of [God]; that perhaps they, that is, the people of Mecca, might recant, what they follow [and return] to the religion of their forefather Abraham.",
  "Nay, but I have let these, idolaters, and their fathers enjoy [life], without hastening to punish them, until there came to them the truth, the Qur\u0027n, and a messenger who makes [things] clear, one who manifests to them the stipulations of the Law -- and this [messenger] is Muhammad (s).",
  "But when the truth, the Qur\u0027n, came to them, they said, \u0060This is sorcery, and we are indeed disbelievers in it\u0027.",
  "And they said, \u0060If only this Qur\u0027n had been revealed to some great man from, the inhabitants of, the two towns!\u0027, in other words, from either of the two; such as al-Wald b. al-Mughra at Mecca or \u0060Urwa b. Mas\u0060d al-Thaqaf at T\u0027if.",
  "Is it they who apportion the mercy of your Lord?, [the mercy being] prophethood. We have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world, making some of them wealthy and others poor, and raised some of them, in wealth, above others by degrees, so that some of them, who are wealthy, may take others, who are poor, in service, disposed to work for them in return for a wage (the [final] y\u0027 [in sukhriyy] is attributive; a variant reading has sikhriyyan); and the mercy of your Lord, that is, Paradise, is better than what they amass, in this world.",
  "And were it not [for the danger] that mankind would be one community, following disbelief, We would have made, for those who disbelieve in the Compassionate One, roofs (read saqfan, or plural suqufan) of silver for their houses (li-buytihim substitutes for li-man, \u0060for those who\u0027) and stairs, such as steps, [also] of silver, by which they ascend, [by which] they go up to the roof;",
  "and doors, of silver, for their houses, and, We would have made for them, couches, of silver (surur, \u0060couches\u0027, is the plural of sarr) on which they recline,",
  "and ornaments, gold: in other words, were it not for fear that a believer might disbelieve as a result of Our giving the disbeliever what has been mentioned, We would have given him such [luxuries], since the [affairs of this] world represent no danger to Us and he [the disbeliever] would then have no share in the Bliss of the Hereafter. Yet surely (wa-in: in is softened from the hardened form [inna]) all that would be nothing (read lam, with the m as extra; or read lamm to mean \u0060but\u0027, making the particle in for negation) but the [transient] enjoyment of the life of this world, enjoyed during it, but then perishes, and the Hereafter, Paradise, with your Lord is for the God-fearing.",
  "And whoever withdraws from, [whoever] is oblivious, to the Remembrance of the Compassionate One, namely, the Qur\u0027n, We assign, We produce, for him a devil and he becomes his companion, never leaving his side.",
  "And indeed they, that is, the devils, bar them, the blind, from the way, [from] the path of guidance, while they suppose that they are [rightly] guided (the plural [muhtadna] takes into account the [potentially plural] sense of man, \u0060whoever\u0027, [of the previous verse]),",
  "until when he comes to Us, such a blind one, together with his companion, on the Day of Resurrection, he says, to him: \u0060O (y is for calling attention) would that there were between me and you the distance of the two easts!\u0027, that is to say, like the distance between the east and the west, What an evil companion then!, you are for me. God, exalted be He, says:",
  "And it, your wishes or your remorse, will not benefit you, blind ones, this day, given that you did wrong, that is to say, [given that] it has become clear to you that you were wrongdoers, through your idolatry in this world, that you, together with your companions, will be sharing in the chastisement (this constitutes the justification, on the basis of an implied lm [sc. li-annakum ...], for the \u0060lack of benefit\u0027; idh substitutes for al- yawma, \u0060this day\u0027).",
  "Can you, then, make the deaf hear, or can you guide the blind and one who is in manifest error?, in other words, such [individuals] will not believe.",
  "So if (fa-imm: the conditional particle in has been assimilated herein with an extra m) We take you away, by making you die before chastising them, then We will take vengeance on them, in the Hereafter;",
  "or We show you, during your lifetime, that which We have promised them, in the way of chastisement, for surely We have power over, [surely] We are able to chastise, them.",
  "So hold fast to that which has been revealed to you, namely, the Qur\u0027n; surely you are on a straight path, [a straight] way.",
  "And it is indeed a Reminder, an honour, for you and for your people, as it has been revealed in their language. And you will [eventually] be questioned, about [the extent of] your fulfilling your duty towards it.",
  "And ask those of Our messengers whom We sent before you: Did We [ever] appoint, besides the Compassionate One, that is to say, [any] other than Him, gods to be worshipped? It is said that this is to be understood literally, in other words, that God gathered for him all the messengers on the Night [of the] Journey; but it is also said that this meant [that he should ask] any communities belonging to either of the two Peoples of the Scripture. According to one of the two opinions, he never asked [anyone] since the point of this command to ask is to affirm to the idolaters of Quraysh that no messenger or scripture ever came from God with the command to worship [any] other than God.",
  "And verily We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his council, namely, the Egyptians (al-Qibt), and he said, \u0060I am indeed the messenger of the Lord of the Worlds\u0027.",
  "But when he brought them Our signs, those proving his mission [from God], behold! they laughed at them.",
  "And We never showed them a sign, from among the signs of chastisement, such as the flood, which was when the waters [of the Nile] penetrated their dwellings and for seven days rose as high as their throats as they sat, or [the chastisement of] the locusts, but it was greater than the one before it, the one immediately preceding it. And We seized them with chastisement, that perhaps they might recant, their disbelief.",
  "And they said, to Moses, upon seeing the chastisement, \u0060O sorcerer! -- that is to say, \u0060[O] knowledgeable, perfect one\u0027, since for them sorcery was an awesome [form of] knowledge -- supplicate your Lord for us by the covenant that He has made with you, [to the effect] that He would relieve us from chastisement if we believe. Assuredly we will be guided\u0027, that is to say, [we will become] believers.",
  "But as soon as We relieved them, by the supplication of Moses, from the chastisement, behold! they had broken their pledge, reneging on their covenant and persisting in their disbelief.",
  "And Pharaoh proclaimed, boastfully, among his people, \u0060O my people, does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me, and these rivers, of the Nile, flowing beneath me?, that is to say, beneath my palaces. Do you not perceive?, my magnificence.",
  "Or, do you perceive, in which case, am I not better than this one, namely, Moses, who is contemptible, feeble and lowly, and who can scarcely speak clearly?, [who can scarcely] articulate his speech, because of his lisp -- which was the result of his [accidentally] placing a hot coal in his mouth when he was a child.",
  "Why then, if he were being truthful, have bracelets of gold (aswira, is the plural of aswira, which is the plural of siwr, similar [in pattern] to [ghurb] aghriba) not been cast on him -- as according to their custom with those whom they made their leaders, dressing them with gold bracelets and gold necklaces -- or the angels not come with him one after the other?\u0027, in succession, to testify to his truthfulness.",
  "Thus did he, Pharaoh, persuade, incite, his people and they obeyed him, in his wish that Moses be denied. They were truly an immoral folk.",
  "So when they had angered Us, We took vengeance on them and drowned them all.",
  "And We made them a thing past (salaf, is the plural of slif, similar [in pattern] to khdim, khadam) that is to say, a precedent, as a lesson, and an example for others, after them, that they [posterity] might take their predicament as a lesson and so not engage in actions similar to theirs.",
  "And when the son of Mary is cited as an example -- after God\u0027s [following] words were revealed: \u0060Truly you and what you worship besides God shall be fuel for Hell\u0027 [Q. 21:98] and the idolaters said, \u0060We are satisfied that our gods be together with Jesus [in Hell], for he too was worshipped besides God\u0027 -- behold! your people, that is, the idolaters, laugh at it, at this example -- they clamour with joy at what they hear.",
  "And they say, \u0060Are our gods better or he?\u0027, Jesus. We are satisfied that our gods be [in the same predicament] with him. They only cite this, that is, the example, to you for the sake of contention, [merely] arguing with falsehood, for they know that [the particle] m [of wa-m ta\u0060budna, \u0060and what you worship\u0027] refers [only] to non-rational beings and cannot therefore include Jesus, peace be upon him. Nay, but they are a contentious lot, an extremely disputatious folk.",
  "He, Jesus, is only a servant [of Ours] on whom We bestowed favour, through prophethood, and We made him, by his [coming into] being without a father, an exemplar for the Children of Israel, that is to say, like an example because of the wondrousness of his case, one from which one is able to infer God\u0027s power, exalted be He, to do whatever He will.",
  "And had We willed, We would have appointed among you, instead of you, angels to be [your] successors in the earth, by Our destroying you.",

So in what [kind of] discourse then, after God, that is to say, [after] His discourse, namely, the Qur\u0027n, and His signs, His definitive arguments, will they, that is, the disbelievers of Mecca, believe?

  "And verily We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, the Torah, and [the means of] judgement, therewith between people, and prophethood, for Moses and Aaron among them, and We provided them with the good things, the lawful things, such as manna and quails, and We favoured them above [all] worlds, the worlds of their time, [that is, above all other] rational beings.",
  "And We gave them clear illustrations of the commandment, the commandment of religion, in the way of what is lawful or unlawful, and the Mission of Muhammad (s), upon whom be the most excellent blessings and peace. And they did not differ, regarding his Mission, except after the knowledge had come to them, out of rivalry among themselves, that is to say, because of some rivalry that came about among them, out of envy of him. Surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that in which they used to differ.",

  "Or (am has the significance of the [rhetorical] hamza of denial) do those who have perpetrated evil acts, [such as] disbelief and disobedience, suppose that We shall treat them as those who believe and perform righteous deeds, equally (saw\u0027an is the predicate) in their life and in their death? (mahyhum wa- mamtuhum, [this clause] constitutes the subject and a supplement; the sentence [itself] is a substitution for the kf [of ka\u0027lladhna, \u0060as those\u0027], and both [suffixed] pronouns [-hum] refer to the disbelievers). The meaning is: do they suppose that in the Hereafter We will assign them [a] good [fate] like believers, [that they will enjoy] a life of plenty, one equal to their life in this world, as when they said to the believers: \u0060Surely if we were to be resurrected, we will be given the same good things that you will be given!\u0027 God, exalted be He, says, in accordance with His denial [implicit] in the [rhetorical interrogative] hamza: How evil is that judgement which they make! In other words, it will not be so, for in the Hereafter they will be [suffering] in the chastisement, in contrast to their lives in this world; the believers, on the other hand, will be [delighting] in the Reward in the Hereafter because of their righteous deeds in this world, such as [their observance of] prayers, [their] alms-giving, fasting and otherwise (the m, \u0060that ... which\u0027, relates to the verbal action, that is to say, ba\u0027isa hukman hukmuhum hdh, \u0060awful as a judgement is this judgement of theirs\u0027).",
  "And God created the heavens and, He created, the earth with the truth (bi\u0027l-haqqi is semantically connected to khalaqa, \u0060He created\u0027), so that He may indicate His power and His Oneness, and so that every soul may be requited for what it has earned, in the way of acts of disobedience or obedience, and therefore the disbeliever cannot be equal to the believer, and they will not be wronged.",
  "Have you then seen, inform Me [about], him who has taken as his god his [own] desire, [that is] whatever [new] stone he may desire after [having desired] some other stone, considering this [new one] to be better, and whom God has led astray knowingly, on His part, exalted be He, that is to say, knowing him to be of those who follow misguidance before he was created, and set a seal upon his hearing and his heart, so that he cannot hear guidance or understand it, and laid a covering, a darkness, over his sight?, so that he cannot perceive guidance (here one should understand as implied the second direct object of [the verb] a-ra\u0027ayta, \u0060have you seen\u0027, namely: a-yahtad, \u0060can he find guidance?). So who will guide him after God?, that is to say, after His leading him astray? In other words, he will not find guidance. Will you not then remember?, [will you not then] be admonished? (tadhakkarna: one of the two t\u0027 letters [of the original form tatadhakkarna] has been assimilated with the dhl).",
  "And they, those who deny the Resurrection, say, \u0060There is only, that is to say, [the only] life [is], our life, the one that is, in this world. We die and we live, that is to say, some die, while others are given life by [virtue of] being born, and nothing but time, that is, [nothing but] the passage of time, destroys us\u0027. God, exalted be He, says: Of that, saying, they have no knowledge; they are only making conjectures.",
  "And when Our signs, of the Qur\u0027n, indicating Our power to resurrect, are recited to them, being clear signs, evident [signs] (bayyintin, \u0060clear signs\u0027, is a circumstantial qualifier), their only argument is to say, \u0060Bring us our fathers, alive, if you are being truthful\u0027, [when you say] that we will be resurrected.",
  "Say: \u0060God [is the One Who] gives you life, when you are sperm-drops, then makes you die, then gathers you, alive, to the Day of Resurrection, in which there is no doubt; but most people, and these are the one who say the above-mentioned, do not know\u0027.",
  "And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And on the day when the Hour sets in (yawma taqmu\u0027l-s\u0060atu is substituted by [the following, yawma\u0027idhin]) on that day the followers of falsehood, the disbelievers, will be losers, that is to say, their loss will become manifest by their ending up in the Fire.",
  "And you will see every community, that is, [all] members of a religion, crouching, on their knees -- or [jthiya means] \u0060gathered together\u0027. Every community will be summoned to its record, the record of its deeds and it will be said to them: \u0060Today you will be requited for what you used to do, that is, [you will be given] the desert thereof.",
  "This is Our book, the register of [deeds recorded by] the guardian angels, which pronounces against you with truth. Indeed We used to write down, record and preserve, what you used to do\u0027.",
  "So as for those who believed and performed righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them into His mercy, His Paradise. That is the manifest triumph, the clear and evident [triumph].",
  "But as for those who disbelieved, it will be said to them: \u0060Were not My signs, [was not] the Qur\u0027n, recited to you, but you were disdainful, you were arrogant, and were a guilty, a disbelieving, lot?",
  "And when it was said, to you, O disbelievers: \u0022God\u0027s promise, of resurrection, is indeed true, and there is no doubt about the Hour\u0022, (read al-s\u0060atu or al-s\u0060ata) you said, \u0022We do not know what the Hour is. We only make conjectures (al-Mubarrad said that this actually [means] in nahnu ill nazunnu zannan) and we are by no means certain\u0022 \u0027, that it will come to pass.",
  "And there will appear before them, in the Hereafter, the evils of what they did, in this world, that is to say, the requital thereof, and they will be besieged by, there shall befall [them], what they used to deride, namely, the chastisement [of the Hereafter].",
  "And it will be said: \u0060Today We will forget you, We will abandon you in the Fire, just as you forgot the encounter of this day of yours, that is to say, [just as] you neglected to perform [those good] deeds [in preparation] for the encounter with it, and your abode will be the Fire, and you will not have any helpers, [any] protectors therefrom.",
  "That is because you took God\u0027s signs, the Qur\u0027n, in mockery, and the life of this world deceived you\u0027, to the extent that you said, \u0060There is neither Resurrection nor Reckoning\u0027. So today they will not be brought out (read either active yakhrujna, \u0060they will [not] come out\u0027, or passive yukhrajna, \u0060they will [not] be brought out\u0027) of it, of the Fire, nor will they asked to make amends: they will not be asked to [try to] attain the pleasure of their Lord by repenting or being obedient, for such [action] will be of no use then.",
  "So to God belongs [all] praise, the attribution to Him of what is beautiful [in words] for fulfilling His promise regarding the deniers; Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, the Lord of the Worlds, the Creator of all that has been mentioned (\u0060lam, \u0060world\u0027, denotes everything other than God; it is in the plural [\u0060lamn] because of the different types [of beings] in them; rabbi, \u0060Lord\u0027, [in the last clause] is a substitution [for the previous ones]).",
  "And to Him belongs [all] grandeur, [all] majesty, in the heavens and the earth (f\u0027l-samwti wa\u0027l-ardi is a circumstantial qualifier), and He is the Mighty, the Wise -- as [explained in a similar statement] above. Meccan, except for verses 10,15 and 35, which are Medinese; it consists of 34 or 35 verses.",

Show me -- inform me -- (arn, [repeated] for emphasis), what they have created (mdh khalaq, the second object) of the earth (mina\u0027l- ardi, the explication of m, \u0060what [part]\u0027). Or do they have any share, any partnership, in, the creation of, the heavens?, with God? (am, \u0060or\u0027, has the significance of the [rhetorical interrogative] hamza of denial). Bring me a scripture, [that has been] revealed, before this, Qur\u0027n, or some vestige, some remnant, of knowledge, transmitted from the ancients confirming the soundness of your claim that your worship of the idols brings you closer to God, if you are truthful\u0027, in your claim.",

Say: \u0060If I have invented it, hypothetically [speaking], still you would have no power to avail me against God, that is to say, against His chastisement, in any way, in other words, you would not be able to ward it off from me if God chooses to chastise me.

Already many of them have come before me, so how can you deny me? Nor do I know what will be done with me or with you, in this world: will I be made to leave my [native] land, or will I be slain as was done with [some] prophets before me, or will you stone me to death, or will the earth be made to swallow you as [it did] deniers before you? I only follow what is revealed to me, that is, the Qur\u0027n, and I do not invent anything myself. And I am only a plain warner\u0027, one whose warning is plain.",

  "Yet before it, that is, [before] the Qur\u0027n, [there was] the Book of Moses, that is, the Torah, as a guidepost and a mercy, for those who believed in it (imman wa-rahmatan are two circumstantial qualifiers) and this, Qur\u0027n, is a Book that confirms, scriptures before it, in the Arabic tongue (lisnan \u0060arabiyyan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of musaddiqun, \u0060that confirms\u0027) to warn those who do wrong, the idolaters of Mecca, and, it is, good tidings for the virtuous, the believers.",
  "Assuredly those who say, \u0060Our Lord is God\u0027 and then remain upright, in [their adherence to] obedience, no fear will befall them, nor will they grieve.",
  "Those will be the inhabitants of Paradise, abiding therein (khlidna fh is a circumstantial qualifier) as a reward (jaz\u0027an is in the accusative as a verbal noun, because of the implied verbal action, that is to say, yujzawna, \u0060they will be rewarded\u0027) for what they used to do.",
  "And We have enjoined man to be kind (husnan: a variant reading has ihsnan), that is to say, We have commanded him to act kindly towards both of them (thus ihsnan is in the accusative as a verbal noun, because of the implied verbal action; the same applies to husnan) to his parents. His mother carries him in travail, and gives birth to him in travail, that is to say, with suffering; and his gestation and his weaning, from suckling, take thirty months, six months being the minimum period for gestation, the remainder being the maximum period of suckling; it is also said that, regardless of whether she bore him for six or nine months, she should suckle him for the remainder. So that (hatt is a [particle of] purpose for an implied sentence, that is to say, wa-\u0060sha hatt, \u0060and he lived on so that ...\u0027) when he is mature, namely, at his prime in terms of his strength, intellect and reasoning, the minimum [age] for which is thirty or thirty three years, and reaches forty years, that is, exactly [forty years], which is the maximum for [attaining] maturity, he says, \u0060My Lord!, [this] to the end [of this verse] was revealed regarding Ab Bakr al-Siddq, when he had reached forty years of age, two years after the [beginning of the] Prophet\u0027s Mission (s). He [Ab Bakr] believed in him, whereafter his parents believed [in the Prophet], followed by his son \u0060Abd al-Rahmn, then \u0060Abd al-Rahmn\u0027s son Ab \u0060Atq [Muhammad b. \u0060Abd al-Rahmn]. Inspire me to give thanks for Your favour with which You have favoured me and my parents, namely, [the grace of] affirming [God\u0027s] Oneness, and that I may act righteously in a way that will please You, thus he [Ab Bakr] emancipated nine believers who had been enduring torture [at the hands of the idolaters] for [their belief in] God, and invest my seed with righteousness, all of them were believers. Indeed I repent to You and I am truly of those who submit [to You]\u0027.",
  "Those, that is, those who say such words, Ab Bakr and others, are they from whom We accept the best of what they do, and overlook their misdeeds, [as they stand] among the inhabitants of Paradise (f ashbi\u0027ll- jannati, a circumstantial qualifier, in other words, \u0060being among them\u0027) -- [this is] the true promise which they were promised, by His words, God has promised the believers, both men and women, Gardens ... [Q. 9:72].",

Do you threaten me (a-ta\u0060idnin: a variant reading has a- ta\u0060idnn) that I shall be raised, from the grave, when already generations, communities, have passed away before me?\u0027, and they have not been raised from their graves. And they call on God for succour, that he [their child] repent, saying [to him]: if you do not repent, \u0060Woe to you (waylaka, that is to say, halkaka, \u0060you are ruined!\u0027). Believe!, in resurrection. Surely God\u0027s promise is true\u0027. But he says, \u0060This, belief in resurrection, is nothing but the fables of the ancients\u0027, lies of theirs.",
  "Such are the ones against whom the Word, of chastisement, is due, is necessary, concerning communities of jinn and humans that have passed away before them. Truly they are losers.",
  "And for each one, of both categories, believer and disbeliever, there will be degrees [of status] , thus the degrees of the believers in Paradise are high, while the degrees of disbelievers in the Fire are despicable, according to what they have done, that is to say, [according to what] believers [have done] in the way of acts of obedience, and disbelievers, in the way of acts of disobedience, and that He may recompense them fully, namely, God (li-yuwaffiyahum: a variant reading has li-nuwaffiyahum, \u0060that We may recompense them fully\u0027) for their deeds, that is, [pay them] their deserts, and they will not be wronged, [not even] in a single thing that may be diminished for believers or increased for disbelievers.",
  "And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire, by its being revealed for them, it will be said to them: \u0060You squandered (read with one hamza, adhhabtum, or with two hamzas [as an interrogative], a-adhhabtum, \u0060have you sqaundered ...?\u0027; or with one hamza, adhhabtum, or with an initial long \u0060a\u0027, dhhabtum, with both of these [pronounced fully] or without pronouncing the second [hamza]) your good things during your life of the world, by preoccupying yourselves with sensual delights, and enjoyed them. So today you will be requited with the chastisement of humiliation in return for acting arrogantly in the earth without right and in return for that regarding which you used to act immorally\u0027, and [for] the torture you used to inflict [upon others] therein.",
  "And mention the brother of \u0060d, namely, Hd, peace be upon him, when (idh ... [from here] to the end [of the verse] constitutes an inclusive substitution) he warned his people, he threatened them, at Ahqf, [\u0060the Sand dunes\u0027 is the name of] a valley in Yemen, where their dwellings were located -- and already warners, messengers, had passed away before him and after him, that is to say, before Hd [came to them] and after him, to their peoples -- saying, \u0060Do not worship anyone but God (the statement [beginning with] wa-qad khalat, \u0060and already [warners] had passed away\u0027, is a parenthetical one). Truly I fear for you -- should you worship other than God -- the chastisement of a dreadful day\u0027.",
  "They said, \u0060Have you come to divert us from our gods?, to turn us away from worship of them. Then bring us what you threaten us with, of chastisement for worshipping them, if you are of the truthful\u0027, in [saying] that it will befall us.",
  "He, Hd, said, \u0060The knowledge is with God only, He is the One Who knows when chastisement will befall you, and I am [merely] conveying to you what I have been sent with, to you. But I see that you are an ignorant lot\u0027, given your hastening on of the chastisement.",
  "Then, when they saw it, that is, [when they saw] what chastisement [really] was, as a sudden cloud, a cloud that appeared [out of nowhere] on the horizon, heading towards their valleys, they said, \u0060This is a cloud that will bring us rain!\u0027. God, exalted be He, says: Nay, but it is what you sought to hasten, of the chastisement -- a hurricane (rhun substitutes for m, \u0060what\u0027) containing a painful chastisement,",
  "destroying, ruining, everything, it passes through, by the command of its Lord, by His will, that is to say, [destroying] everything that He wants to destroy with it. And so it destroyed their men, women, children and properties by flinging them up into the air high above the ground and tearing them to pieces. Only Hd and those who believed with him remained [unscathed]. So they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings. Thus, in the way that We requited them, do We requite guilty folk, besides them.",
  "And verily We had empowered them in ways in which We have not (in is either for negation or extra) empowered you, O people of Mecca, in the way of strength and means, and We had vested them with ears and eyes and hearts. But their ears and their eyes and their hearts did not avail them in any way (min shay\u0027in: min is extra) since (idh, is operated by aghn, \u0060avail\u0027, and imbued with the sense of [a particle introducing a] reason) they used to deny the signs of God, His clear proofs, and they were besieged by, there befell them, what they used to deride, of chastisement.",
  "And We certainly destroyed the towns [that were] around you, that is, [We destroyed] their inhabitants, the likes of Thamd, \u0060d and the people of Lot, and We dispensed the signs, We repeated the clear proofs, so that perhaps they might return.",
  "So why did they not help them, by averting from them the chastisement, those whom they had chosen besides God, that is to say, other than Him, as [a means of] nearness, through whom they may secure nearness to God, to be gods?, alongside Him, and these are the idols (the first object of ittakhadh, \u0060they had chosen\u0027, is the omitted pronoun referred to by the relative clause [alladhna, \u0060those who ...\u0027], and it is hum, \u0060they\u0027; qurbnan, \u0060nearness\u0027, is the second [object], with lihatan, \u0060gods\u0027, as its substitution). Nay, but they forsook them, when the chastisement came down [on them], and that, that is to say, [that] choosing of theirs of idols as gods as a means of nearness [to God], was their lie and what they used to invent -- the lies they used to speak (m, \u0060what\u0027, either relates to the verbal action [\u0060their lying\u0027], or it indicates a relative clause with the referential pronoun omitted, this being fhi, \u0060about\u0027).",
  "And, mention, when We sent a company of jinn your way -- the jinn of Nasbn in Yemen, or the jinn of Nineveh, who were seven or nine, [and this was] while the Prophet (s) was leading the dawn prayer with some of his Companions at Batn Nakhla, as reported by the two Shaykhs [al-Bukhr and Muslim] -- to listen to the Qur\u0027n and, when they were in its presence, they said, that is, they said to one another: \u0060Listen carefully!\u0027, concentrate in order to hear it [carefully]. Then, when it was finished, [when] he was finished reciting it, they went back to their people to warn [them], to threaten their people with the chastisement [from God] if they do not believe -- they had been Jews, but then become Muslims.",
  "They said, \u0060O our people! Indeed we have heard a Book, namely, the Qur\u0027n, which has been revealed after Moses, confirming what was before it, what preceded it, such as the Torah. It guides to the truth, submission [to God] (islm), and to a straight way, that is, the way thereto [to Islam].",
  "O our people! Respond to God\u0027s summoner, Muhammad (s), by embracing faith, and believe in him, and He, God, will forgive you some of your sins, because some of these [sins] are wrongs [done to others] and which [therefore] can only be forgiven after those wronged are reconciled -- and shelter you from a painful chastisement.",
  "And whoever does not respond to God\u0027s summoner cannot thwart God on earth, that is to say, he will not be able to thwart God by escaping from Him and eluding Him, and he, the one who does not respond, will not have, besides Him, that is, [besides] God, any protectors, any helpers to ward off the chastisement from him -- those, who do not respond, are in manifest error\u0027, plain and evident [error].",
  "Have they not seen, [have they not] realised, that is, the deniers of resurrection, that God, Who created the heavens and the earth and [Who] was not wearied by their creation, [Who] did not fail therein, is able to give life to the dead? (bi-qdirin is the predicate of anna, \u0060that\u0027, the bi- having been added to it because the statement has the same force as [the construction]: a-laysa\u0027Llhu bi-qdirin, \u0060Is God not able ...?\u0027). Yes, indeed, He is able to give life to the dead. Indeed He has is able to do all things.",
  "And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire, when they are being chastised in it, it will be said to them: \u0060Is not this, chastisement, the truth?\u0027 They will say, \u0060Yes, by our Lord!\u0027 He will say, \u0060Then taste the chastisement for what you used to disbelieve [in]\u0027.",
  "So endure [with patience], the harm done [to you] by your people, just as the resolute, those of constancy and [power of] endurance during hardships, from among the messengers endured [with patience], before you, so that you may be one of resolve [like them] (min [of mina\u0027l-rusuli] is explicative, as all of them were men of resolve; but some say that this [particle min] is [actually] meant to be partitive, since excluded from their number are: Adam, on the basis of God\u0027s saying, exalted be He: And We did not find in him any constancy [Q. 20:115]; and Jonah, on the basis of His words: And do not be like the One of the fish [Q. 68:48]). And do not seek to hasten [it] for them, for your people, the sending down of the chastisement on them. Some say that he [the Prophet] seemed [by this stage] to have become exasperated because of them and desired that chastisement be sent down on them, which is why he was enjoined to [exercise] patience and to refrain from hastening the chastisement [for them] -- for it would befall them [eventually] without doubt. It shall seem for them, on the day when they see what they are promised, of chastisement in the Hereafter, given its long duration, as though they had tarried, in this world, by their reckoning, only an hour of a day. This Qur\u0027n is, a communication, a proclamation from God to you. So shall any be destroyed, that is to say, none [shall be destroyed] upon seeing the chastisement, but the immoral folk?, that is to say, the disbelieving [folk]. Medinese, except for verse 13, or [it is all] Meccan; it consists of 38 or 39 verses.",
  "Those who disbelieve, from among the people of Mecca, and bar, others, from the way of God, that is to say, [from] faith, He will leave their works to waste, such as giving food [to the poor] or being kind to kin, and so they will find no reward for these [works of theirs] in the Hereafter; [but] they are requited for them in this world [purely] out of His bounty, exalted be He.",
  "But those who believe, namely, the Helpers (al-Ansr) and others [like them], and perform righteous deeds and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad, namely, the Qur\u0027n -- and it is the truth from their Lord -- He will absolve them of, He will forgive them, their misdeeds and rightly dispose their mind, their state, so that they do not disobey Him.",
  "That, rendering void of their works and the absolution of evil deeds, is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, Satan, and because those who believe follow the truth, the Qur\u0027n, from their Lord. Thus, in the same manner of clarification, does God strike for mankind similitudes of themselves, [that is how] He clarifies for them their states, in other words, the disbeliever has his work rendered void while the believer is forgiven.",
  "So when you encounter [in battle] those who disbelieve, then [attack them with] a striking of the necks (fa- darba\u0027l-riqbi is a verbal noun in place of the [full] verbal construction, that is to say, fa\u0027drib riqbahum, \u0060then strike their necks\u0027), in other words, slay them -- reference is made to the \u0060striking of the necks\u0027 because the predominant cause of being slayed is to be struck in the neck. Then, when you have made thoroughly decimated them, bind, spare them, take them captive and bind firmly, the bonds (al-wathq is what is used to bind [ythaqu] a captive). Thereafter either [set them free] by grace (mannan is a verbal noun in place of the [full] verbal construction), that is to say, either show them grace by setting them free unconditionally; or by ransom, ransoming them with payment or with Muslim captives, until the war, that is to say, its participants, lay down its burdens, its heavy loads of weaponry and other things, so that either the disbelievers surrender or enter into a treaty. This [last clause] constitutes the \u0060purpose\u0027 of [enjoining the Muslims to] slaying and taking captive. So [shall it be] (dhlika is the predicate of an implied subject, [such as] al-amr, \u0060the ordinance\u0027, in other words, \u0060the ordinance [of God] regarding them is as mentioned\u0027). And had God willed, He could have [Himself] taken vengeance on them, without any fighting, but, He has commanded you to [do] it, that He may test some of you by means of others, from among them, by way of battle, so that the slain among you will end up in Paradise, while those [slain] among them [will end up] in the Fire. And those who are slain (qutil: a variant reading has qtal, \u0060those who fight\u0027) -- this verse was revealed on the day of [the battle of] Uhud, after the dead and the wounded had become numerous among the Muslims -- in the way of God, He will not let their works go to waste, He will [not] render [them] void.",
  "He will guide them, in this world and in the Hereafter to what benefits them, and rightly dispose their minds, their condition in both, with that [guidance and disposal] in this world being for those who were not slain, but who have been included in [the statement] \u0060and those who were slain\u0027 (qutil) because of [the] predominance therein [of those who were slain].",
  "And He will admit them into Paradise, which He has made known, [which] He has pointed out, to them, so that they are guided to their dwellings in it, and to their spouses and servants without asking to be shown the way.",
  "O you who believe! If you help God, that is to say, His religion and His Messenger, He will help you, against your enemy, and make your foothold firm, He will make you stand firm [while you fight] on the battleground.",
  "And as for those who disbelieve, from among the people of Mecca (wa\u0027lladhna kafar is the subject, the predicate of which is [an implicit] ta\u0060is, \u0060they shall be wretched\u0027, as indicated [by what follows]) wretchedness shall be their lot, that is, destruction and defeat from God. And He will make their works go to waste (wa-adalla a\u0060mlahum is a supplement to [the implied] ta\u0060is, \u0060they shall be wretched\u0027).",
  "That, wretchedness and wasting [of their works], is because they are averse to what God has revealed, of the Qur\u0027n with all that it includes of religious obligations (taklf), so He has made their works fail.",
  "Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? God destroyed them -- He destroyed them, their children and their possessions; and [a fate] the like thereof will be for the disbelievers, that is to say, the like of the fate of those before them.",
  "That, granting of victory to the believers and the vanquishing of the disbelievers, is because God is Patron, Ally and Helper, of those who believe and because the disbelievers have no patron.",
  "God will surely admit those who believe and perform righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they take their enjoyment, in this world, and eat as the cattle eat, that is to say, they are only concerned with [filling] their bellies and [satisfying] their private parts, without giving any thought to the Hereafter; and the Fire will be their habitation, their home, their station and their [final] destination.",
  "And how many (ka-ayyin means kam) a town, by which is meant the inhabitants thereof, mightier in power than your town, Mecca, that is to say, its inhabitants, which expelled you (akhrajatka [is feminine despite the plural sense of inhabitants meant is because it] takes into account the [feminine] form of qarya, \u0060town\u0027), have We destroyed (ahlaknhum takes into account the former [plural] import of qarya, \u0060town\u0027), and they had none to help them, against Our destruction [of them].",
  "Is he who follows a clear sign, a definitive argument and proof, from his Lord, and these are the believers, like those whose evil deeds have been adorned for them, so that they see them as fair [deeds], and these are the disbelievers of Mecca, and who follow their desires?, by worshipping graven images. In other words, there is no similarity between the two.",
  "A similitude, a description, of the Garden promised to the God-fearing: [the Garden] that is shared equally by all those who enter it (this first clause is the subject, of which the predicate [follows:]) therein are rivers of unstaling water (read sin or asin, similar [in form] to drib, \u0060striker\u0027, and hadhir, \u0060cautious\u0027), that is to say, one that does not change, in contrast to the water of this world, which may change due to some factor; and rivers of milk unchanging in flavour, in contrast to the milk of this world, on account of its issuing from udders, and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers, in contrast to the wine of this world, which is distasteful to drink; and [also] rivers of purified honey, in contrast to the honey of this world, which when it issues out of the bellies of bees becomes mixed with wax and other elements; and there will be for them therein, varieties [of], every fruit and forgiveness from their Lord, for He is pleased with them, in addition to His beneficence towards them in the way mentioned, in contrast to one who is a master of servants in this world, who while being kind to them may at the same time be wrathful with them. [Is such a one] like him who abides in the Fire?

  "And there are some among them, namely, the disbelievers, who listen to you, during the Friday sermon -- and these are the hypocrites; until, when they go forth from you, they say to those who have been given knowledge, that is to say, to the knowledgeable ones among the Companions [of the Prophet], such as [\u0060Abd Allh] Ibn Mas\u0060d and [\u0060Abd Allh] Ibn \u0060Abbs, in derision and mockery: \u0060What was he saying just now?\u0027 (read nifan or anifan, meaning al-s\u0060a, \u0060just now\u0027). In other words, [they mean to say] \u0060we will not go back to [listen to] him again\u0027. Those are the ones on whose hearts God has set a seal, of disbelief, and who follow their own desires, in [acting with] hypocrisy.",
  "But those who are [rightly] guided, namely, the believers, He, God, enhances their guidance and invests them with fear [of Him], He inspires them to [do] that by which they can be wary of [ending up in] the Fire.",
  "Do they, then, await, they do not await, namely, the disbelievers of Mecca, anything except that the Hour should come upon them (an ta\u0027tiyahum is an inclusive substitution for al-s\u0060ata, \u0060the Hour\u0027; in other words, it cannot be other than that it will come upon them [...]) suddenly? For already its portents, the signs thereof, have come, among which are the sending of the Prophet (s), the splitting of the Moon [Q. 54:1] and the Smoke [Q. 44:10]. So, when it, the Hour, has come upon them, for what [benefit] will their reminder be?, their remembering; in other words, it will be of no benefit to them.",
  "Know, then, that there is no god except God, that is to say, adhere, O Muhammad (s), to knowledge of this [fact] that will benefit you at the Resurrection, and ask forgiveness for your sin -- this was said to him, despite his infallibility (\u0060isma), so that his community might emulate him [in this respect]. Indeed he did do this. The Prophet (s) said, \u0060Verily I do ask God for forgiveness a hundred times every day\u0027 -- and for the believing men and believing women -- herein is an honouring for them, by having their Prophet enjoined to ask forgiveness for them. And God knows your going to and fro, your bustle during the day in pursuit of your business, and your place of rest, when you retire to where you sleep at night. In other words, He has knowledge of all your states, nothing of which can be hidden from Him, so be mindful of Him -- the address [in this verse] is meant for believers as well as others.",
  "And those who believe say, seeking to take part in the struggle: \u0060Why has a sra not been revealed?\u0027, [one] in which there is mention of the [command to participate in the] struggle. But when a definitive sra is revealed, one in which nothing is abrogated (naskh), and fighting, that is to say, requirement for it, is mentioned in it, you see those in whose hearts is a sickness, that is, doubt -- and they are the hypocrites -- looking at you with the look of someone fainting at [the point of] death, because of [their] fear of it and [their] aversion to it; in other words, they fear fighting and are averse to it. Yet more fitting for them (fa- awl lahum is a subject, the predicate of which [is the following, t\u0060atun wa-qawlun ma\u0060rfun])",
  "would be [to offer] obedience and honourable words, that is, [words] that are kind to you. Then, when the matter has been resolved upon, that is to say, [when] fighting has been prescribed, if they are loyal to God, in faith and obedience, it will be better for them (the sentence beginning with law, \u0060if\u0027, constitutes the response to idh, \u0060when\u0027).",
  "May it not be [the case] with you, (read \u0060astum or \u0060asaytum; there is a shift here from the third person to the second person address), that if you were to turn away, [if] you were to shun faith, you would then cause corruption in the land and sever your kinship ties?, in other words, [that] you would then return to the ways of pagandom such as belligerence and fighting.",

  "That, leading of them astray, is because they said to those who were averse to what God revealed, namely, to the idolaters: \u0060We will obey you in some matters\u0027, that is to say, by cooperating to maintain enmity against the Prophet (s) and preventing people from participating in the struggle alongside him: they had said as much secretly, but God, exalted be He, exposed it; and God knows their secrets (read asrrahum, as the plural of sirr, \u0060a secret\u0027, or isrrahum, \u0060their keeping [of things] secret\u0027, as the verbal noun).",
  "Then how will it be, their predicament, when the angels take them away, beating (yadribna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the angels) their faces and their backs?, with hooked iron rods.",
  "That, taking of them away in the state mentioned, is because they followed what angers God, and [because] they were averse to what pleases Him, that is to say, [they were averse to] doing what pleases Him. Therefore He has made their works fail.",

  "And if We will, We could show them to you, We could have pointed them out to you (the lm is repeated in [the following, fa-la-\u0060araftahum]), then you would recognise them by their mark.

  "And We will assuredly try you, We will assuredly test you by way of [commanding you to participate in] the struggle and in other ways, until We know, with knowledge outwardly manifested, those of you who struggle [for God\u0027s cause] and those who are steadfast, in [adhering to] the struggle and in other ways, and We will appraise, We will reveal, your record, in terms of [whether you acted with] obedience or disobedience in what concerns the struggle (all three verbs may be read with the [third person singular] y\u0027 or with the [first person plural] nn).",
  "Indeed those who disbelieve and bar from the way of God, the path of truth, and defy the Messenger, opposing him, after the guidance (this is the meaning of \u0060the way of God\u0027) has become clear to them, they will not hurt God in any way, and He will make their works fail, He will invalidate them, [good works] such as voluntary alms and the like, and so they will not find any reward for it in the Hereafter -- this was revealed either regarding those [Meccan] participants at [the battle of] Badr who provided food [for the needy], or regarding [the Jewish tribes of] Qurayza and al-Nadr.",
  "O you who believe! Obey God and obey the Messenger, and do not render your own works void, by [engaging in] acts of disobedience, for example.",
  "Indeed those who disbelieve and bar from the way of God, His path, namely, guidance, and then die as disbelievers, God will never forgive them -- this was revealed regarding the men of the Well (al-qalb).",

  "The life of this world, that is to say, preoccupation [solely] with it, is merely play and diversion; but if you believe and are wary, of God, [both of] which pertain to [the goal of] the Hereafter, He will give you your rewards, and will not ask you your wealth [in return], all of it, rather, only the alms that are required from it.",
  "If He were to ask you for it, and press you, demand it persistently, you would be niggardly, and this, niggardliness, would expose your rancour, towards the religion of Islam.",
  "Lo! there you are, O, those who are being called to expend in the way of God, that which has been prescribed for you; yet among you there are those who are niggardly; and whoever is niggardly is niggardly only to his own soul (one may say bakhila \u0060alayhi or [bakhila] \u0060anhu [to mean, \u0060he was niggardly to someone\u0027]). For God is the Independent One, [without need] of your expending; while you are the needy, of Him.

So ask forgiveness for us!\u0027, of God, for our failure to go forth with you.

The Companions, may God be pleased with them, are being described in this way, for at the outset they were weak and very few in number; but then their number grew and they acquired strength in the most wholesome way, so that He may enrage the disbelievers by them (li-yaghza bihimu\u0027l-kuffra is semantically connected to an omitted clause, which is suggested by what preceded, that is to say, \u0060they are likened to this [so that God may enrage the disbelievers]\u0027).

  "The following was revealed regarding al-Wald b. \u0060Uqba whom the Prophet had sent to the Ban al-Mustaliq in order to ascertain [their loyalty to Islam]. He already feared them on account of an old feud between him and them from the time of pagandom [before Islam], and so [upon seeing them come out to him] he returned and claimed that they had refused to give the voluntary alms and intended to kill him.

  "Verily he saw, in it, some of the greatest signs of his Lord, [some of] the most awesome [of these signs]. He thus saw from among the marvels of the Realm (malakt) a green drape (rafraf) that obscured the [entire] horizon of the heaven and Gabriel with his six hundred wings.",
  "Have you considered al-Lt and al-\u0060Uzz,",
  "and Mant, the third, of the preceding two, the other? (al-ukhr, a derogatory qualification of the third one). These were stone idols which the idolaters worshipped and which they claimed interceded for them with God (the first direct object of a-fa-ra\u0027aytum, \u0060have you seen\u0027, is al-Lt and what has been supplemented thereto; the second [direct object] has been omitted). The meaning then is, \u0060Inform Me: do these idols have the power over anything, such that you worship them besides God Who has the power over all that has been mentioned?\u0027 And because of their assertion also that the angels were God\u0027s daughters, despite their aversion to daughters, the following was revealed:",
  "Are you to have males, and He females?",
  "That, then, would indeed be an unfair division! (dzn, \u0060unfair\u0027, derives from dzahu, yadzuhu, to mean: \u0060he wronged him\u0027, \u0060he was unjust to him\u0027).",
  "These, that is, the mentioned [deities], are nothing but names which you have named, by which you have named, you and your fathers, idols that you worship. God has not revealed any warrant, [any] proof or evidence, for them, that is to say, [for] the worship of them. They follow nothing but conjecture, in their worship of them, and that which [ignoble] souls desire, of that which Satan adorned for them, that they may intercede for them before God, exalted be He, even though guidance has already come to them from their Lord, by the tongue of the Prophet (s), with definitive proof; yet they do not desist from their ways.",
  "Or shall man, that is, shall every human being among them, have whatever he wishes for?, such as [their wish] that the idols intercede for them. [No!] It is not so.",
  "Yet to God belong the Hereafter and the former [life], that is to say, [the life of] the world, and so nothing comes to pass in them except what He, exalted, wills.",
  "And how many an angel, that is to say, many an angel, there is in the heavens, and how honoured they are in God\u0027s sight [but], whose intercession cannot avail in any way except after God gives permission, to them for this [intercession], for whomever He wills, of His servants, and, with whom, He is satisfied, because of His saying: and they do not intercede except for him with whom He is satisfied [Q. 21:28]. It is also well- known that it [intercession] cannot be forthcoming from them except after permission for it has been granted: who is there that shall intercede with Him save with His leave [Q. 2:255].",
  "Truly those who do not believe in the Hereafter give the angels the names of females, for they say: \u0060They are God\u0027s daughters\u0027.",
  "But they do not have any knowledge thereof, of this claim. They follow, in this [respect], nothing but conjecture, which they have conjured up, and indeed conjecture can never substitute for the truth, that is to say, when it comes to acquiring knowledge of that which one is required to have knowledge of.",
  "So shun him who turns away from Our Remembrance, that is, [from] the Qur\u0027n, and desires nothing but the life of this world -- this was [revealed] before the command to struggle [against the disbelievers].",
  "That, namely, the desire of this world, is the full extent of their knowledge, that is, the limit of their knowledge, namely, that they have preferred this life to [that of] the Hereafter. Truly your Lord knows best those who have strayed from His way, and He knows best those who are [rightly] guided: He has knowledge of both and will requite both.",
  "And to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, that is, He owns [all of] that, among which [also] are the misguided one and the [rightly] guided one, leading astray whomever He will and guiding whomever He will, that He may requite those who do evil for what they have done, by way of idolatry and otherwise, and reward those who are virtuous, by [their] affirmation of [God\u0027s] Oneness and other acts of obedience, with the best [reward], namely, Paradise. He points out \u0060the virtuous\u0027 as being:",

Truly your Lord is of vast forgiveness, for such [lesser sins] and for accepting repentance. The following was revealed regarding those who used to say, \u0060[What of] our prayers, our fasting, and our pilgrimage!\u0027. He knows you best [from the time] when He produced you from the earth, that is to say, [when] He created your father Adam from dust, and when you were hidden [fetuses] (ajinna is the plural of jann) in the bellies of your mothers. So do not claim purity for yourselves, do not praise yourselves, that is, in admiration; but [if it is done] in recognition of [God\u0027s] grace, then that is fine. He knows best those who are God-fearing.",
  "Did you see him who turned away, from faith -- that is, [the one who] recanted when he was derided for it. He said, \u0060But I fear the punishment of God!\u0027. But when the one deriding him guaranteed him that he would bear God\u0027s chastisement for him, provided that he reverted to his [former] idolatry, and he then gave him a stated sum money, he reverted --",

  "It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, of the days of this world, the first of which being Sunday, and the last of which, Friday, then presided upon the Throne (\u0060arsh: [denotes] the kurs), a presiding [that was] befitting of Him. He knows what enters the earth, of rain and dead creatures, and what issues from it, of vegetation and minerals, and what comes down from the heaven, in the way of mercy and chastisement, and what ascends in it, of righteous deeds and evil ones.

For those of you who believe and expend -- an allusion to \u0060Uthmn [b. \u0060Affn], may God be pleased with him -- will have a great reward.",
  "And why should you not believe -- an address to the disbelievers -- in other words, there is nothing to prevent you from believing, in God when the Messenger is calling you to believe in your Lord, and a pledge has been taken from you (reading [it as] ukhidha mthqukum; otherwise akhadha mthqakum, \u0060He has taken a pledge from you\u0027) concerning it -- that is to say, God took this [pledge from you] in the world of atoms when He made them bear witness against themselves: \u0060Am I not your Lord?\u0027 They said, \u0060Yea, indeed\u0027 [Q. 7:172] -- if you are believers?, that is to say, if your intention is to believe in Him, then apply yourselves to this [duty of faith].",

Not equal [to the rest of you] are those of you who expended and fought before the victory, at Mecca. Such are greater in rank than those who expended and fought afterwards. Yet to each, of the two groups (a variant reading [for wa-kullan, \u0060yet to each\u0027] has nominative wa-kullun as a subject) God has promised the best reward, Paradise. And God is Aware of what you do, and will requite you for it [accordingly].",

Q. 7:46] -- with a gate, the inner side of which contains mercy, the side of the believers, and the outer side of which, the side of the hypocrites, faces toward the chastisement.",
  "They will call out to them, \u0060Did we not use to be with you?\u0027, upon [the path of] obedience. They will say, \u0060Yes, indeed! But you caused your souls to fall into temptation, by [engaging in] hypocrisy, and you awaited, reversals of fortune for the believers, and you doubted, you were uncertain about the religion of Islam, and [false] hopes, greedy desires, deceived you until God\u0027s ordinance, death, came; and the Deceiver, Satan, deceived you concerning God.",
  "So on this day no ransom will be taken from you (read tu\u0027khadhu or yu\u0027khadhu) nor from those who disbelieved. Your abode will be the Fire: it will be your guardian, it is [the place truly] deserving of you, and an evil destination!\u0027, it is.",
  "Is it not time for those who believe -- this was revealed concerning the matter of the Companions [of the Prophet] who had been overindulging in jest, that their hearts should be humbled to the remembrance of God and [to] what has been revealed (read as nuzzila; or read nazala, \u0060[what] has come down\u0027) of the truth, the Qur\u0027n, and that they should not be (l yakn is a supplement to takhsha\u0060a, \u0060be humbled\u0027) like those who were given the Scripture before?, namely, the Jews and the Christians. For the stretch of time, the interval [extending] from them [back] to [the time of the sending of the last of] their prophets, was too long for them and so their hearts became hardened, unyielding to the remembrance of God, and many of them are immoral.",
  "Know -- an address to the believers [just] mentioned -- that God revives the earth after its death, by [bringing forth] vegetation, and likewise He is able to do with your hearts, restoring them to humbleness.

  "Know that the life of this world is merely play and diversion and glitter, the frequent adornment [of oneself], and mutual vainglory in respect of wealth and children, that is, preoccupation with such things -- but as for acts of obedience and incentives thereto, these are the concerns of the Hereafter; as the likeness of, that is to say, it, in the manner in which you admire it and in the manner in which it will disappear, is as the likeness of, rain whose vegetation, which results from this [rain], the disbelievers, the sowers, admire; [but] then it withers, it becomes dried-up, and you see it turn yellow, then it becomes chaff, scatters vanishing with the winds. And in the Hereafter there is a severe chastisement, for those who prefer this world to it, and forgiveness from God and beatitude, for those who have not preferred this world to it; and the life of this world, that is to say, the comfort [enjoyed] in it, is but the comfort of delusion.",
  "Vie with one another for forgiveness from your Lord and a garden the breadth of which is as the breadth of the heaven and the earth, if one were placed at the end of the other, prepared for those who believe in God and His messengers.

  "We have verily sent Our messengers, the angels, to prophets, with clear signs, with the definitive proofs, and We revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance, justice, so that mankind may uphold justice.

  "Then We sent to follow in their footsteps Our messengers, and We sent to follow, Jesus son of Mary, and We gave him the Gospel, and We placed in the hearts of those who followed him kindness and mercy.

Yet they did not observe it with due observance, for many of them abandoned it and rejected the religion of Jesus and embraced the religion of their [then] king. However, many of them did remain upon the religion of Jesus and they believed in our Prophet [when he came]. So We gave those of them who believed, in him, their reward; but many of them are immoral.",
  "O you who believe, in Jesus, fear God and believe in His Messenger, Muhammad (s), and Jesus, and He will give you a twofold portion, share, of His mercy, for your belief in both prophets; and He will assign for you a light by which you will walk, across the Path [over Hell and into Paradise], and forgive you; for God is Forgiving, Merciful;",

She asked the Prophet (s) about this and he told her that she was [thenceforth] forbidden to him, as was customary among them [at the time of Jhiliyya], namely, that repudiation by zihr results in permanent separation. She was Khawla bt. Tha\u0060laba and he was Aws b. al- Smit -- and complains to God, of her being alone and of her impoverishment while having young children, whom if she were to leave with him, they would go astray, but whom, if they remained with her, would go hungry.

  "And those who repudiate their wives by zihr and then go back on what they have said, instead doing the opposite of this and retaining the woman divorced by zihr, that which is contrary to the purpose of zihr in which a woman is characterised as being forbidden -- then [the penalty for them is] the setting free of a slave, an obligation upon him, before they touch one another, in sexual intercourse. By this you are being admonished; and God is Aware of what you do.",
  "And he who cannot find [the wherewithal], [to set free] a slave, then [his redemption shall be] the fasting of two successive months before they touch one another. And if he is unable, to fast, then [the redemption shall be] the feeding of sixty needy persons, as an obligation upon him, that is, before they touch one another: understanding the unrestricted [prescription] as [having the same restriction as] the restricted one. For every needy person [he should give] one mudd measure of the principal food of the town. This, namely, lightening of the atonement is, so that you may believe in God and His Messenger. And these, namely, the rulings mentioned, are God\u0027s bounds; and for the rejecters, of them, there is a painful chastisement.",

And [who] when they come to you, they greet you, O Prophet, with that with which God never greeted you -- namely, their saying [to the Prophet]: al-smu \u0060alayka, meaning, \u0060Death [be upon you]\u0027, and they say within themselves, \u0060Why does God not chastise us for what we say?\u0027, in the way of such a greeting and [our saying] that he is not a prophet, if he [truly] were a prophet.

Htib b. Ab Balta\u0060a sent them a letter to that effect, on account of his having children and close relatives, idolaters, among them. The Prophet (s) intercepted it from the person to whom he [Htib] had given it to deliver, after God apprised him of this. Htib\u0027s excuse for this [conduct of his] was accepted [by the Prophet]; when verily they have disbelieved in the truth that has come to you, that is, [in] the religion of Islam and the Qur\u0027n, expelling the Messenger and you, from Mecca, by oppressing you, because you believe in God, your Lord. If you have gone forth to struggle in My way and to seek My pleasure ...

The keeping vigil by some of his companions in this way indicates their emulation of him. Some of them could not tell how much of the night they had spent in prayer and how much of it had remained, and would therefore keep vigil all night as a precaution; and so they used to keep vigil [in this way] for a whole year or more with their feet swollen, until God alleviated matters for them.

So recite as much as is feasible of the Qur\u0027n, during prayer, by performing as much prayer as is feasible. He knows that (an: softened in place of the hardened form, that is to say, annahu) some of you will be sick, while others will be travelling in the land, seeking the bounty of God, seeking of His provision through commerce and otherwise, and others will be fighting in the way of God: for each of the three groups mentioned the keeping of nightly vigil is hard, and so God has alleviated things for them by [enjoining on them] what is feasible.

Meccan or Medinese, consisting of 9 verses.",
  "Woe (waylun: an expression implying chastisement) to every backbiter, [who is a] slanderer, frequently engaging in backbiting and slander, that is to say, defamation -- this was revealed regarding those who slandered the Prophet (s) and the believers, the likes of Umayya b. Khalaf, al-Wald b. al-Mughra and others --",

  "Have you not considered (an interrogative meant to provoke marvel, in other words, \u0060marvel at\u0027) the way in which your Lord dealt with the Men of the Elephant?, who was named Mahmd, and the men were Abraha, King of Yemen and his troops. He had built a church in San\u0060\u0027 in order to divert pilgrims away from Mecca to it. A man from among the Ban Kinna defecated in it and stained its prayer niche with a deflowered virgin\u0027s blood, in contempt of it. Abraha then swore that he would knock down the Ka\u0060ba. So he approached Mecca with his troops riding Yemeni elephants with Mahmd at the vanguard. But when they turned to destroy the Ka\u0060ba, God unleashed upon them what He relates in His words:",

  "[In gratitude] for the security of Quraysh,",
  "their security (lfihim: repeated for emphasis; it is a verbal noun from [the verb] lafa) for the journey of winter, to Yemen, and, the journey, of summer, to Syria, every year: they made use of these two journeys to provide for their trade at the station [of Abraham] in Mecca, in order to attend to the House [of God], which was their source of pride; they [Quraysh] were the descendants of al-Nadr b. Kinna;",

  "Indeed it is your antagonist, your hater, who is the severed one, refraining from all [acts of] good, or the one whose line of offspring will be severed [by his not having any]: this was revealed regarding al-\u0060s b. W\u0027il, who called the Prophet (s) al-abtar, \u0060the severed one\u0027, when his son al-Qsim died. Meccan or Medinese, consisting of 6 verses; this was revealed when a band of idolaters said to the Prophet (s), \u0060What if you worship our gods for one year, and we worship your God the next?\u0027",

  "You have your religion, idolatry, and I have a religion\u0027, Islam: this was [revealed] before he was commanded to wage war [against the idolaters] (all seven Qur\u0027nic readers omit the y\u0027 of the genitive possessive construction [in wa-liya dni] whether with a pause or without; Ya\u0060qb, however, retains it in both cases). This was revealed at Min during the Farewell Pilgrimage, hence it is considered Medinese: it was the last sra to be revealed; it consists of 3 verses.",
  "When the help of God, for His Prophet (s), against his enemies, comes together with victory, the victory over Mecca,",
  "and you see people entering God\u0027s religion, that is to say, Islam, in throngs, in large droves, after they had been entering one by one -- this was after the conquest of Mecca, when the Arabs from all corners of the land came to him willingly [in obedience to his command] --",
  "then glorify with praise of your Lord, that is, continuously praising Him, and seek forgiveness from Him; for verily He is ever ready to relent. The Prophet (s), after this sra had been revealed, would frequently repeat the words subhna\u0027Llhi wa bi-hamdihi, \u0060Glory and praise be to God\u0027, and astaghfiru\u0027Llha wa-atbu ilayhi, \u0060I seek forgiveness from God and I repent to Him\u0027; with [the revelation of] this [final sra] he realised that his end was near. The victory over Mecca was in Ramadn of year 8; the Prophet (s) passed away in Rab\u0060 I of the year 10. Meccan, consisting of 5 verses. When the Prophet (s) summoned his people and said, \u0060I am a warner to you, [standing] before a terrible chastisement\u0027, his uncle, Ab Lahab, said, \u0060May you perish! Is that what you have called us out for?\u0027, whereupon the following was revealed:",
  "Perish, ruined be, the hands of Ab Lahab, in other words, all of him -- the use of \u0060hands\u0027 here to denote [all of] him is figurative, and is because most actions are performed by them; the statement is an invocation -- and perish he!, may he be ruined! (this [tabba] is a predicate, as where one says, ahlakahu\u0027Llhu wa-qad halak, \u0060God destroyed him and he indeed is destroyed\u0027. When the Prophet threatened him with the chastisement, he said, \u0060If what my brother\u0027s son says is true, then I shall ransom [myself] from it with my wealth and sons!\u0027; so the following was revealed:",
  "His wealth will not avail him, nor what he has earned (wa-kasab means wa-kasbihi, that is to say, his sons; m aghn means [m] yughn).",
  "He will [soon] enter a Fire of flames, that is to say, [a fire that is] flaming and ignited (this [statement] is the source of his nickname, [which was given to him] on account of his flaming reddish fair face),",
  "and his wife (wa\u0027mra\u0027atuhu is a supplement to the person [of the verb] yasl, \u0060he will enter\u0027, separated by the clause of the direct object and its qualification) -- and this was Umm Jaml -- the carrier (read hammlatu or hammlata) of firewood, cactus and thorns which she used to fling into the path of the Prophet (s).",
  "with a rope of palm-fibre around her neck (f jdih hablun min masadin is a circumstantial qualifier referring to hammlata\u0027l-hatab, which in turn is [either] a description of imra\u0027atahu, \u0060his wife\u0027, or the predicate of an implied subject). Meccan or Medinese, consisting of 4 or 5 verses. The Prophet (s) was asked about his Lord and the following was revealed:",
  "Say: \u0060He is God, One (Allhu is the predicate of huwa, \u0060He is\u0027, and ahadun is its substitution or a second predicate).",
  "God, the Self-Sufficient, Besought of all (Allhu\u0027l-samad constitute a subject and a predicate) [al-samad means] the One Who is always sought at times of need,",
  "He neither begot, for no likeness of Him can exist, nor was begotten, since createdness is precluded in His case.",
  "Nor is there anyone equal to Him\u0027, neither match nor comparison (lahu, \u0060to Him\u0027, is semantically connected to kufuwan, \u0060equal\u0027, but precedes it because it is the object of the intended negation; ahadun, \u0060anyone\u0027, which is the subject of yakun, \u0060is there\u0027, has been placed after the predicate of the latter [kufuwan, \u0060equal\u0027] in order to retain the harmony of the end-rhyme [of the verses]). Meccan or Medinese, consisting of 5 verses. This sra and the next one were revealed when Labd the Jew placed a spell on the Prophet (s) using a string with eleven knots. God informed him of this and of its place, and so it was brought before the Prophet (s) and he was commanded to \u0060seek refuge [in God]\u0027 by means of these two sras; and so each time he recited a verse from them, a knot would become undone and he would sense an alleviation, until in the end all the knots had been undone and he stood up invigorated, as if he had previously been hobbled to the ground.",
  "Say: \u0060I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak, the morning,",
  "from the evil of what He has created, of obligated animate beings and non-obligated ones and from all inanimates, such as poison and so on;",
  "and from the evil of darkness when it gathers, that is, [from] night when it becomes dark and the moon when it is absent,",
  "and from the evil of the women-blowers, sorceresses who blow, on knots, which they knot into strings, blowing into them [certain] words, but without spittle; however, al-Zamakhshar says, \u0060with this [spittle]\u0027 -- [sorceresses] such as the daughters of the said Labd --",
  "and from the evil of an envier when he envies\u0027, [when] he manifests his envy and behaves in accordance with it -- such as the mentioned Labd from among the Jews who were envious of the Prophet (s); the mention of these three [elements of evil] which are [already] subsumed by [the statement] \u0060of what He has created\u0027, is because of the severity of their evil. Meccan or Medinese, consisting of 6 verses.",
  "Say: \u0060I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind, their Creator and their Possessor: they [mankind] have been singled out for mention here in order to honour them, and a preface to seeking refuge from the evil of the one who whispers in their hearts;",
  "the King of mankind,",
  "the God of mankind (both [maliki\u0027l-ns and ilhi\u0027l-ns] are either substitutions or adjectival qualifications or explicative supplements; the repetition of the annexed word [al-ns] is meant as an additional explication),",
  "from the evil of the slinking whisperer, Satan -- he is referred to by the name of the action [waswasa] on account of his repeated engaging in it -- who slinks [away] and recoils from the heart whenever God is mentioned,",
  "who whispers in the breasts of mankind, in their hearts -- whenever they neglect to remember God,",
  "of the jinn and mankind\u0027 (mina\u0027l-jinnati wa\u0027l-nsi: an explication for the whispering Satan being of the jinn and [also] of the humans, similar to God\u0027s saying, the devils of humans and jinn [Q. 6:112]; or, mina\u0027ljinnati, \u0060of the jinn\u0027, is an explication for him [Satan], wa\u0027l-nsi, \u0060and [of] mankind\u0027 being a supplement to alwasws, \u0060the whisperer\u0027). Both [explanations] apply to the evil of the mentioned Labd and his daughters; the objection to the first opinion is that humans do not \u0060whisper\u0027 in the hearts of [other] humans, but that it is the jinn who whisper in their hearts: I would respond by saying that human beings also \u0060whisper\u0027 in a manner appropriate to them, [beginning] externally, whereafter their whispers reach the heart and establish themselves in it in the way in which this [customarily] happens. But God knows best what is correct, and to Him shall be the return and the final destination, and may God bless our master Muhammad and his family and Companions, and grant [them all] much peace, forever and always. God suffices for us and [what] an excellent guardian [is He]! And there is no power or might except in God, the Sublime, the Tremendous."
